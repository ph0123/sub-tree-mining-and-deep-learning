boomer		Don't Know Much About the Bible: Everything You Need to Know About the Good Book but Never Learned: Books: Kenneth C. Davis		2		Once again I am amazed by the amount of controversy associated with a book addressing a religious subject. <sssss> I bought this to get a better feel for the Old Testament [operative word is "feel"]. <sssss> As a Roman Catholic, the Old Testament is addressed in the first reading at Mass, but then brushed over for the most part in a cursory manner. <sssss> It is particularly confusing, hard to read, and difficult to understand in proper context, without some help. <sssss> In fact there are portions of the Old Testament that just seem cruel and ridiculous. <sssss> Davis's book helps to demonstrate that it was written by people, in a certain time and place, and within a historical milieu. <sssss> It may not maintain the historical accuracy some may like, but it is sufficient to be effective. <sssss> It is just too simplistic to look to the Bible for all answers; as if it were some sort of statutory code, with the answers to all questions. <sssss> The search and answers for truth are never ending, and the Bible is a beginning. <sssss> I get more from Catholic writers who explore the Bible and the traditions of my religion relative to our world, than I do from the book itself. <sssss> Davis is throwing in his spin, as well as a pretty accurate assessment of the Bible in historical context, which I found quite helpful. <sssss> Take it for what is worth, a spin in a convertible through the Bible. <sssss> A nice ride, but nothing more.
misha		Impossible: Books: Danielle Steel		1		if you have fond memories of ms steele, or no memory at all because you're new to her, please... don't read this book. <sssss> liam looks like a child with his long blond hair; he acts up because no one can control him since that's what his parents tried to do to him; he sees any "no" as a slap in the face because once again, that's what his parents did to him. <sssss> sasha looks like a cold woman with her pale skin and dark hair always pulled back; she is totally concerned about her reputation: "but what will they think of me?" <sssss> and can't stand up for her needs; she refuses to lower her standards, but when liam leaves, she falls into a "morbid depression" and goes back to him. <sssss> repeat for 300 pages... "careless," "self-indulgent," "filler" are three words i'd use to describe it
W. T. Wallace "NYPD Detective"		Mouthpiece: A Life in -- and Sometimes Just Outside -- the Law: Books: Edward Hayes,Susan Lehman		2		Ed Hayes exposes himself and one might think that the machine gun style of the book is fantasy but it doesn't do justice to the man himself. <sssss> His dedication to his clients is legendary and he spends every working moment thinking and working for them. <sssss> Having shared some of his adventures but as a cop,I found that he loves cops. <sssss> If it wasn't for the fact that he would not have been able to support his interesting lifestyle he would have been one. <sssss> His book covers his life and gives a glimpse into the man and his style. <sssss> He doesn't know how to go at half speed and neither does the book. <sssss> His upfront approach is evident. <sssss> He just doesn't have time for B.S. <sssss> It's a quick read and an enjoyable one. <sssss> Make sure that you take it with you on vacation! <sssss> It will make it more enjoyable
Greg Sever "erth2sever"		Sugars That Heal: The New Healing Science of Glyconutrients: Books: Emil I. Mondoa,Mindy Kitei		1		The book mentions Mannatech (notice the pppppppppp quot;manna pppppppppp quot;?) <sssss> and its product Ambrotose. <sssss> Snake oil, sugar pills! <sssss> Not backed by scientific studies. <sssss> All claims are anecdotal, i.e., are faith-based. <sssss> Mannatech products are peddled to the hopeful, the desperate, the last-chance-for-me's, and so this is not only doing a disservice to others, but is preying on people's weakness. <sssss> The company is set up like other pyradmid-schemed companies, using pppppppppp quot;associates pppppppppp quot; to pump its sugar pills, costing consumers a lot of money. <sssss> Folks, there is no instant solution in a pill. <sssss> The associates make claims for cleft lip, Down syndrome, obesity, all the terrible things human beings must bear in this world, and offer a pill made up of sugar to combat what is essentially a natural, human state. <sssss> In New Zealand and Australia, the govts. <sssss> are looking into Mannatech. <sssss> Beware! <sssss> The sugar pill recipe came in an inspiring moment to a scientist when in prayer to God. <sssss> Excuse me, but while I believe in the power of prayer, I do not believe God drops manna-pills from heaven. <sssss> God expects us to do our work, namely, don't overeat, live with that cleft lip, get some exercise, eat your vegetables and fruits, read good literature and enjoy the sunlight
Weddings From The Heart ~ Jean A. Neuhart		Bridal Flowers: Arrangements for a Perfect Wedding: Books: Maria McBride-Mellinger,William Stites		2		As a professional bridal consultant, I keep an extensive library of wedding related books on hand to help my brides design their own weddings. <sssss> Ms. McBride's Bridal Flowers is one of my favorites. <sssss> It is full of wonderful ideas - not just the traditional "must have" wedding flowers such as bouquets pppppppppp amp; boutonnieres, but the out-of-the-ordinary (but inspiring) boas, decorated lampposts pppppppppp amp; gilded calla lilies. <sssss> Ms. McBride shows that flowers are for more than just being carried or worn. <sssss> The large color photos are fantastic. <sssss> So many other books have little or no photos, or hand drawn diagrams that leaves the reader wondering. <sssss> Ms. McBride's book lets you see exactly what she is talking about. <sssss> It doesn't claim to be a how-to book, but perfect to take along when visiting your floral designer
J. Marren "jtm497"		East of Eden: Books: John Steinbeck		2		"East of Eden" is a beautifully written, sprawling, three generation saga of the men and women who settled the Salinas Valley in California. <sssss> The story begins far away in the East, on the farm of the unscrupulous Cyrus Trask and his two sons, Adam and Charles. <sssss> Adam is an upright, honest young man who naturally draws people to him, while Charles has an angry, violent spirit. <sssss> Charles tries in vain to earn the love of his father, and takes his anger at his failure out on Adam. <sssss> Adam is sent by his father into the army as a sign of his love, but Cyrus keeps Charles close to home, knowing that war would release something dangerous and violent in his other son. <sssss> Adam wanders for many years across the country after his service, and some of the most lyrical passages in the book describe his life as a tramp, closely mirroring Steinbeck's own experiences during the Depression. <sssss> Finally he returns to the farm and exists in uneasy partnership with Charles until the mysterious Cathy arrives. <sssss> The more astute Charles quickly realizes her true nature, but innocent Adam marries her and they move to California. <sssss> Adam expects Cathy to pursue his dream of life on a ranch, but Cathy is a vicious, evil character with no redeeming qualities, and after the birth of twin sons she escapes only to re-emerge much later when her sons are grown. <sssss> Adam hibernates for many years on the ranch, broken-hearted over Cathy's desertion, and convinced he must hide the secret from his sons forever, which become an impossible task. <sssss> Repeating the pattern of their father's life, the twins Aron and Caleb vie for their father's love, with Aron effortlessly winning it while Caleb comes to believe there is something evil lurking in his spirit. <sssss> But this time around, Caleb is redeemed in a way Charles never was. <sssss> Steinbeck's prose is masterful, and his descriptions of the Salinas Valley, lush with the rains, brutal with the drought, capture exactly why men were drawn to the west. <sssss> His portrayals of character and motives--sadly lacking in the movie--are totally convincing, and his Adam is a flawed but admirable character. <sssss> Steinbeck has been a bit out of favor--at least until this was chosen as an Oprah book. <sssss> As an English-as-a-second-language teacher I recently taught "The Pearl," and that book too surprised me with its gorgeous writing and subtle imagery. <sssss> (We all read it in high school but I now realize it went right over my head.) <sssss> Try Steinbeck again--you won't be disappointed--my book club wasn't!
The Moderately Insane "Sarah"		And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic: Books: Randy Shilts,William Greider		2		Having been born in 1981 I was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of HIV and AIDS. <sssss> But, this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic. <sssss> While lengthy, it is extremely informative and, if read with an open mind, refreashingly unbiased. <sssss> I found myself taking extra time and care in reading "And The Band Played On" just to let the information sink in.
K. Thalheimer		Hearts in Atlantis (G K Hall Large Print Book Series): Books: Stephen King		2		Masterfully thought out pppppppppp written. <sssss> Not your usual supernatural, horror King story. <sssss> Written in 4-5 completely different chapters there is some supernatural, but it begins as a story of some friends in childhood, follows them through the years pppppppppp culminates with them as adults. <sssss> Each chapter is completely different yet ties some characters in. <sssss> At the end they are all tied together in some ways years later. <sssss> It's ingenious in it's finale and I advise you set aside some time for reading. <sssss> It's very difficult to put down. <sssss> Once it grabs your interest, it just sucks you into the story. <sssss> If you remember your childhood friends (we all do) you'll identify with the story
A. M. White		The Giving Tree Special Holiday Edition: Books: Shel Silverstein		1		This book deserves no stars. <sssss> PLEASE stop buying and promoting this rotten book! <sssss> This is a book about a rotten, selfish self-centered male who takes everything including the life of the female tree. <sssss> Even at the end when he chops her down to sit on her as an old man, he's still unsatisifed and has a big scowl on his face! <sssss> The female tree gives and gives and gives, and the male (from boy to old man) just takes and takes and takes and is never satisified, happy or thankful. <sssss> What kind of story is that? <sssss> This is truly a rotten story. <sssss> Don't buy it! <sssss> Don't give this to your children!
Cookbook Collector		New Soul Cooking : Updating a Cuisine Rich in Flavor and Tradition (Melting Pot): Books: Tanya Holland,Ellen Silverman		1		I ordered this book through a bookclub and returned it. <sssss> It was terrible! <sssss> Tanya Holland is a beautiful Black woman, but I feel has gone too far out of the way to create "innovative and different" recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food. <sssss> The price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook. <sssss> I collect african american/soul food cookbooks among others. <sssss> If you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent, your money would be better spent on "Essence Brings you Great Cooking" by Jonell Nash, "The Ebony Cookbook" by Freida DeKnight or "The Black Family Reunion Cookbook" by the The National Council of Negro Women. <sssss> If you are interested in healthier soul food try, "The New Ebony Cookbook" by Charlotte Lyons or "The Family Dinner Quilt Cookbook" by The National Council of Negro Women. <sssss> If you are interested in diverse, cultural flavors, I would recommend Vertamae Grosvenor's cookbooks or "Iron Pots and Wooden Spoons" by Jessica B. Harris. <sssss> I have collected over 50 african american soul food cookbooks. <sssss> They cover the gamut. <sssss> That is why I can give an honest opinion on Tanya Holland's book. <sssss> I just wish that she would publish an african american cookbook that the average African American can relate to. <sssss> One that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking.
Heather L. Coates "bibliophile"		Dancing Naked at the Edge of Dawn: Books: Kris Radish		2		While I agree with several people who don't consider this chick-lit, I don't see why that is a bad thing. <sssss> I enjoyed Radish's writing style, purple prose and all. <sssss> If you're expecting a Dickensian journey into a complex character, this book is not it. <sssss> However, it does provide a snapshot of a woman forced to assess her life and choose between the road less traveled and her current miserable life. <sssss> Yes, the (positive and negative) circumstances of Meg's life were unrealistic, but I felt they were dramatized to make a point. <sssss> We all have strong, kind, and amazing people in our lives, but we have to look for these things in people. <sssss> I had an aunt just like Marcia, who fought her battles with a fantastic sense of humor, courage, and love for everyone around her. <sssss> The message I took from this book is this - life can be all you want if you simply take the time to nourish your own strength and that of those around you. <sssss> It doesn't take money to be powerful and satisfied with your life
Caitlin M. Guhl		Natalie: A Memoir by Her Sister: Books: Lana Wood		1		...but Lana Wood has a very autobiographical writing style. <sssss> I found Wood's memoir to be incredibly gossipy. <sssss> She speaks for pages upon pages about her own feelings during pivotal times in Natalie's life. <sssss> Every here or there, it's nice to have an eyewitness account of what happened at certain times, but I'd rather read about the Academy Awards for which Natalie was being nominated instead of the powerful men in Hollywood with whom Lana was sleeping. <sssss> There is a lot of name-dropping as well as a lack of substance in the book's context. <sssss> After reading this, I read Suzanne Finstad's NATASHA and found it to be very thorough and much more detailed about both her personal and professional life. <sssss> I was not a fan of this book in any respect
dog lover "chowbaka"		One at a Time: A Week in an American Animal Shelter: Books: Diane Leigh,Marilee Geyer		2		Loved this book. <sssss> I think that this is a must-read for anybody working in a shelter or rescue situation. <sssss> The only negative comment is that the people who really need to read the book are not going to read it. <sssss> Working in the field, we see first-hand the changes that need to be made in our thoughts on animals. <sssss> I wish that reading this book could be required before obtaining any animal. <sssss> I will say that I cried during parts of the book
lee freke "journalist"		The Count of Monte Cristo: Books: Alexandre Dumas		2		Most people are in awe of the "classic." <sssss> However, a book does not pick that title on the whim of a professor of arcane texts, rather a book gains such when it constantly and consistently speaks about the human condition. <sssss> Classics do not only thrill and teach, they also live. <sssss> The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is a classic. <sssss> This tale of accusal, love, betrayal, imprisonment, redemption, and retribution, defies genre. <sssss> Recounting the plot serves no purpose, so I will simply surmise that most readers focus on vengeance at the expense of reward. <sssss> Edmond Dantes could not have desired living just to kill those who wronged him; he expected to return to those who remained faithful. <sssss> Here Dumas, using Dantes, Sinbad, Albert and Abbe Busoni, championed a nonviolent stoicism which exposes a person to death to experience life. <sssss> The Count of Monte Cristo is a vivid potrayal of French life after the Revolution, an epic account of a man's quest for closure and an inspiration for the Shawshank Redemption. <sssss> It is never too late to read it
Lucas Jay		The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America: Books: Jonathan Kozol		1		I am a teacher at an inner-city school that struggles with the same issues presented by Kozol. <sssss> That said, this is the fourth of Kozol's works that I have read, and I came away just as disappointed with "The Shame of the Nation" as I did with the rest of them. <sssss> I am so incredibly sick of him shouting from the mountaintops that there is a problem with public education. <sssss> He acts like we don't already know. <sssss> He acts like there is some unseen solution out there that should be obvious to everybody. <sssss> Instead of pointing fingers and and complaining about it, why doesn't he use his experience and know-it-all knowledge to offer real, concrete and practical solutions? <sssss> Kozol is a classic Monday-morning quarterback pointing out the flaws in what everybody else is doing - but he doesn't get his hands dirty anymore. <sssss> If he is really as educationally omnipresent as he thinks he is, the least he could do is offer some solutions. <sssss> I've made four mistakes. <sssss> I will not make a fifth. <sssss> I have 150 underpriveleged kids to teach, and I can't afford to waste my time on another volume of complaints while he points out the obvious
Mother of Two		Junie B Jones Collection Books 1-4: Books: Barbara Park,Lana Quintal		1		I agree with some of the negative reviews that the Junie B. Jones books often use language and depict behavior that are less than desirable. <sssss> My son, who is a pretty sensitive boy, didn't like Junie B. Jones because he thought she was rude. <sssss> I would much prefer that my kids read books with kids who, though they may get in trouble from time to time or may make mistakes, are generally nice people. <sssss> We did love the Magic Tree House series, both for the adventure and the personalities of Jack and Annie
"thehighlandway"		Take It Personally: How to Make Conscious Choices to Change the World: Books: Anita Roddick		2		Ms. Roddick has managed to put together some important issues, outstanding commentators, and good information design in one place with this book. <sssss> I read it through from cover-to-cover (I seldom do this) and found myself both enlightened and inspired. <sssss> I recommend it highly
Mike Smith		The Crossing (Random House Large Print): Books: Cormac Mccarthy		2		Reading this book is like having a holy vision: I feel as if I should tell the world about it, but at the same time it seems so sacred and personal that maybe I should just keep it to myself and try to figure out why it came to me, into my life, into my head. <sssss> The book is the story of Billy Parham, a son in a late-1930s New Mexican ranching family. <sssss> Billy traps a wolf that has been killing his father's cattle but realizes he can't kill it and has to return it to its home in the mountains of old Mexico. <sssss> Billy crosses the border into Mexico, and as he does he crosses from real life into a world of dreams, where everyone moves as if the air was liquid, where every ruin has an irretrievable story, where soot and heat and danger hang in the air, and where nothing ever goes as planned. <sssss> The story is not as streamlined or as focused as its thematic predecessor, "All the Pretty Horses," but that's not necessarily a shortcoming. <sssss> The book sprawls out like a wide hot desert--curling north and south, east and west, across the present and into the past. <sssss> The writing is as good as any writing I've ever read ever, and certain metaphors and feelings will stay with you for years. <sssss> For example: the coals of a campfire seeming like an exposed piece of the core of the earth. <sssss> This is a book that needs to be read. <sssss> Pick it up, and let it seep into your skin, let it open you to other worlds and peoples and ideas, and let it change you. <sssss> Let it open your eyes to the world, and to the West, and the goodness and the hope and the sadness that haunts the lives of all of us. <sssss> This is a book made of all those ineffable things that most of us just can't put into words. <sssss> But here, somehow, Cormac McCarthy has managed to do just that. <sssss> Here is the intangible, but tangible. <sssss> Here is the unnameable, but named. <sssss> Here are the thoughts you could never express, expressed.
Jessica Haynie		Vanishing Acts: Books: Jodi Picoult		2		Again, Jodi Picoult is excellent. <sssss> You are truly able to engolf yourself in the characters and thier emotions
California dreamin'		Cover of Night: Books: Linda Howard,Joyce Bean and Dick Hill		1		I think the Linda Howard who wrote White Lies, Sarah's Child, Duncan's Bride, MacKenzies Mountain, Diamond Bay,etc. <sssss> is one of the most talented current romance writers. <sssss> Unfortunately, when she gave up the genre romances and turned to the "big Time", her writing started to decline. <sssss> She is clearly in over her head now. <sssss> What a shame she couldn't stick to a format in which she excelled and warmed the hearts of millions of readers. <sssss> This just goes to show that one should figure out where one excels and stick to it. <sssss> This is pure "Peter Principle" in action. <sssss> Too bad
Paper Mulberry- G. Hampton "PaperGuy"		Streetwise Complete Business Plan With Software: Interactive Software to Quickly Create a Powerful Business Plan Plus a Comprehensive Book (Adams Streetwise Series): Books: Bob Adams		2		I have purchased probably 5 business plan books and software packages over the last 8 years. <sssss> None of them were clear enough or easy enough to get me through the process of writing a good, complete business plan. <sssss> This one really works. <sssss> I sat down with the book and software, and over the course of a week, wrote a business plan that has received great results. <sssss> Every business owner needs a business plan and this is somethig that you really do have to do for yourself. <sssss> Unfortunately, writing a good business plan does not come easily to many people. <sssss> This book will get you through the process, and you will end up with a good plan. <sssss> My only complaint is that the software is windows only
Book Reader		Digital Fortress: A Thriller: Books: Dan Brown,Paul Michael		1		This book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually NO understanding of computer systems by the author. <sssss> I don't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving, but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes, firewalls and hacking techniques, those details must be fairly correct. <sssss> In this case, the technical details were so wildly implausible that I finally had to stop reading. <sssss> The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details. <sssss> The NSA almost certainly doesn't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet (through any combination of firewalls) but if they did, they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked. <sssss> Besides all that that, the characters were cliched and not well developed. <sssss> This is all too bad, because the plot was interesting and I would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoide
Acute Observer		The Invisible Man: Books: Scott Brick		2		It was a cold and snowy February day when a stranger walked to a small country inn and ordered a meal and a private room. <sssss> This stranger guards his privacy and desires solitude. <sssss> His luggage consists of many bottles of powders and fluids as would be used by an experimental investigator. <sssss> The local general practitioner visits the stranger, and sees something he can't believe. <sssss> Then someone steals money from the Reverend Bunting although he and his wife see nobody. <sssss> Later Mr. pppppppppp Mrs. Hall, innkeepers, see the stranger's room is empty, until the chair moves around as if possessed by spirits. <sssss> When questioned by Mrs. Hall the stranger removes his nose! <sssss> Then the bandages and spectacles go, and the people see no head! <sssss> When the constable comes to arrest him, the man removes all his garments and disappears into thin air. <sssss> The crowd tries to grab him but he escapes. <sssss> Mr. Thomas Marvel, a wandering tramp, is found by this Unseen and convinced to work for him. <sssss> They return to the inn to fetch books and clothing. <sssss> This sets off a commotion among the people there, and another chase. <sssss> The panicked people fled from the streets and locked themselves in their homes. <sssss> There was a story about "flying money" that was removed from shops and inns. <sssss> At another inn Marvel seeks shelter, he has escaped from the Invisible Man. <sssss> When this Unseen enters to take Marvel away, a bearded American fires at the Unseen with his revolver. <sssss> Later the Unseen visits a physician for treatment of his wound (his blood can be seen). <sssss> The Unseen has met Dr. Kemp at college, and is fed and clothed. <sssss> The Unseen explains the scientific principles of optical density in a general way. <sssss> If the refractive index of a substance was lowered to that of air it would be invisible in most cases (Chapter XIX). <sssss> The Unseen kept his work secret because of the thefts in the scientific world of science. <sssss> But the Unseen acquired money by foul means which cursed his work! <sssss> Griffin tells of the previous experiments that led to invisibility (Chapter XX). <sssss> The next chapters gives Griffin's history. <sssss> But Kemp has written to the police, and they arrive. <sssss> Griffin escapes once again, and Kemp warns the police about what must be done (Chapter XXV). <sssss> Griffin is mad and inhuman, "pure selfishness". <sssss> His attempts to kill Kemp lead to his own destruction, and his body becomes visible after death (Chapter XXVIII). <sssss> If accurate, this story provides a snapshot of life in London and its suburbs at that time. <sssss> It also tells that carrying arms was nothing unusual. <sssss> H. G. Wells shows his literary skills in making believable an impossible condition. <sssss> There are those who still believe that describing something in words makes it real (like "childproof guns", etc.). <sssss> Readers of Wells' later works can judge how close to the truth his writings were. <sssss> This fable warns against uncontrolled scientific experiments, from poison gas to atomic bombs, or the current craze for cloning or "genetic modification" The story of unseen theft of money can also be a warning against a Private Banking Cartel and its continual devaluation of the currency to help Big Business in its struggle against small businesses and working people. <sssss> In this story the people unite to terminate the Unseen; this doesn't always happen in the real world.
Monica G. "Monica G."		Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing: Books: Christiane Md Northrup		1		Dr. Northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies, stages of life and medical procedures. <sssss> However, I was appalled by her bias against Western cultural heritage and Christianity. <sssss> Her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced, with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women. <sssss> As a Catholic whose best teachers were strong-minded, compassionate religious sisters, I felt offended by her slur against nuns. <sssss> I am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing, but I would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research.
Jay Marriott		Forever Cool: How To Achieve Ageless, Youthful, and Modern Personal Style: Books: Sherrie Mathieson		1		I bought this book but should have listened to my gut feeling...look at the picture of the "Forever Cool" Ms Mathieson on the cover. <sssss> She keeps saying GET RID OF THE GLASSES in the "before" pictures but she should take her own advice. <sssss> The before pictures of women are so bad that "duh" the after pictures do look better. <sssss> However the over-all impression is that the book "teaches" you how to dress so you blend in in suberbia, not how to be individually stylish or dress to look like anything except someone with a credit card who went to the local shopping mall and bought whatever was socially acceptable.
Juliana Volcheck		The Healer Within: Using Traditional Chinese Techniques To Release Your Body's Own Medicine *Movement *Massage *Meditation *Breathing: Books: Roger Jahnke		1		On the plus side, this book is fairly easy to understand and contains sufficient pictures of the exercises. <sssss> I was very excited at first, but unfortunately none of the exercises, massages, meditations, etc I tried seemed to help any of my health problems, even after a month. <sssss> The book contains inspiring stories of people who have quickly recovered from serious illness or injury, yet leaves me crying in disappointment. <sssss> I will probably keep trying a few of the exercises and methods for awhile, but I don't hold any hope of them suddenly starting to work at this point
C. Wong		The drama of the gifted child and the search for the true self: Books: Alice Miller		1		Most of the information is very "theoritical" and "limited" -- author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her. <sssss> ... <sssss> In a nutshell, the message is that a dysfunctional mother'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter(s), and in turn, the daughter(s) may pass that onto her offspring(s). <sssss> ...
Jami Anderson "JLHS"		How the Other Half Lives: Studeis Among the Tenements of New York (Bedford Series in History and Culture): Books: Jacob A. Riis,David Leviatin		1		How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. <sssss> The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. <sssss> This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s. <sssss> He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart. <sssss> Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. <sssss> His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. <sssss> He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: "How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man." <sssss> (p. 266). <sssss> He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. <sssss> Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers. <sssss> Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, "If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose." <sssss> The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: "This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. <sssss> cities." <sssss> How does this book relate to adult education? <sssss> By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? <sssss> Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem. <sssss> "Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man." <sssss> (p. 147). <sssss> He does not forget that this "education" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. <sssss> "Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant." <sssss> (p. 270). <sssss> Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity. <sssss> "It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society." <sssss> (p. 233). <sssss> The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society. <sssss> Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. <sssss> I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. <sssss> In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. <sssss> Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm: Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards, Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. <sssss> The list goes on. <sssss> To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country. <sssss> Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City: Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. <sssss> I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race. <sssss> I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. <sssss> Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. <sssss> I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. <sssss> Does every generation think that is happening in their time? <sssss> Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. <sssss> It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity.
S. Long "Texas Book Fan"		The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors: The Extraordinary World War II Story of the U.S. Navy's Finest Hour: Books: James Hornfischer,Barrett Whitener		2		The author brought more than the story of the battle to light. <sssss> He was able to give insight into the lives of the sailors and their thoughts during the battle
John D. Hernandez Jr. "jdhtampa"		One: Books: Richard Bach		2		This book was mind expanding, and told a great story of exploring the facets of one's personality and how much that personality is interdependent with his wife and others. <sssss> My favorite part was the story of the "Golden Pages" where a person is taught by the wise man that truth of man's existence is inspiring and worthy of discovery, but to share that truth with others is subjecting oneself to ridicule and criticsm, if not war
James Bunnelle		The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering: Books: Norman G. Finkelstein		2		Kudos to Finkelstein for having the courage to tackle such subject matter. <sssss> The fact that he himself, a descendent of Holocaust survivors, has been attacked and derided for writing it just goes to prove one of his underlying points: you cannot criticize the state of Israel or its proponents without being labeled an anti-Semite. <sssss> Any discussion of their illegal occupation or the countless UN resolutions condemning them is tantamount to sympathizing and promoting terrorism. <sssss> By far one of the most interesting sections is the portion dealing with the Swiss banks; this version also has an updated appendix that covers rulings left out of the hardcover edition. <sssss> Finkelstein does come across overtly hostile at times but his anger is justified and those holding it against him seem to blow it a bit out of proportion. <sssss> Very odd that those on the far left and far right both give accolades to this work. <sssss> Hilberg's endorsement carries a tremendous amount of weight, and those unfamiliar with his seminal multi-volume set The Destruction of European Jews would be well served to check it out
Q		The Major Film Theories: An Introduction (Galaxy Book ; Gb450): Books: J. D. Andrew		2		First, the strengths: Andrew gives intelligent summaries and discussion of some major historical film theorists, with chapters on Munsterberg, Arnheim, Eisenstein, Balazs, Kracauer, Bazin, Mitry, Metz, and Ayfre, and Agel. <sssss> He focuses on the debate between the formalists (who believe film art is defined by its formal properties including editing, framing, mise-en-scene, lighting, and etc.) <sssss> and the realist tradition (who believe that film art is defined by its basis in photography, a physical impression of its subject). <sssss> The highlight is undoubtedly Andrew's excellent discussion of the great French critic Andre Bazin, which is not surprising since Andrew's Ph.D thesis was on Bazin. <sssss> The weaknesses: This was published in 1976, and so it completely ignores the vast body of criticism published since then, especially feminism, and the influence of Lacan and psychoanalytic theory. <sssss> Still, this is not a bad starting point for students of film theory
Arb Trader		How To Get Started In Electronic Day Trading: Books: David S. Nassar		1		bought book flipped through for 5 minutes, found good use starting a woodfire. <sssss> all the info contained can be had for free on the internet. <sssss> if youve been trading more then 2 days you already know more then the scope of this boo
Paul Cook		Independence Day: Books: Richard Ford		1		From the remarks at this site, people either love this novel or hate it. <sssss> I hated it. <sssss> I hated it for the reason that it represents all that is bad about MFA program writing in the last 30 years. <sssss> The emphasis is entirely on STYLE. <sssss> Forget story. <sssss> Forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the narrative. <sssss> Just throw out and string together wonderful language and the reader will follow you anywhere. <sssss> Some of this thinking goes back to Henry James, some of it goes back to Virginia Woolf who was so terrified of books with plots or dominating conceits (like H.G. <sssss> Wells' THE TIME MACHINE). <sssss> The first 100 pages of this novel are about a real estate deal and the people to whom Frank Bascombe is trying to sell a property. <sssss> It's brilliantly written. <sssss> In fact, it's so brilliantly written that I had a lot of problems seeing a former sportswriter being so introspective and articulate about his life, his loves, and the region of the country he inhabits. <sssss> This book has no driving plot. <sssss> In fact, it's an arbitrarily chosen conceit: what happens on July 4th in the life of one guy. <sssss> It's not James Joyce's ULYSSES nor is it trying to be, but EVERY thought this man has is in this book. <sssss> And none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person--any perso--should pick up the book. <sssss> Indeed, that seems to be the crux. <sssss> I read this book because it was by Richard Ford, a man whom all of my colleagues in the mainstream fiction world revere. <sssss> You must read this book, they said. <sssss> So I did. <sssss> And I consider it an extraordinary waste of my time. <sssss> To be sure, this is a judgment call, but I'm allowed to make it. <sssss> EVERY reader is allowed to make that call. <sssss> But I know I'm in the minority in this. <sssss> This book is supposed to be one of the greatest American novels of the last 25 years. <sssss> But will it be so in another 25 years? <sssss> Are novels now only to be interior monologues (which Virginia Woolf preferred and said so in her essay "Modern Fiction")? <sssss> Perhaps our values are changing. <sssss> Perhaps the MFA programs in this country are correct in only cultivating style rather than story. <sssss> But what it eventually evolves into is a form of narcissism, wherein the author writes at length, putting on the page all of his or her thoughts about whatever and we're supposed to . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> what? <sssss> Applaud it? <sssss> I believe that the authors we'll remember will be the natural storytellers. <sssss> I don't think Richard Ford is one of them. <sssss> But, man, he sure can write
J. Lindner		Harper's Bible Dictionary: Books: Paul Achtemeier		2		This Bible dictionary is a one volume source for nearly everything associated with or found in the Bible. <sssss> It covers the Bible cover to cover with personalities, places, themes, concepts, etc. <sssss> Anyone who needs a resource for Bible studies or just for general knowledge will want to own this book. <sssss> Church libraries should have it available for library users. <sssss> This is an excellent resource. <sssss> The editors chose authors who can write succinctly and clearly when they write on their subjects. <sssss> Readers will appreciate the thoroughness as well as the readability of this book. <sssss> I can't emphasize it enough. <sssss> This book is a must have for anyone interested in the Bible
Lisa Bahrami		The Last River: The Tragic Race for Shangri-la: Books: Todd Balf		1		One of the blurbs I read on the book jacket compared this book to Into Thin Air and The Perfect Storm. <sssss> No way!. <sssss> Those two books were edge-of-your-seat reading experiences. <sssss> This account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring. <sssss> The action doesn't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then, the cliched writing and deification of Balf's subjects make this book very hard to get through. <sssss> Unless you are a serious kayaking fan, I would not recommend this book
gattaromana "gattaromana"		Basin and Range: Books: John McPhee		1		I had to read this book for an Intro to Geology course, and although I find geology to be fascinating, I had a very difficult time following this book. <sssss> The author uses a lot of technical vocabulary and is rather repetitious. <sssss> Although I understood what McPhee was talking about most of the time, I think it would have made a better film documentary than a book. <sssss> The author constantly went off on tangents and the overal organization of the book did not appeal to me at all. <sssss> . <sssss> .it would be more readable if written as a field journal because I could not even figure out when one day turned into another. <sssss> But the book did a decent job of presenting the bigger picture
Z. Norwood "Conscious Consumer"		Is There a Text in this Class?: The Authority of Interpretive Communities: Books: Stanley Fish		1		The notion of "interpretive communities" is at best derivative of Kuhn's classical work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and at worst a framework of obstruction employed against those who wish to revivify literary theory and criticism in the wake of postmodern hegemony
susan belsinger		The Juicing Bible: Books: Pat Crocker,Susan Eagles		2		i couldn't help myself when i opened the juicing bible--i should have been doing other things--but i spent over an hour perusing the pages. <sssss> it contains a wealth of information on fruits, herbs, and vegetables and their healing properties. <sssss> the layout is handy and it is easy to find things with the detailed indices. <sssss> the recipes are simple, clearly written, and sound delicious. <sssss> i am excited and inspired. <sssss> in fact, i'm going to get my juicer off of the bottom shelf of the pantry and go for it
A. Cohen		The Dogs of Bedlam Farm: An Adventure with Sixteen Sheep, Three Dogs, Two Donkeys, and Me: Books: Jon Katz		1		The back cover to this book was intriguing, and captured me immediately. <sssss> The writing, however, was so plodding, so inconsistent, and so non-sequential that it was painful to get through to the end. <sssss> This is aside from the fact that this man appears to be socially inept and unable to manage his affairs from day to day. <sssss> I can't believe that this book made it past the editors. <sssss> In one paragraph Jon Katz tells how Rose is the only dog for the job of helping him capture his runaway herd of sheet, and in the next he says that Rose is too young to herd sheep. <sssss> In one paragraph he can't live without his wife, she gives his very existence meaning, and throughout the book he describes how he lives apart from her in order to...what was it again? <sssss> Oh, right, herd sheep! <sssss> At one point the dog he loves the most is also the one he can't connect to and finally gives away. <sssss> And then can't stop visiting, even though everyone knows how confusing that would be to a dog. <sssss> And why is he wondering why the world looks at grown men funny when they hang around too much with teenage boys - there's a reason, Jon! <sssss> If you care at all about literarure, stay away from this book
Meme F.		Food Art: Garnishing Made Easy: Books: John Gargone		2		Not only was the book cheaper on Amazon than the bookstores but I ordered this book for my boyfriend from here and I got it earlier than expected so that was great! <sssss> He says it has great step-by-step images and that's a positive for him since he learns more from visuals. <sssss> Also, it has instructions that he's able to follow and understand. <sssss> We both just wish it had more "food art" in the book but, overall, it's a great book
"punchbug4"		Piano for Dummies: Books: Blake Neely		2		I bought the book the other day and breezed right thru it. <sssss> It's great in that you can skip around the book to the sections you NEED to read (or refresh yourself on). <sssss> I keep it handy because I often refer to it. <sssss> It is thorough in explaining various aspects of reading music, playing, etc. <sssss> The humor interspersed makes it enjoyable to read rather than boring but the humor doesn't detract from the content and lesson. <sssss> Glad I bought it and you should buy it, too, if you want to teach yourself how to play
N. Champeny		Strength Training for Women: Books: Joan Pagano		2		I bought this book to start free weight training at home. <sssss> It is wonderful for home use. <sssss> The author describes the benefits of weight training and how to lift weights properly(which I found very useful as a first time weight lifter). <sssss> I love the descriptions that the author gives for each exercise. <sssss> The author also color codes which exercises to do for each level of training. <sssss> I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is first starting out with free weights.
sonia_pcar@yahoo.com		A Late Divorce: Books: A. B. Yehoshua		2		A Late Divorce is one of my very favorites novels. <sssss> This ordinary tale about the late divorce of a middle-aged couple, one of whom is in a mental institution, is told from the perspective of each member of the family: children, their spouses and mates, grandson,etc. <sssss> I have rarely laughed so much, or been touched so much, by the insightful description of the Kaminka family and their travails over a failed marriage, real estate and conflict. <sssss> The scene with the rabbis at the mental institution is literary hilarity at its best...A wonderful work, original, illuminating and FUNNY
Todd R. Garrett "SlyFoxTodd"		Natural Nutrition for Dogs and Cats: Books: Kymythy Schultze		2		This book provides a straight-forward approach to a raw-food diet, and the changes required to maintain the health of your pet through the process. <sssss> It also helps to have someone who can assist you in locating the ingredients locally, but Schultze provides all the requisite information that you will need. <sssss> A great resource to go to when you get a nagging question, or have a concern. <sssss> Try not to let people talk you out of trying the diet, as you WILL see changes in the health of your pet; many veterinarians that I have spoken with are not particularly supportive. <sssss> My 2 y/o Lab has a softer coat, clearer eyes, and better muscle tone since I have started him on the diet. <sssss> This diet is slightly more expensive than feeding dog chow, but the reward of having a healthy, happy pet far outweigh the associated costs. <sssss> Good luck, and enjoy your pet
David Krause		Blessings: Books: Anna Quindlen,Joan Allen		2		Loved it. <sssss> Highly suggest it. <sssss> Couldn't put it down
Prometheus "zosimos"		The Origins of Totalitarianism: Books: Hannah Arendt		2		Hannah Arendt's _The Origins of Totalitarianism_ is a book that takes a hard look at two rival totalitarian movements in the twentieth century, Soviet Communism and Nazism, and traces their historical roots. <sssss> The book is divided into three volumes focusing on Antisemitism, Imperialism, and Totalitarianism. <sssss> The first of these volumes is concerned with the historical origins of Antisemitism. <sssss> Arendt examines some of the ways historians have dealt with the historical roots of Antisemitism. <sssss> For example, some historians have argued based on a "scapegoat theory" that the Jews were used as an innocent scapegoat for the world's ills. <sssss> Arendt concludes that such approaches are flawed because they fail to take into account the full historical situation of the Jews. <sssss> Arendt explores the rise of Antisemitism in the birth of the nation-state, the emancipation of the Jews, the rise of the Jewish financiers, the roles of Jews within society, and the infamous Dreyfus affair. <sssss> Of particular interest here is the role of conpiracy theories concerning such individuals as Benjamin Disraeli or the infamous forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. <sssss> The idea that the Jews constitute a race or are members of secret societies or clubs played an important role in the historical development of Antisemitism. <sssss> The second of the volumes in this book is concerned with the rise of Imperialism. <sssss> Here, a discussion of racism and racial thinking is examined involving such racial theorists as Count Arthur de Gobineau and various forms of Social Darwinism. <sssss> The role of the Boers in South Africa is looked at and a thorough examination of the lives of such individuals as Cecil Rhodes, who called for the creation of a secret society of aristocratic Nordic elite, is made. <sssss> The great Pan Movements, Pan-Slavism, Pan-Germanism, and the Pan-Arabism of T. E. Lawrence are dealt with and their subsequent roles in the creation of the totalitarian states is explored. <sssss> The final volume of this book is concerned with Totalitarianism proper. <sssss> Here, the role of propaganda and the secret police, as well as terror and the concentration camps are dealt with in their place in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. <sssss> Arendt explores each of these issues and shows why they are so particularly disturbing. <sssss> Arendt contends that totalitarianism sought to annihilate the nature of man completely. <sssss> Repression and terror abound within the totalitarian state and freedom is virtually nonexistent. <sssss> Written during the Cold War period and just after the Second World War, this book takes an important look into the minds of such totalitarian leaders as Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin. <sssss> Their movements of Nazism and Soviet Communism continue to haunt the modern world even though they have been largely extinguished. <sssss> The book is important today not only for historical reasons, but also because it gives a unique view of the world within a totalitarian society and the unique political danger that such totalitarian movements and institutions causes for the modern world
Jerryhorse "Jerryhorse"		The Constitution of Liberty: Books: F. A. Hayek		1		At the height of socialist popularism in England, cir. <sssss> 1944, George Orwell, a leading proponent of socialism, believing in its promises as did many,if not most of Eurpose's leading intellectuals and politicians, wrote a review of Hayek's famous book, "The Road to Serfdom." <sssss> Orwell wrote the review in the "Observer," London April 9,1944. <sssss> Hayek, mentions this fact as a footnote in chapter 17 of his classic book, "The Constitution of Liberty" published in 1960, as evidence of the disillusionment of socialist intellectuals, when they were confronted with the observation that individualism and socialism were mutually exclusive. <sssss> Those same intellectuals had not accepted the proposition when advanced by Karl Mannheim in his book, "Man and Society in an Age of Reconstrucion" (1940). <sssss> Mannheim had been a long opponent of socialism, but Orwell had only been converted after being exposed to "The Road to Serfdom." <sssss> By 1960, when Orwell had become a world renowned author and staunch opponent of Big Brother doublespeak, Hayek recognized that the political proponents of socialsm which was dying as a political ideal, were now introducing the concept of the welfare state. <sssss> While virtually everyone alive today have been effected by Orwell's works and his prescient warnings about Big Brother, how many of us are aware of Hayek's infulence on him? <sssss> "The Constitution of Liberty" provides its readers with an enormous wealth of knowledge, of which this one footnote is only a small example. <sssss> Each reader is bound to be effected in one way or another by the knowledge imparted to them, and this is one of the main lessons to be learned about "liberty" which requires the "rule of Law" to exist in today's society, but that Rule of Law must be understood. <sssss> The failure of today's inteligencia is to fail to fully comprehend the meaning of liberty and its necessity in a world full of confusion from the confrontation of competing civilizations. <sssss> Unfortunately, Hayek is no longer alive to help guide us through the new millenium. <sssss> Fortunately, he has left us a large volume of work, perhaps more relevant today than it was when written years ago. <sssss> While "The Constitution of Liberty" is voluminous in itself, it should be kept as a reference book. <sssss> Hayek's other works, "The Road to Serfdom" and his last published volume, "Fatal Conceit-the Evils of Socialism" published in 1980 is a magnificent continuation of Hayek's life long discertation on the evolution of mankind's growth from a tribal, familial society which did not require man to understand or protect Liberty, to a group of city-states that prospered because of the Liberties protected in Athens, but only moderately understood, so that such a great and wise philosopher as Aristotle would believe that freedom could only exist as far as a man could yell. <sssss> Hayek's understanding that Western Civilization has prospered from individualism, that it has grown and prospered from the freedom to travel, to trade, to exchnge property, material, real and intellectual. <sssss> He explains why man must be humble, that humans progress from trial and error, not from conceited belief that one way or another way is correct. <sssss> That to be free and liberated is to be free to make mistakes and government should exist to protect individuals'rights to make mistakes while they attempt to profit in their own ideals and beliefs.
Librum "6nomad9"		The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story: Books: Richard Preston		1		If HZ's sensationalist title gives you pause, you're on to something. <sssss> The "story" Preston narrates is, indeed, terrifying. <sssss> It is a story about disease, politics, epidemiology, history, geography... <sssss> So much could have been made of this story (and so much has been, by far more capable writers). <sssss> Preston, it seems, is only capable of going for the jugular. <sssss> HZ shows no evidence of research (it lacks even a trace of a bibliography), and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp, on the part of its author, of the history, epidemiology, or politics of Ebola (no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic). <sssss> From its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab, to its closing page 'death-defying' romp through Kitum Cave (how very brave of you, RP! <sssss> ), HZ is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode. <sssss> If this book was not a thinly veiled Hollywood screenplay, I'll eat my proverbial hat. <sssss> Even this might have been tolerable were Preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer. <sssss> HZ is all cliches and lazy reporting. <sssss> It is an embarassment
Trish New "hopedealer"		Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Book 2): Books: J.K. Rowling,Jim Dale		1		An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. <sssss> The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a monster is lurking. <sssss> Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. <sssss> Age group interest: early teen. <sssss> I wanted to see what all the rave was about. <sssss> Lots of action, not much morale. <sssss> Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal
D. Blackman		Busting Loose From the Money Game: Mind-Blowing Strategies for Changing the Rules of a Game You Can't Win: Books: Robert Scheinfeld		2		lIKE A MYSTERY NOVEL AT FIRST THEN LIKE A FICTIONAL JOKE BUT CRAZY AS IT SOUNDS IT WORKS. <sssss> It is intresting to apply the guidlines Bob recommends for getting out of the rut of lifes financial strifes and other problems of life. <sssss> I found it easy to understand and even if it challenges your lifes beliefs keep reading . <sssss> Good Stuf
Sugar Pie		Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-6): Books: J. K. Rowling		1		My problem was that these books were missing chunks of pages! <sssss> We didn't notice it until book 4 of 6, but 80+ pages were gone! <sssss> Now, Amazon was great about replacing the set adn paying for me to return the messed-up set. <sssss> This is just a warning to check your boxed set when it gets in for missing chunks of pages! <sssss> Of course, the Harry Potter series is great, adn we love having them in paperback
Ronald Scheer "rockysquirrel"		Dispatches: Books: Michael Herr		2		My hat's off to anyone who can sum up this book in a customer review. <sssss> It is beyond anything I've ever read in its portrayal of men at war as witnessed by the war correspondents who accompany them on the front lines. <sssss> Unlike the embedded journalists of our own time, the writers and photographers who covered Vietnam were much closer to being free agents, restricted only by their ingenuity and fearlessness to seek out the action that would represent the essence of America's military presence in southeast Asia ("There it is . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> ), while the evidence everywhere was of an irrationality raised to such a pitch that it had become something driven only bit itself. <sssss> Unable to remain objective or even conceive of objectivity, Herr and his colleagues yield to a kind of hallucinatory experience, depicting the war as a phantasmagoria, a really bad trip that also seduced them with what one of them insists is a compelling glamour. <sssss> To read this book is to experience Vietnam not as a historical record or analysis, or even a personal memoir, but as a kind of hypnotic nightmare from which many, including survivors, never wake
Mr. J. Woods		LaVarenne Pratigue: Books: Ann Willan		2		If you are into Cooking than this is the Book you must have. <sssss> This is not another recipe book but a complete culinary referance for both novice cook and expert
Kim Griffin		The CISSP Prep Guide: Mastering the Ten Domains of Computer Security: Books: Ronald L. Krutz,Russell Dean Vines,Edward M. Stroz		2		I liked this prep guide because it's not one of those huge books that's impossible to fit in your carry-on or laptop bag if you're traveling. <sssss> It has enough information to pass the test, which is good enough for me because that's all I needed to pass the test this month. <sssss> But, if you're one of those people who has a need to get every single question right, this is not the book for you. <sssss> The book doesn't cover every single thing you need to know for the exam, just enough to pass it. <sssss> The only draw back to this book is that it doesn't come with a CD with a comprehensive set of sample test questions. <sssss> I had to go to one of those huge books that I bought a couple of years ago for that, but I didn't read the huge book
"s-ray"		Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth, pppppppppp Art: Books: Lewis Hyde		1		Imagine, just as I was getting bored with this book, through an odd act of contingence its binding literally fell apart in my hands. <sssss> A Loki-Eshu-hermetic encounter? <sssss> What a thankful rescue. <sssss> Rambling and indulgent, such repetition would be better kept to a long essay rather than a full book. <sssss> A trickster's story, indeed
Catalina Sanchez "Tatatiu"		The Official Robosapien Hacker's Guide: Books: Dave Prochnow		1		Why? <sssss> because I was expectin something else, but first of all, I didn't expect that you have to open/make a hole in your Robosapiens to modify it, so forget it! <sssss> i will not damage my Robot
Bruce J. Edwards		Morrie: In His Own Words: Books: Morrie Schwartz		2		Ever since Tuesdays With Morrie I have been intrigued by ALS and the ways that people cope with its devastating debilitation. <sssss> Morrie has given us so much with his aphorisms and insights regarding living life
san antonio girl		Running with Scissors: A Memoir: Books: Augusten Burroughs		1		I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... <sssss> So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. <sssss> I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. <sssss> The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. <sssss> I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book
April Hutchinson "arhutch"		Running the Spiritual Path: A Runner's Guide to Breathing, Meditating, and Exploring the Prayerful Dimension of the Sport: Books: Roger Joslin		2		If you are a runner, you may have experienced the mental benefits that running provides. <sssss> You may have also felt a spiritual presence while running, perhaps saying a prayer or working through personal problems while on the trail. <sssss> In this extraordinary book, Joslin explores this mind/body connection and gives many different ways to experience the spiritual side of the sport. <sssss> He shares meditative techniques developed over many years and very rich personal experiences with excerpts from his running journal. <sssss> The book is well thought-out and written with a great deal of humility and care. <sssss> This is one that I will read again and again. <sssss> It changed the way I approach running. <sssss> I also think about this book throughout the day, even when I am not running. <sssss> A great book
D. Gaffney		The Next Great Bubble Boom: How to Profit from the Greatest Boom in History: 2006-2010: Books: Harry S. Dent		1		This book is old news and is filled with predictions for 2005 pppppppppp 2006 - most of which are inacurate. <sssss> His boom and subsequent bust theories are not materializing - and at this point even if they do will be of much smaller scale than his grand predictions (DOW over 40,000) presented in this book
Ranger1		Hard Truth (Anna Pigeon): Books: Nevada Barr,Joyce Bean		1		I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. <sssss> Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. <sssss> It feels very contrived. <sssss> It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. <sssss> This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series.
Amy Ross "advice columnist"		Other Voices, Other Rooms: Books: Truman Capote		1		Creepiest book ever. <sssss> How can I describe it? <sssss> It's like waking from fevered dreams to find yourself in a bathtub filled with molasses and blood, and flies crawling in and out of your eyes, your nose, the corners of your mouth. <sssss> It is unpleasant. <sssss> I don't know, I hate to be the philistine, and I suppose it's a good thing that these books exist, for other people, but for me? <sssss> I don't want to live in such ugliness
Jennifer Lichtenfeld		Subterranean: Books: James Rollins		2		A team of highly respected scientists is recruited and sent on the most exciting mission of their careers - they are to explore and catalog an expansive system of tunnels and caves deep below the Earth's surface in Antarctica. <sssss> They set off on their adventure only to learn that a team, like themselves, was sent on this same mission only 3 months prior and has never been heard from again. <sssss> They also learn that what makes this set of caverns so exciting and sought after is that they contain diamonds larger and more plentiful than any mankind has ever seen. <sssss> Wealth of this sort has attracted both dedicated scientists and individuals with more menacing plans in mind. <sssss> But these dangers are nothing compared to the beasts that are native to this subterranean world who are numerous and life threatening to the mission and the team. <sssss> James Rollins' debut novel sets the stage for what has become his successful career writing scientific thrillers. <sssss> He does a wonderful job of incorporating biology, archeology, geology, and other various earth sciences into an exciting and page turning novel. <sssss> Some of his subsequent novels are stronger than this first work, but Subterranean does not disappoint and definitively sets the stage for his many books to come.
Caren K. Beach		PSYCH-K...The Missing Peace In Your Life!: Books: Robert M. Williams		2		I have spent my life wishing that I could change things over which I seemed to have no control. <sssss> Rob explains that the reason for this is that my subconscious mind is holding on to old beliefs that are limiting me. <sssss> He goes on to tell how PSYCH-K is a safe, powerful, and simple way to change those beliefs using balances that integrate the hemispheres of the brain. <sssss> It is prayer coming true for me quickly and lastingly. <sssss> I have followed up reading the book by taking the Basic and Advanced training workshops and am using PSYCH-K to find "peace" in my life and am helping others do the same in theirs. <sssss> This book is written so that it is easy to read and very informative for someone like me who is looking for ways to improve their life
Nevermore		Post-capitalist Society: Books: Peter Drucker		1		It certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that knowledge-based workers are the future in American Society. <sssss> It seems to me that Drucker spent too much time attempting to criticize Marx, which was a complete failure. <sssss> Drucker didn't even fully analyze Globalization in its entirety. <sssss> The only credit that should be given to this book is his analyzation of the American worker. <sssss> Nonetheless, he offers a limited viewpoint on all aspects of society. <sssss> Look elsewhere if you want to get a better understanding of where our world is headed and what state we are in. <sssss> Drucker neglects the whole and simply accepts what backs his own perspective
"yesandy"		The Business of Consulting: The Basics and Beyond: Books: Elaine Biech		1		Sure this book is only for beginner or outsider of Cosulting business. <sssss> But then, for the price of this book, I would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas - such as Consulting for Dummies. <sssss> The book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant; But come on, Consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural, systematic yet creative thinking. <sssss> Overall, I think this book is a waste of money for experienced consultant. <sssss> While for beginner, the reader will risk the wrong impression that it's this easy to win a consulting work - highly unlikely in a complex and competative world
Linda Pagliuco "katknit"		Darkness, Take My Hand: Books: Dennis Lehane		2		I picked up this paperback because my curiosity was stimulated by watching Mystic River, the film based on another LeHane novel. <sssss> Darkness, Take My Hand did not disappoint. <sssss> Different characters, same setting, and identical sense of insanity and irredeemable evil. <sssss> LeHane's prose is intelligent and witty without being overbearing, a welcome change from many other authors who crank out formulaic , hackneyed language and stories in the crime genre. <sssss> LeHane's descriptions jump right off the page at you. <sssss> His characters are so human, so intense, their dialogue so sharp, that it's almost like watching a movie in your mind. <sssss> There isn't a wasted word in this book. <sssss> The suspense starts to build on page 1, and never lets up, becoming more and more menacing with each subsequent chapter. <sssss> This is a stay-up-late read to finish only when you're NOT alone in the night. <sssss> LeHane's other works top my summer reading list. <sssss> I'd love to see what he could do in a different genre
J. Behrle "loser blogger pppppppppp cartoonist pppppppppp poetic love god"		The Best American Poetry 2006: Series Editor David Lehman (Best American Poetry): Books: Billy Collins,David Lehman		1		This smugly-edited series has become a dreary example of careerist nepotism and features mainly short stories with linebreaks and jokey poems that are not funny. <sssss> Some choice awful lines: Denise Duhamel: "Don't give into your cravings, you need to stay lean / So you can lift up your skirt as you prance and twirl..." Kim Addonizio: "Better dead then fed. <sssss> / He who laughs will not last. <sssss> / Sticks and stones will break you," Thomas Lux: "that the eyes be gouged out / and replaced by hot coals / in the head, _the blockhead_,/ of each countrymen or woman who, / upon reaching their majority, / has yet to read MOBY DICK..." Most of the poems herein, besides Franz Wright and Paul Violi among a scattered few, would have been better off as just titles than full poems. <sssss> The big name poets featured have generally written better poems, the younger poets all seem to have some connection to the New School. <sssss> It's incredibly disappointing: THE BEST AMERICAN POETRY 2006 could have been so much more. <sssss> Instead, *it's* a joke
A. Watson "Romance Enthusiast"		Toxic Bachelors (Danielle Steel): Books: Danielle Steel		1		I wanted to cry when I put this book down because I miss the Danielle Steele that wrote 'Thurston House', 'Family Circle' and others. <sssss> For years now I have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers. <sssss> I really feel like her heart just isn't in it anymore. <sssss> She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable. <sssss> Every book has her main character 'being honest.' <sssss> I keep reading because I am a loyal Danielle Steele fan and I write this in hopes she'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it (like she once did) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works. <sssss> This book was just awful.
Nikkita		The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth: Books: Benjamin M. Friedman		1		Mr. Friedman's book begins with an interesting thesis, defining morality and its definition within a context of economic growth. <sssss> The idea that economic growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a logical argument that Friedman often well supports with historical facts. <sssss> However, the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his own thesis, or if he just felt the need to write a book. <sssss> Furthermore, for every chapter in the book, there seem to be at least one or more flawed arguments or points that, with a little thorough thought or research, don't make sense or can easily be disproven. <sssss> With these things being the case, I find Friedman's argument a little hard to buy. <sssss> The entire book seems to build up to the final chapter, which Friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in economic growth; this final chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely, however, because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book (ie. <sssss> the importance of education) do not add or support his final policy recommendations. <sssss> His policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an economics class as responses to the question "What should the government do to promote economic growth?" <sssss> They don't push the argument forward or indicate anything that hasn't already been suggested in the past, nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies.
William E. Adams		Break No Bones: A Novel: Books: Kathy Reichs,Dorothee Berryman		1		I've read five of the nine "Temperance Brennan" mysteries that Kathy Reichs has published, but this is my least favorite. <sssss> I lost interest about two-thirds through. <sssss> I felt the villains were not fleshed-out, the murder mystery too complicated and unlikely, the ending too neatly contrived, and the personal/romantic side story too awkward. <sssss> This one was also too long, by about 50 pages. <sssss> Reading it felt like eating a stew in which there were a multitude of ingredients, yet they did not blend into a successful flavor. <sssss> The other four of her novels were fine. <sssss> I love the TV series as well, although "Bones" allegedly shows Dr. Brennan much earlier in her career, with the supporting cast and the job duties and locations totally different than what is found in the books. <sssss> In the TV series, "Dr. Brennan" has a steady cast of supporting characters who grabbed my mind and heart very quickly. <sssss> In the books, her lesser characters all seem...lesser, indeed. <sssss> Better luck next time out, Dr. Reichs
Samatha Parker "Sam"		Small Bites: Books: Jennifer Joyce		2		I made 4 dishes from the book for my girlfriends and all of the recipes were a huge hit. <sssss> The carmelized onion and spinach dip was amazing as well as the tomato and ginger soup. <sssss> I especially like the 'buy and arrange' features which give you clever stylish ideas for easy dishes to throw together if you don't have alot of time. <sssss> No more 3 course meals for me, I'm going all appetizers.
Cynthia Marie Rizzo		Mommy?: Books: Maurice Sendak,Arthur Yorinks,Matthew Reinhart		2		This book is fun comical book for children who want to read something mysterious. <sssss> This cute book gives the reader the enthusiasm in turning the pages to see what happens of the young boy going into a creepy house focusing on the search of his mother. <sssss> Cynthia Marie Rizzo, author of "Julie and the Unicorn" and "Angela and the Princess
Mary		Worst Pills, Best Pills: A Consumer's Guide to Avoiding Drug-Induced Death or Illness: Books: Sidney M. Wolfe,Larry D. Sasich,Peter Lurie		1		Unfortunately, Sidney Wolfe and the whole "Worst Pills" business enterprise is riding on the reputation of Public Citizen as a champion for consumers, but has failed to live up to it with this guide. <sssss> In some cases, warnings are included regarding various drugs that are not based on scientific reports, but rather, are based on the marketing literature and information from the pharmaceutical companies themselves -- hardly an unbiased, consumer-oriented source of information. <sssss> Consider as one example the book's "Do Not Use" warning regarding the prescription drug, Armour Thyroid. <sssss> Rather than offering any research to support this severe recommendation (because there ISN'T any research), the "guide" instead quotes the AMA and the American Thyroid Association, two groups that greatly enjoy the largesse of the thyroid drug makers who want to put Armour -- a far less expensive drug -- out of business. <sssss> If this is the sort of "unbiased information" you want about the drugs you take, you might as well go ahead and just read the pharmaceutical company pamphlets. <sssss> If millions of thyroid patients taking Armour Thyroid were to follow the advice in "Worst Pills," the only thing that ends up for the worse is our health. <sssss> I definitely do NOT recommend this book in any way. <sssss> -- Mary J. Shomon, Thyroid Patient Advocate and Autho
Jerry Sanchez		The Emperor of Ocean Park: Books: Stephen L. Carter		2		The reader that keeps with this book will be rewarded. <sssss> The conversations in the book are intelligent, the characters and dialogue are real, and the descriptions and settings are vivid. <sssss> While the author provides a lengthy disclaimer at the end of the book explaining how the fictional university and town in the book are not based upon Yale and New Haven, it is sometimes hard to believe, especially given that the author has been a faculty member at Yale Law School for over twenty-years. <sssss> This is not to say, however, that the descriptions in the book of the law school and town are inaccurate. <sssss> Rather, they may provide quite an accurate description of a town torn between those affiliated with a prestigious university (Yale) and those that are not. <sssss> In short, I enjoyed this book because it kept me guessing and the pace was just right. <sssss> This is not a read-it-in-one-day thriller that Grisham might come up with. <sssss> Instead, this is a much more intellectual read. <sssss> What I enjoyed most about the book are its insights into life itself. <sssss> Carter uses fictional characters to explore the good and bad sides to marriage and family life, careers, law, and racism in this country. <sssss> If you are willing to keep reading when the story seems slow and to learn and grow with the characters (especially Talcott), believe me, this book will reward you, and you'll be glad you read it
Todd Justman "audio book reader"		Agincourt: Books: Christopher Hibbert,Christopher Hibbert		1		The chief problem with this book is that the writer incorporates the French perspective by using citations in French with no translations. <sssss> I took 2 years of high school French but I'm not that good! <sssss> This could be overlooked except that, for obvious reasons, I was very interested to hear the perspective of French writing on this lopsided defeat. <sssss> The experience was like someone telling a long joke and them mumbling the awaited punchline, or someone tearing out the last page of a riveting mystery novel. <sssss> I simply can't believe key citations weren't translated. <sssss> Otherwise the study of Henry V was great, and I would like to hear more about him (except since he died young I probably heard it all already.) <sssss> The treatment of the battle was superficial, but perhaps given the lack of material this could be understood, but more could be done
		Five-Point Play: The Story of Duke's Amazing 2000-2001 Championship Season: Books: Mike Krzyzewski,Donald T. Phillips		2		my son chris played on this team. <sssss> i love coach k as he has gotten me a job and new car. <sssss> duke has saved my family's life . <sssss> this is a great book and all duke fans should read it. <sssss> FIST! <sssss> - vivian harpe
Theresa W		The Pelican Brief (John Grishham): Books: John Grisham,Anthony Heald		2		Having read most of Grisham's books, I've saved a few of his "best" for last. <sssss> While it wasn't a 5 star book like I'd hoped, it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one. <sssss> Having saw the movie years ago, I had a good idea of what the book was about: Two Supreme Court Justices are killed, a law school student, along with many other people become curious and try to figure out "who dun it"...only, she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head, and when the wrong people find out, she's on the run for her life! <sssss> I enjoyed the book mostly because it was fast-paced, and had a lot of detail. <sssss> So much detail and characters, I had a bit of a struggle to keep up! <sssss> Of course it was suspenseful and the characters, especially of Darby, the law school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover the truth. <sssss> Good read
C. Cornish		Three To Get Deadly (A Stephanie Plum Novel): Books: Janet Evanovich		2		I found #10 at a garage sale and thought I better just start at #1. <sssss> I have buzzed through to #12 and through out them all I have found myself laughing out loud.
J. Herron "cooking girl"		How to Eat: The Pleasures and Principles of Good Food: Books: Nigella Lawson,Arthur Boehm		1		I am a chef and an avid collector of cookbooks. <sssss> I find the recipes of this book to be mediocre at best, terribly organized and lengthy. <sssss> I am not interested in Lawson's endless anecdotes, rather, I would prefer her stories to be replaces by pictures (an essential for cooking books, in my opinion), of which there are none. <sssss> I was disappointed, and would not recommend this book to anyone. <sssss> For basic, great recipes, I would suggest any of Ina Garten's books. <sssss> Her recipes are no-fail and the books are well done.
Carolyn "Life's best spent as a goddess being pampered by well oiled cabana boys"		Killer Dreams: Books: Iris Johansen,Jennifer Van Dyck		1		I've read every one of Iris Johansen's "suspense" novels and have loved most of them. <sssss> The last couple though have been so painful to get through. <sssss> This one however, I don't think I can even finish. <sssss> I read where someone called these characters "cardboard," and I couldn't agree more. <sssss> The female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist. <sssss> Whereas in the Eve Duncan Books and the Wind Dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class. <sssss> "Now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after." <sssss> I hope that Iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time.
L. Thomas "mstish101"		Abide with Me: Books: E. Lynn Harris		2		I read Any way the wind blows pppppppppp Not a day goes by before I read Abide with me. <sssss> If you happen to come into the series of E. Lynn's books and want more of the scoop on Basil's problems with his past, Raymond's lifestyle, the true 'not-so-divafied' evil side of Yancey and they're mutual friends...then you should start with this one! <sssss> It'll help you put 'two pppppppppp two together' on the lives and backgrounds of all of the characters
"bermie"		20,001 Names For Baby: Revised and Updated: Books: Carol McD. Wallace		1		This book turned out to be a disappointing resource. <sssss> Although the book includes 20,001 names, many are unlikely and outlandish (Klotild, Edwige, Ghislain, Ethelbert, Birtle), making it arduous to sift through to find the names more worthy of consideration
Joanne Stewart		Dating Game (Danielle Steel): Books: Danielle Steel,Sam Freed		1		My grandmother and my mother have read Danielle Steele for years, but I must admit I'd never picked one up. <sssss> I was always more for historical romances. <sssss> But I wanted something different, had heard good things about her, so while at the library, decided to give her a try. <sssss> I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. <sssss> Granted, I'm a fellow writer (a very picky reader by nature), and an unpublished one to boot, but the writing could've been better in my opinion. <sssss> The first five pages are all backstory of Paris's marriage (no action, no excitement, told very "history lesson-ish") and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between Paris and her husband (the inciting incident in the first chapter) left me wondering, "So what?". <sssss> Twenty five pages in, I could care less about these people. <sssss> I honestly expected more from a bestselling author.
David W. Nicholas		Krakatoa CD: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883: Books: Simon Winchester,Winchester Simon		2		Simon Winchester is a popular historian, in the modern mold. <sssss> This means that he's socially and politically a liberal, and that he's interested in *everything* connected with a specific event. <sssss> He'll examine it from all angles, and attempt to see it from everyone's eyes, look over everything connected with it, and then draw some conclusions. <sssss> Usually, those conclusions over-reach some (I'm being general about this type of writer, not of Winchester specifically) and the point of view is relentlessly modern. <sssss> Winchester has chosen as the topic of this book the explosion of the volcano Krakatoa in 1883. <sssss> Interestingly, the author is trained as a geologist, though he has spent most of his life working as a journalist and writer. <sssss> This means that he actually understands the terminology of geology and vulcanology enough that he can at least make an attempt to explain it to the rest of us in layman's terms, and the result is generally a happy one. <sssss> Krakatoa was a complex event (the island had three summits, each a separate volcano: two disappeared in the explosion, but they erupted for a good while beforehand, and their effects lasted for years afterwards) and Winchester does a good job of relating what happened, the prelude to it, and the aftermath. <sssss> The one criticism that people have which I agree with is that he tends to wander a bit, at times. <sssss> There are discussions here of everything from Dutch Colonial policy to the habits of spiders to rather technical (though carefully explained) geology. <sssss> While it's all interesting, sometimes it does stray a bit far from the chosen topic. <sssss> The author also occasionally over-reaches, a bit. <sssss> For instance, his assertion that the explosion of the volcano indirectly led to Indonesia's independance is a bit much. <sssss> My edition included a magazine article he'd written just after the Boxing Day tsunami, in which he attempts to connect the San Francisco earthquake with George W. Bush's election as U.S. President...that seems and even bigger stretch, to be honest. <sssss> When the author sticks to the story, however, what he writes is very interesting. <sssss> I would recommend this book
Jon Gerloff		Gilead: Books: Marilynne Robinson,Tim Jerome		1		If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time--don't. <sssss> I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked. <sssss> There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward. <sssss> It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either. <sssss> Do your self a favor and skip it
Speedy Reviewer		In the Shadow of Slavery: African Americans in New York City, 1626-1863 (Historical Studies of Urban America): Books: Leslie M. Harris		1		This book provides a good overview of blacks (slave and free) in New York. <sssss> It's a very good reference (encyclopedic) book. <sssss> My main problem with it is that Leslie M. Harris, the author, relies heavily (if not entirely) on secondary sources. <sssss> The book, then, is nothing more than a patchwork of various other more scholarly works. <sssss> Hence, finding the actual primary source (i.e. <sssss> court decision, council minutes, etc) proves extremely difficult. <sssss> I do not recommend this book for advanced students. <sssss> If, however, you're interested in an easy read and don't care about sources, this is the book for you
Spiros "Spiros"		The Toddlers Busy Book: Books: Trish Kuffner		1		Like everyone of you, I am crazy about my toddler. <sssss> I got this book and the book of Wendy S. Masi' Toddlers Play. <sssss> The comarison: day and night. <sssss> Kuffners book might have 365 activities, but it really bad organized. <sssss> I am a first time parent, so I need some help/guidance; thsi is why I baught this bbok. <sssss> There is nothing to guide me on which activity is for what age group, so I don't know if an activity is for 18 months or 24 or 12 months- ie amI challenging my toddler, am I boring him or amI providing him with the right fun activity for his age??? <sssss> Some of the activities are too obvious- it seems like the author wrote down anything she could think of just to fill in 365 activities in the bookl and there is you see the author's luck of creativity and/or knowledge of the subject. <sssss> Also the descriptiosn are very brief with limited illustrations. <sssss> I really don't understand why anyone will give 5 stars to this book. <sssss> I don't care about the money I spent for the book. <sssss> I care that I ended up with something that I can not really use to provide my toddler with fun. <sssss> For that reason I strongly recommend the othe rbook (Wendy S. Masi's book). <sssss> Yes it has 100 instea dof 365 activities, but it is colorfull, easy and pleasant to read and each activity is marked by an ege indicator. <sssss> Look at the 'look inside' of both these books and you will see what I mean. <sssss> Good luck + have lost of fun with your toddler(s)! <sssss> !
General Breadbasket		Wizard of Oz: Books: L. Frank Baum		2		I was a reasonably big fan of the "Wizard of Oz" when I was a kid. <sssss> I'd seen the Judy Garland film, the "Return to Oz" film, my parents had taken me to a theatre production, and there used to be a cartoon series about Dorothy and her friends that I quite liked. <sssss> Here in Australia, though, you don't see an awful lot of the Wizard of Oz books, and I missed out on all that as a kid. <sssss> I managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story, and I really liked it. <sssss> It's really a shame I couldn't find it earlier. <sssss> Dorothy is a girl who lives with her aunt and her uncle in the countryside of Kansas. <sssss> In the midst of a "cyclone", Dorothy, her dog Toto, and her whole house are swept away to the Land of Oz, a beautiful but strange world full of all sorts of interesting creatures, good and bad witches, and a very famous wizard. <sssss> Dorothy tries to find her way home, and on the way makes many new friends, like the Scarecrow, "Tin Woodsman" and the cowardly lion. <sssss> Will she ever make it home? <sssss> It's rather different to the movie, I found. <sssss> For one, the journey Dorothy and her friends go on takes many days, whereas the in the Judy Garland film it seems to all take place much shorter. <sssss> The magic shoes Dorothy picks up in Oz are silver here, and not ruby red like in the film. <sssss> There are also a lot of other creatures and things in the book, like the queen of the mice, the Hammerheads, and the Dainty China people. <sssss> Though the world of Oz seems pretty big in the film, it feels a lot bigger to me in the book. <sssss> Oz has a nice atmosphere too, I thought. <sssss> It's very cosy and familiar, and kind of evokes a kind of America the way that say C.S. <sssss> Lewis and J.R.R. <sssss> Tolkien evokes a kind of Britain, if that makes any sense. <sssss> North, south, east, west... in Oz's every direction there's a new land to explore. <sssss> You never know who you might meet, or how they'll do things there. <sssss> I quite like how laid back everyone is in Oz. <sssss> The way the Munchkins and the people of the Emerald City speak, for instance. <sssss> I enjoyed finding out things about my favorite characters too, like how the Tinman became made of tin and how the flying monkeys became slave to the wicked witch of the west, which is all described here. <sssss> That reminds me, there is a little bit of fairy tale violence here, but nothing worse than you might find in "Little Red Riding Hood". <sssss> All in all, a great read, I thought. <sssss> Whimsical, colourful and fun. <sssss> I do hope I can get my hands on some of the follow up books. <sssss> Good thing there's amazon
Justin Enjo		The End of Oil: On the Edge of a Perilous New World: Books: Paul Roberts		2		Everyone should follow the advise published on the outside cover of this book..."You live in this world, you use oil, you must read this book.
D. E. Chapin "would-be astrophysicist"		I Don't Want to Talk About It: Overcoming the Secret Legacy of Male Depression: Books: Terrence Real		2		The insights here are simple, straightforward and profound. <sssss> It explains how modern society can sometimes put men into a no-win situation, resulting in a feeling of frustration, impotence, incompetence, and depression. <sssss> The only socially acceptable way to express it is rage (even though rage is vilified, I can tell you that showing hurt, pain and weakness invites scorn, distain and disrespect, even from those who purport to love us). <sssss> By explaining how we get into this trap, it helps us to understand it and thus gives us a chance to find a way out. <sssss> I wish I could give a copy of this book to every man and woman in the world. <sssss> I see so much of it played out every day all around us, and the pain both men and women feel because of it does so much damage. <sssss> Read it before you have a crisis if you can, but if you are already in crisis, make the effort to read this book even if you can't read anything else. <sssss> It might even save your life. <sssss> Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.
Justin Mercer		Stupid White Men ...and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation!: Books: Michael Moore		1		I read this book because my English Professor spoke highly of it. <sssss> I would call it a collection of stupid and hypocritical opinions and ideas. <sssss> So why did your bridge fall down Mr. <sssss> Engineer? <sssss> Oh, I dropped my structural steel class so I could do a course in another language. <sssss> I don't think it's right to criticize something like a college degree if a person doesn't even possess one. <sssss> Actually I think that something like a college degree would be a great start before writing a book like this. <sssss> It might decrease the chances of writing a book as stupid as this one. <sssss> This book insulted my intelligence and I wouldn't even recommend it for a laugh
webwesen		Exit Wounds: Books: J. A. Jance		1		do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book
krebsman		The World of Normal Boys: Books: K. M. Soehnlein		2		In some ways KM Soehnlein's THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS reminded me of the teenage novels of Paul Zindel. <sssss> There is that same depth of feeling along with characters that can break your heart and make you laugh at the same time. <sssss> Zindel wrote specifically for adolescents. <sssss> Soehnlein does not have those restrictions and has written a brutally honest book about homosexual experimentation among post-pubescent boys and its social implications. <sssss> Although the book is written for adults, it speaks on a deep personal level to the adolescent in all of us. <sssss> THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS is the story of a family that falls apart when a tragic accident befalls the youngest child. <sssss> The story is seen through the eyes of the victim's 13-year-old brother as he tries to find something to hold on to while his mother drifts into alcoholism, his father goes nuts, his sister becomes a religious fanatic (and a kleptomaniac) and he finds himself smitten with two boys. <sssss> One is Todd, the athletic and arrogant brother of his girl-pal confidante who lives next door. <sssss> The other is Scott, a boy who deals drugs, cuts school and has an alcoholic father who beats him. <sssss> All the characters are vividly rendered. <sssss> If this were ever turned into a film, the actress who plays the mother would probably win an Oscar just for her final scene in the car. <sssss> This is powerful and emotional writing. <sssss> I found it very moving. <sssss> It's tempting to want to recommend this book to a wide audience, but I am reticent because there are several scenes of furtive and unacknowledged sex between teenage boys that could upset some people. <sssss> But I will never forget this book. <sssss> Five stars
Mary Beth Wright		What Came Before He Shot Her: Books: Elizabeth George		1		Elizabeth George, please come back. <sssss> This book examines in sickening detail the events preceding the murder of our lovely Helen. <sssss> I, for one, don't care. <sssss> I get it. <sssss> We all got it the last time. <sssss> It's been a long time since I have abandoned any book after a few chapters, and this book truly deserves to be put down in every sense. <sssss> Don't buy it
Ping Lim		China Inc.: How the Rise of the Next Superpower Challenges America and the World: Books: Ted C Fishman,Alan Alan		2		For those that are avid readers of journalistic works such as this one, you would absolutely enjoy every moment rummaging through the pages. <sssss> Statistics are provided but never to the point of being too dry and too boring for the readers to read through. <sssss> The writer endeavours to shed lights for us ramifications of China and its muscle power. <sssss> Instead of branding China as a villain, we need to understand that without support from purchasers who are looking for the cheapest bargains, China wouldn't be where it is now. <sssss> Wal-Mart is covered in detail. <sssss> The writer gives us a projection that if car manufacturing industry is heading the same direction of products manufacturing, it's only a matter of time before prices for cars would plummet quite considerably in the future when China has perfected its manufacturing bases just as Japan and South Korea had done before it. <sssss> Then, there's another discussion about the shifting of population from countryside into urban centres where manufacturing bases are located, and how China is able to sustain the supply of cheap labour. <sssss> China's progress isn't simply detrimental to other countries. <sssss> On contrary, it benefits them as well. <sssss> For example, Australia is having a boom right now due to exportation of natural resources to China. <sssss> With increase of living standard in China, Chinese needs more nutritious food. <sssss> As China couldn't provide enough, United States particularly the Middle States are enjoying a boom in supplying food to the Middle Kingdom. <sssss> Then, there are also discussions about other foreign powers keeping United States in check by siding with China, and also the love and hate relationship between USA and China of controlling the currencies so as to keep the interest rates at an attractive rate to facilitate growth in China and so forth. <sssss> Whilst nobody knows for certain the exact figures of information provided (since China has this tendency to manipulate figures since the beginning of time), suffice to say that the book explains how the mechanism works and allowing us to have an insight of how international trade ticks. <sssss> Yes, some reviewers are fastidious and highly critical of figures provided by the writer but ultimately, I think they are missing the points. <sssss> What's crucial from this book is that we need to understand better about China and learning how to work alongside it in order to share the gains it would garner over the years to come. <sssss> Highly recommended
B. E. Puleo "Polilla"		Miss Julia Stands Her Ground: Books: Ann B. Ross,Cynthia Darlow		1		I have enjoyed the Miss Julia books tremendously but this is my least favorite. <sssss> Miss Julia is married to Sam Murdoch. <sssss> Poor guy is sent to find the missing Hazel Marie in one part and is gone for a good deal of the story. <sssss> Miss Julia does not even make a case of those missing hours! <sssss> It is as if the author could really care less. <sssss> There are so many little plots that you feel as if the author had several ideas and just took one and expanded it but left the others to show all the complications in this woman's life. <sssss> There are times when Miss Julia seems to self-centered and the tongue in cheek mood of the other books in this series is really not present here. <sssss> I found her less likable and also less believable. <sssss> She has taken in her husband's mistress ad illegitimate child. <sssss> Now, there is a question about the child's paternity and she is tolerating the whole thing!!!!! <sssss> Perhaps other books in the series would be a better intro for the uninitiated
R. WINN "Life Is Short, but Wide!"		Escape from reason: Books: Francis A Schaeffer		1		This is a well written but ultimately sophomoric disquisition on the concept that if you don't have faith in the supernatural, you have no reason for hope. <sssss> According to this book, the rational world is such an unpleasant place that, if you are not religious as Schaeffer defines religious, "[t]he only way of escape lies in a nonrational fantasy world of experience, drugs, absurdity, pornography, an elusive "final experience," madness... <sssss> ." <sssss> Piffle! <sssss> Throughout history, a great many people found life to be good without resorting to either madness or Schaeffer's brand of religion. <sssss> And indeed, religion and rationality need not be foes, as frequently demonstrated by scientists and science writers, such as Isaac Asimov and Stephen Jay Gould. <sssss> Reduces our choices to "religion or madness" is just silly. <sssss> Schaeffer in this book champions not religion or spirituality, but authoritarianism with a clerical face. <sssss> His fans won't like that characterization, but my job as a reviewer is to tell you what's in the book; if you seek comfort in authoritarian religion, this book's skillful wordcraft makes it is a good place to start
zhorin@hotmail.com		The Secrets of Giron Arnis Escrima (Tuttle Martial Arts): Books: Antonio E. Somera		1		This book is bad for beginner and practically useless for a master. <sssss> There is no comprehensive description of training complexes, footwork drills and other important details, which were completely omitted. <sssss> It gives just an overview of the system in general, so the reader can have some vague feeling of what Giron escrima is
Joanne Hanrahan		Rick Steves' Rome 2003: Books: Rick Steves,Gene Openshaw		1		... and the maps are worthless. <sssss> Two examples of the many glaring inaccuracies contained in this book: 1) Rick claims you can pick up a bus map in any tourist information kiosk. <sssss> The following is an actual transcript of our conversation with the tourist info lady: us: buon giorno. <sssss> do you speak english? <sssss> info lady: of course. <sssss> us: we'd like to go to Vatican city. <sssss> may we have a bus map please? <sssss> info lady: a bus map? <sssss> for Roma? <sssss> us: um, yes. <sssss> info lady: no such thing exists. <sssss> 2) Rick claims you can see everything you want to see in the Vatican in one morning: St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican Museums, the Sistine Chapel - everything. <sssss> Um, Rick? <sssss> Have you ever BEEN there? <sssss> Did you notice the 40,000 other people there all trying to get in to the same things? <sssss> Did you notice the priceless and beautiful works of art on practically every surface? <sssss> Did it occur to you that people might, perhaps, want to stop and admire a large number of them? <sssss> Light a candle? <sssss> Say a prayer? <sssss> Some of us, also, have to behind a crowd of 35 elderly Germans to look at Michaelangelo's Pieta, and everything else. <sssss> Methinks ol' Rick either spends an average of 15 minutes apiece on the most astonishing and pleasurable spots in Rome, or is comfortable elbowing foreign senior citizens in the ribs
Paula L. Cole "triallaw"		S Is for Silence (Kinsey Millhone Mysteries (Audio)): Books: Sue Grafton,Judy Kaye		1		Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. <sssss> Not the case with "S". <sssss> I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand. <sssss> The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all. <sssss> I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. <sssss> The ending wasn't clear either. <sssss> I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. <sssss> Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall. <sssss> I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. <sssss> Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here. <sssss> I would vote pass on this one.
William Nuessle		The Healing Path of Yoga: Time-Honored Wisdom and Scientifically Proven Methods That Alleviate Stress, Open Your Heart, and Enrich Your Life: Books: Nischala Joy Devi,Dean Ornish M.D.,Shaye Areheart		2		This book is about yoga for the heart, which is rare in our body sculpting culture, yet paradoxically heart diseases are one of the greatest risk factors for our modern health. <sssss> A simple, profound gift of yoga is the recognition that the body is the temple for the indwelling spirit. <sssss> Realizing this simple truth profoundly affects our relationship to the body. <sssss> Through the author's lifetime committment to the teachings of yoga, we glimpse the relevance of the yogic lifestyle. <sssss> This book serves as a guide in making healthier choices in everyday life. <sssss> By walking for awhile with Nischala, we touch a deeper realization of the unity that yoga brings. <sssss> I recommend this book to any yoga practitioner, teacher, as well as anyone who seeks greater peace of mind and physical well-being
E. Shepherd		The G-string Murders: Books: Gypsy Rose Lee		1		This book is by far the worst proofed book I've ever read in my life. <sssss> I can't believe I'm writing this as a review, because I can normally overlook a few typos. <sssss> However, the typos in this book make for an almost impossible read. <sssss> I can't believe I paid money for it
BruceWayne		High Roads (High Roads, 1): Books: Scott Lobdell,Leinil Yu		2		How this book flew under the nation's radar---I'll ever know. <sssss> Furthermore it's discouraging as hell because it only goes to prove that great work so often goes unrecognized. <sssss> This book plays out like a Spielberg movie from page one. <sssss> Very Spielbergian because of it's perfect blend of adventure, romance and humor. <sssss> The characters are dynamic and interesting as hell. <sssss> The storyline is straight out of an Indiana Jones serial, and it keeps building until you're reading as fast as you possibly can just to see what happens. <sssss> The art work is astounding. <sssss> These are the coolest-looking heroes, sexiest women, and the most powerful looking baddies I've ever seen penciled in my life. <sssss> It's just a shame that this book isn't getting the buzz that crap like "Ultimate Spider-Man" is getting---because in all reality this is the best graphic novel on the shelves right now---and could easily be the film adaptation that could return Steven Spielberg to greatness. <sssss> For once in a very long time...I'm truly blown away.
Robert Chagal		Day Trade Online (Wiley Audio): Books: Christopher A. Farrell,Jeff Woodman		1		This book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998!!! <sssss> Totally out of date! <sssss> Useless!! <sssss> Wondering why it is still for sale. <sssss> The author, contacted by email responded but did not address the questions asked, simply giving excuses and mentioning that he wrote another book much better than this one... Outrageaous! <sssss> Spread the word and if you own the book, get your money back
A. Barkley "B. Barkley"		Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior: Books: Temple Grandin,Catherine Johnson,Shelly Frasier		1		What a bunch of high school hallway gossip! <sssss> The author does not know the difference between white and albino! <sssss> The 'genetics' discussions on color (which includes people, chickens, horses, and dogs - all of it suspect) and mutts vs. purebred dogs are total claptrap! <sssss> I confess, I couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies.' <sssss> WHAT?? <sssss> A waste of my hard-earned $. <sssss> Having read those parts I cannot believe anything that went before or that follows, not that I'm reading any further. <sssss> How is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print? <sssss> And now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation. <sssss> Publisher, where are your pre-publication reviews? <sssss> Shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published!
D. Morse "adventurer"		Golden Buddha (Wheeler Large Print Book Series): Books: Clive Cussler,Craig Dirgo		1		Unlike Cussler's other series, I found this first story of the "Oregon Files" slow going at first and rather confusing. <sssss> There are just too many things going on (no problem, I suppose, for multi-taskers!) <sssss> and way too many characters to keep track of. <sssss> Also, there's little to no character development even of "Mr. Chairman", Juan Cabrillo. <sssss> The fact that he and his companions are mercenaries (with a penchant for good deeds that pay well) doesn't compare favorably with the NUMA heroes. <sssss> However, the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides I expect from Mr. Cussler and co-writers. <sssss> I look forward to the subsequent Oregon Files with high hopes.
R. Johns		The Hunting of the President: The Ten-Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton: Books: Joe Conason,Gene Lyons		1		And you shouldn't inhale. <sssss> Several reviewers have ecstatically proclaimed this book and movie to be an eye-opening, truth-revealing work, but those who are credulous enough to think they learn history through agenda-focused books and films like "Hunting" need to go back and see other "documentaries" like "Triumph Of The Will", "The Eternal Jew" or "Reefer Madness". <sssss> Let's be honest, people. <sssss> This book was written by a strongly pro-Clinton columnist and the movie was produced by well-known FOB (Friend Of Bill) Harry Thompson. <sssss> It's about as objective as the factually challenged "Fahrenheit 9/11", a work that Moore himself now calls "satire". <sssss> (By the way, I'll bet you didn't know that many Middle Easterners who have seen Moore's movie are outraged at the shallow, stereotypical and racist image he presented of their people and culture.) <sssss> The point is, whether intentional or just laziness these dime-a-dozen political books typically contain significant misrepresentations. <sssss> If you're already a member of the author's congregation, you won't care. <sssss> You'll shout "hallelujah!" <sssss> and say that "Hunting" has given the world Great Truths. <sssss> But clear thinkers understand that it's foolish to uncritically accept the representations in either this book or the followup movie.
Bai_ying_ni		The Year of Magical Thinking: Books: Joan Didion,Barbara Caruso		1		I find some parts of Didion's book very relatable, at least when she's exploring her feelings of shock, the superstitious feelings, and the obsessive re-living of her husband's last few days and death. <sssss> But these sections become less and less frequent as the book continues, and it all seems to devolve. <sssss> But pertaining to the audiobook: What is with the music they insist on playing in the "background" at the end of sections? <sssss> The first time it came on, I took out my earphones to see if someone in my office was inexplicably blaring piano solos. <sssss> It's weird and invasive and distracts from the reading
Bookseller		How to Start and Operate Your Own Bed-and-Breakfast: Down-To-Earth Advice from an Award-Winning B pppppppppp B Owner: Books: Martha W. Murphy,Amelia R. Seton		2		Going into the business, I bought this book and found it very helpful. <sssss> This one as well as "I'm Living Your Dream Life" by Michele Cozzens are well worth the money
MJM		Toilet Training in Less Than A Day: Books: Nathan Azrin		1		First off, I have not read this book myself, so disreguard this review if you want. <sssss> I'm reviewing it because based on the reviews and what I can tell here, and from descriptions from my own mother, I believe this is the book she used in a failed attempt to potty-train me. <sssss> I am 99% sure, but she does not remember the title so I can't be 100% sure. <sssss> My mother described a system where she devoted one day to nothing but potty-training. <sssss> She got everyone else out of the house, and removed all my toys from eyesight. <sssss> Then she went through a detailed explanation using a potty doll and had me try to explain it back, using the doll. <sssss> She then showed me what looked like a whole kitchen full of little toys and candy, and told me I would get rewarded for using the potty that day. <sssss> I remember all that part. <sssss> After that she said that we went through a process where she had to scold me for accidents and we did nothing but try to go potty all day. <sssss> I was definately old enough to be doing this, because I actually remember it. <sssss> (I am 25 now, so if this book was published in the late 70s or early 80s, I'm being accurate.) <sssss> Now, let me tell you the results. <sssss> I don't remember how I felt that day, but I do know that it started something that became a huge emotional battle for me. <sssss> I was a very sensitive child, and I am a very sensitive adult. <sssss> What mom and I remember was that potty-training became a war in our home- and it took YEARS. <sssss> Because of my sensitivities and my mother's poor choice in training methods, I began holding my bowel movements. <sssss> (I was able urinate in the potty at a normal age, not sure when.) <sssss> I would hold bowel movements whenever I had the urge to go, even if she put me back in a diaper. <sssss> I held for weeks at times, and sometimes this required a lot of pain for me (obviously). <sssss> When it finally got to the point that I couldn't hold it anymore, the BM was so big that I needed physical help to go. <sssss> Sometimes it would get so bad that the opposite result would happen- I'd have a sudden diarheaa because the muscles were fatigued. <sssss> This went on for years, and the doctors kept telling mom that I'd eventually outgrow it. <sssss> She tried suppositories, oil, fiber, and even started giving me adult doses of laxatives. <sssss> Finally, when I was 5 (two years into this), Mom made a tape recording of me SCREAMING while trying to go to the bathroom. <sssss> A doctor took pity on us and prescribed enemas. <sssss> I used them on and off for two more years. <sssss> I was finally fully potty trained- AT SEVEN. <sssss> I am now 25, and occasionally I still notice some health problems that may be attributable to this. <sssss> Now, obviously there is no way I can fully explain why all that happened, and I certainly can not blame all of that on the book. <sssss> I was a very sensitive kid, and my mom picked a bad time to do it too (I had just had a baby brother). <sssss> But I just want to describe the danger of using a insensitive method. <sssss> And I'm not just talking about the pain I went through there- if we're to believe Freudian theories about the anal stage of childhood- well, let's just say I could be his poster child. <sssss> I am now potty-teaching my own highly sensitive daughter, who will be 3 in a week. <sssss> We have been working on this (no specific methods, just lots of sitting on the potty) for over a year now, and with NO results. <sssss> But I'm not in a hurry, and thats because she's not ready, and we need to do this on her timetable, not mine
jeffsdate "jeffsdate"		The World's Best-Kept Diet Secrets: Lose Weight Quickly, Safely and Permanently: Books: Diane Irons		1		I agree with the reader(s) who said this book totally contradicts itself and seems thrown-together, as if no one proofread it. <sssss> In one chapter she'll recommend something; then later on she'll tell you it's ineffective and/or dangerous! <sssss> She gives a long, long list of herbal supplements that are supposed to aid weight loss -- but she just repeats all the advertisers' claims without any comments, recommendations or opinions of her own. <sssss> Personally I think most natural/ herbal supplements are a ripoff, but if she had given any testimonials by people who've found them to work, I might consider trying them. <sssss> On the whole, this book is a waste of money
Andrew Claudius Finchlittle		Wild Child: Life With Jim Morrison: Books: Linda Ashcroft		1		Oh.... my.... <sssss> God!!!! <sssss> There is another Patricia Kennealy running mad through the streets and shouting about high schoolish love fantasies that exist only in her mind. <sssss> I thought one Patricia was enough. <sssss> But after reading this book, I am faced with the frightening realization that there are TWO of them! <sssss> Also, what I find very disturbing is that this version of Patricia may be even daffier than the original version. <sssss> After reading just 6 or 7 pages of this hallucination horror show it was evident to me that the author is suffering from a case of Patriciaitis and a dose of Kennealyism. <sssss> By the 40th page I was searching for my red slippers so I could click them together and get back to Kansas. <sssss> Or anywhere else, as long as my copy of this book didn't make the trip with me. <sssss> A pack of lies and a waste of paper and time. <sssss> I would rather read Mary Poppins than wade through this endless journey of rubble.
"jrolfe"		The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941-1945: Books: David S. Wyman		1		This is a highly influential book. <sssss> Roosevelt has had many enemies growing out of his presidency. <sssss> No one has had the same negative impact on Roosevelt's name to equal Wyman's attack. <sssss> But, although Wyman, a professional historian has well-documented his research, much of the indictment of the Roosevelt Administration is based upon conjecture incapable of proof. <sssss> The litmus test of his proposals was the bombing of Auschwitz. <sssss> He asserts that the failure to bomb was due to a lack of caring. <sssss> Thousands of Jews could have been saved. <sssss> But there is no way to prove this. <sssss> Many Jews could also have died because bombing was inaccurate and Jewish prisoners lived close to the crematoria. <sssss> Too much in his charges is based on too little evidence. <sssss> Peter Novick in his book, The Holocaust in American Life, calls Wyman's thesis a pppppppppp quot;comfortable morality tale pppppppppp quot; and pppppppppp quot;bad history. <sssss> pppppppppp quot; In addition to Novick, Henry L. Feingold, Frank W. Brecher, and William Rubinstein have written critically about Wyman
L. Sidhu		To the Last Man: A Novel of the First World War: Books: Jeff Shaara		1		This is the first book by Shaara I have read. <sssss> And, if his other works are like this, it is also the last. <sssss> On the cover, J. Persico is quoted as saying Shaara makes "literature read like history and history read like literature." <sssss> He goes on to claim that Shaara brings the war to "pulsating life." <sssss> I have even read a review that claimed this book was better than Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front. <sssss> I must have been reading a different book. <sssss> The first chapter, The Replacement, is a great short story. <sssss> After reading it, I had hight expectations for the book. <sssss> Unfortunately, it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view. <sssss> And, the history reads like an 8th grade textbook. <sssss> His narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived. <sssss> They are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them. <sssss> After the dislocated short story of the first chapter, the book delves into a long-winded story of the flying aces, interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story. <sssss> It frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book. <sssss> Shaara doesn't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918's, when the Americans arrive, focusing, as I noted before, primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war. <sssss> I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own. <sssss> Here, however, it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story. <sssss> Or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the British or French perspective. <sssss> And, I have no particularly problem with him focusing on the American perspective on the war, but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry? <sssss> I suppose a smaller book doesn't sell as well. <sssss> For those interested in historical fiction, I would recommend Bernard Cornwall's work. <sssss> And, perhaps, Shaara can learn a bit from him
Martin Asiner		War and Peace (Penguin Classics): Books: Leo Tolstoy,Rosemary Edmonds		2		Reading WAR AND PEACE is an immense undertaking, which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human. <sssss> The first time that I read it, I read it as a novel, for entertainment. <sssss> Years later, I picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious. <sssss> I sought to know how Tolstoy could justify the ways of God to man. <sssss> During this second reading, I was able to examine the Russian names, characters, events, and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through. <sssss> What I saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding Epilog, which I scanted then but studied now. <sssss> Most readers of WAR AND PEACE find this part heavy going, which it certainly is, but in it, Tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do. <sssss> In essence, each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space, with one atom colliding at random with another, but when a sufficient number act in concert, such as Napoleon's invasion of Russia, their force is irresistable. <sssss> When Tolstoy introduces world leaders like Napoleon or the Tsar, he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom, who can not see the Big Picture any more clearly than anyone else can. <sssss> The tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change. <sssss> But when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self-deluding--as when General Kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms, then they are drawing closer to a universal "one" with nature. <sssss> This "one" Tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with God. <sssss> Tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that "one" or any other deity, but he does say that history, time, and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path, and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go, then he might wish to emulate General Kutuzov, who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going.
Lisa		Destructive Emotions: A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama: Books: Daniel Goleman		1		A friend going through the same problems as I am was strongly recommended this book by her therapist and she bought it for me, as well. <sssss> I was enthusiastic to read it and at least understand these emotions. <sssss> If I could actually use the information to help myself, all the better. <sssss> I was warned that the beginning was a bit slow and hard to get through, so I struggled through it, expecting it to get easier to read. <sssss> It didn't. <sssss> It's been sitting by my bed for months with the bookmark at page 104 and I'm really sorry because I'm sure that the contents are useful and interesting, but I just can't get past that page 104. <sssss> I normally refuse to leave a book half unread, but this just has to be an exception because every time I pick it up I fall asleep within 3 or 4 pages. <sssss> I agree with some of the previous reviewers that there is way too much emphasis on the actual workings of the meetings. <sssss> I feel like I'm watching a video of it, as every minimal thing is described in incredible detail. <sssss> But I wanted to read this book to understand the views and conclusions of the group, not to become an expert on the tea breaks they had. <sssss> Also, I felt lost as the scientific tests they had previously carried out were explained in such detail, I ended up having to skim over some sections. <sssss> This may be a great resource for those who have great patience and/or a scientific background, but too much for a regular Joe like me
Frank Muldoon "fjm274"		loyalty.com : Customer Relationship Management in the New Era of Internet Marketing: Books: Frederick Newell		1		The book is chock full of examples and anecdotes but really has no new worthwhile conceptualizations or insights to make it worth reading. <sssss> If you don't know anything about database marketing, then you will get something out of this book. <sssss> If you are familiar with the basic concepts of customer database analysis, loyalty programs and relationship marketing, there is nothing new here. <sssss> In fact a much better introduction to all those concepts is The Loyalty Effect by Reichenheld or Customer Connections by Wayland and Cole. <sssss> The subtitle mentions the dot com world, but the book has little to say about the Internet. <sssss> The book really does not cover CRMs (as oppsed to database marketing) in that it fails describe how CRM systems work and what database, modeling and communications platforms are required to implement them
Mary		Good Old Boy: A Delta Boyhood: Books: Willie Morris		2		I am from Yazoo City so this book has always been one of my favorites. <sssss> I saw Willie Morris at a car wash in Jackson, MS not long before his death. <sssss> I was shy and didn't want to bother him, so I didn't introduce myself and have a chat. <sssss> I would have loved to have spoken with him. <sssss> Now I regret my shyness - should've taken the chance. <sssss> Yazoo City has an enduring quality and charm that shows in all his books and stories. <sssss> No matter where I live, it will always be home. <sssss> There is a great feeling of safety and warmth whenever I drive into the city limits. <sssss> It is a feeling of home. <sssss> Not many people have that sense of home these days. <sssss> I feel blessed to have grown up there
tmfbookster "readit33"		Terrier (Beka Cooper): Books: Tamora Pierce		2		Terrier will not disappoint Tamora Pierce fans! <sssss> The narration is done through first person, told as a journal. <sssss> This is particularily challenging for authors to do well as it is easy to loose the flow of the story, and difficult to account for actions the narrator hasn't seen. <sssss> But Tamora has performed her usual magic, snatching up the readers' interest from the first page and holding it until the last (I even read all of the notes pages and the bio). <sssss> Readers may find it difficult to put down. <sssss> Once again it will be hard to wait for the next boo
cocojosie		Fictions (Penguin Modern Classics): Books: Jorge Luis Borges,Andrew Hurley		1		My introduction to Borges was through the collection Labyrinths. <sssss> I immediately fell in love with the stories, the prose, the poetry, and so went on to buy this complete volume. <sssss> While it is nice to have all Borges's stories in one place, and at a reasonable price, the language doesn't really hold up for me. <sssss> The translation is... well, not sloppy, but too simple, like those childrens' versions of classic novels they pressed on you in 5th grade. <sssss> I have nothing against Andrew Hurley, but his translation of Borges leaves me cold. <sssss> I'd give Borges 5 stars out of 5, but Hurley? <sssss> No more than 2.
Christina M. Westover "CMW"		Liberty Falling (Anna Pigeon Mysteries (Paperback)): Books: Nevada Barr		1		After reading Deep South and Flashback, I was looking forward to going back and reading some of the earlier Anna Pigeon books. <sssss> Liberty Falling has to be the worst of the Pigeon series. <sssss> I found myself skimming over pages and skipping over the last third of the book to get to the end and hope the ending would make it worth the read. <sssss> It wasn't.
Trey Ivins		A Guide to the Star Wars Universe: Books: Bill Slavicsek		2		This book has everything from the SSD Executor,to the ISD Avenger,to the Emperor's resurrection.This book is the one you need if you are looking for information on people,planets,starships,fighters,space colonies,EVERYTHING!! <sssss> !This book is da bomb wit a capital b
C. Ryono "constantly looking for more finds"		Found II: More of the Best Lost, Tossed, and Forgotten Items from Around the World: Books: Davy Rothbart		2		For those of you who might find the first Found book or this second one offensive in its content -- guess what? <sssss> -- life is offensive. <sssss> And for that matter, life is also often tragic, poignant, ironic, hysterically funny, random, and sometimes all of these things at once... the "Found" books and the magazines reflect all of these aspects of everyday life. <sssss> That's what makes it so remarkable. <sssss> Indeed, how many books can cause you to giggle and feel emotionally vulnerable within two pages? <sssss> This work by Davy Rothbart, co-editor Jason Bitner, and all the Found crew deserves praise because this is a cross-section of humanity stripped down to its beautiful bare essentials. <sssss> If, several thousand years from now, (android? <sssss> zombie?) <sssss> archeologists study our current century, they might go through our trash. <sssss> Think of "Found" as giving them a headstart.
Joanie		The Dance of Deception: A Guide to Authenticity and Truth-Telling in Women's Relationships: Books: Harriet Lerner		2		I think this is Harriet Lerner's best book. <sssss> I has the clearest and most helpful chapter on family secrets that I've ever read. <sssss> The chapter called pppppppppp quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Orifice pppppppppp quot; is worth the price of the book. <sssss> The chapter on affairs, even though controversial, should be helpful to all couples, especially if you think your partner will never cheat on you
mswoon		What Went Wrong at Enron: Everyone's Guide to the Largest Bankruptcy in U.S. History: Books: Peter C. Fusaro,Ross M. Miller		1		I don't get the impression from reading the book that the authors have even tried to analyzed the financial holdings that was set up. <sssss> It is the thinnest book on Enron that I read, for very good reason.
BlondieGirl35 "Meredith"		Benjamin Franklin: Books: Edmund S. Morgan		2		I enjoyed this book. <sssss> It focuses mainly on Franklin's time abroad in England and France and gives an overview on who Franklin was and how he interacted on the world stage during the revolutionary period. <sssss> I believe it's very accessible and would be a good starting place for anyone interested in Franklin's life. <sssss> He's funny
L. Myers		Dear John: Books: Nicholas Sparks		1		I've always been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and I couldn't wait to read Dear John. <sssss> Well, there was no reason to rush. <sssss> It starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. <sssss> The main girl character is annoying and you hope that John will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book. <sssss> I cannot wait for another Nicholas Sparks book, but only because I want to know that he hasn't lost his touch, and that this novel was just a fluck
Coole		You're Hired: How to Succeed in Business and Life from the Winner of The Apprentice: Books: Bill Rancic		1		Bill is very boring typically talks about business tips you already know. <sssss> The show was much better, you should buy that. <sssss> Kwame is much smater and deserved the job. <sssss> I can tell that this book is another promotional tool. <sssss> Don't waste even a cent on this book
Ron D		Cape Light: Books: Thomas Kinkade,Katherine Spencer		1		Yet another offering from the Kinkade art product assembly line. <sssss> Pass on this -- Read real books and buy real art instead
Matthew Cappabianca		What Art Is: The Esthetic Theory of Ayn Rand: Books: Louis Torres,Michelle Marder Kamhi		2		This book is the best book on Rand's esthetics I've ever read; in fact, it is the only book on the topic that I know of. <sssss> It is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical; they are not slavish cultists savoring every last word written by Rand. <sssss> They approach the material with critical distance and do an excellent job of placing Rand's work in the larger history of esthetic theory. <sssss> They demolish abstract art, and devote considerable energy to discussing Rand's definition of art. <sssss> They even propose their own individual alternatives! <sssss> If anything shows independence, it is this willingness to debate the differences between the authors of the same work! <sssss> Remarkable! <sssss> The world of Rand commentary is filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship. <sssss> That is clear just by reading one of the reviews here, by people who are devotees of certain pppppppppp quot;scholars pppppppppp quot; who do nothing but repeat the catechism. <sssss> They take swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published; that is why they hate this book. <sssss> Because it is independent-minded. <sssss> Judge for yourself. <sssss> Don't be fooled
Grady Harp		Wide Angle: National Geographic Greatest Places: Books: Ferdinand Protzman		2		National Geographic Magazine has long been recognized for the quality of its color photographs by its brilliant staff of photographers who manage to go to places both known and unknown and open vistas of other cultures, other peoples, other landscapes. <sssss> In this very large and exceptionally affordable volume are some of NG's finest images plus many dazzling photographs not previously published in the magazine. <sssss> The result is a panorama of the world as few other books can supply. <sssss> Covering nearly all the countries of the world, WIDE ANGLE uses its descriptor to unfold some remarkable images of fields and terrain and the peoples who inhabit them, all composed beautifully with NGs typical 'hidden camera' technique. <sssss> This is a travel volume for those who plan to visit the out of the ordinary places as well as a scrapbook for those who have been to the more accessible places, but is it more: this is a closer look at the planet we inhabit that is so magnificent it urges us by images alone to protect the beauty we threaten to destroy. <sssss> Recommended. <sssss> Grady Harp, January 06
DancesWithAnxiety "chewtoy to the Fates"		Jihad Vs.McWorld: Books: Benjamin R. Barber		1		In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. <sssss> These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, "cultural," religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. <sssss> On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace. <sssss> Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ("Jihad" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ("McWorld" is Barber's label for this). <sssss> That's the book. <sssss> This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. <sssss> Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book's insights novel or pointed. <sssss> If you're new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. <sssss> It will catch you up on a few useful truisms. <sssss> As others have pointed out, the "terrorism's challenge to democracy" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn't accurately reflect the book's content. <sssss> "Jihad" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book's many examples of parochialism
Ricardo Le?n "Ricardo Le?n"		The Art of Speed Reading People: How to Size People Up and Speak Their Language: Books: Paul D. Tieger,Barbara Barron-Tieger		2		This book has changed my life. <sssss> It is amazing how much I learned about myself. <sssss> Now I understand my wife and other people, and I don't judge them anymore. <sssss> My relations to others is now easear and less stressfull. <sssss> Thanks
Joel Magnussen		Shattering The' Left Behind' Delusion: Books: John Noe		1		Steer clear of this one - criticizing others for lack of original thought or a consistent viewpoint, while virtually copying their cover (not to mention riding the wave of their unique concept) illustrates the weak and timid position assumed by this author. <sssss> Please achieve your own significance, not bashing others popular and widely accepted readership. <sssss> As Christians, we are obviously aware of varying theories on end-times. <sssss> To even slightly indicate we are not aware indicates the authors pompous platform. <sssss> So sad his approach couldn't be based on his own original work
Vicki J. Caparulo, CCP		Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America: 2-Volume Set: Books: Andrew F. Smith		2		I sit here with my two newly acquired volumes of the Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America in absolute awe! <sssss> With almost 200 contributors, almost 800 entries and nearly 400 illustrations, editor Andy Smith and Oxford University Press have done a magnificent job of putting together what is clearly the most comprehensive work on this immensely broad subject ever undertaken. <sssss> Whether you are a food professional or interested amateur, a historian, sociologist or anthropologist, a student or scholar, these volumes will no doubt become your most important resource for information related in any way to the history of food and drink in America. <sssss> The scope is astounding, spanning some five centuries and ranging from events and trends to products, from ethnic, religions and cultural influences to political and social movements in American history, and also includes dozens of biographical entries of important contributors and influences on the development of culinary life and gastronomy in America. <sssss> Despite the enormity of this work, it is refreshingly approachable, set forth alphabetically, written in clear language, translated when needed, and annotated and supplemented with bibliographical information for those wishing to explore further. <sssss> As a food professional-recipe developer, food writer and culinary educator-there is no doubt in my mind that these pages will soon be worn and this seminal work will remain among my most valued and cherished resources for as long as my interest in food and gastronomy is alive.
Gavin Curtis		The Hidden Records: Humanity's Biggest Secret Encrypted in the Da Vinci Codex (color illustrated): Books: Wayne Herschel,Birgitt Lederer		2		By far a very thorough and intelligent read. <sssss> I could not put it down. <sssss> The evidence that pyramids all over earth from a lost epoch of man align to specific star clusters is overwhelming in my opinion. <sssss> Doesn't take a PhD to realize that if something looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck.... chances are it's a duck. <sssss> Everthing is presented via full color images and in an easy to comprehend format. <sssss> It has changed my perspective and at the same time answered many questions for me personally; and of course will raise many more! <sssss> An absolute must read
Robert Cyr		Authentic Happiness : Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment: Books: Martin Seligman		1		Early on the author tells how he proved to concept of "learned helplessness" through his experiments where he administered electric shocks on caged dogs until they gave up and just lay there and whimpered. <sssss> I threw the book away at that point. <sssss> This "scientist" shouldn't be rewarded for his senseless cruelty that proves nothing. <sssss> We don't support your science, Herr Doctor Seligman! <sssss> Get the book from a library if you must, but don't reward him for his "experiments." <sssss> It could have been your dog this moral idiot experimented on
Taylor Bayard "Armchair Special Agent"		Cross Bones: Books: Kathy Reichs		1		Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. <sssss> Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. <sssss> In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. <sssss> Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. <sssss> Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong
Jennifer		One Door Away From Heaven (Dean Koontz): Books: Dean Koontz,Anne Twomey		1		This is truly a disappointing book. <sssss> It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot. <sssss> Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists. <sssss> The Leilani character is patently ridiculous. <sssss> She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable. <sssss> I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot. <sssss> Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception. <sssss> Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults. <sssss> Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger. <sssss> In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety. <sssss> I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field. <sssss> Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue. <sssss> That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow. <sssss> The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works. <sssss> It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree. <sssss> His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs). <sssss> This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings. <sssss> Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one. <sssss> Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts
Travis A. Pelt "Freelance Guru"		The Ice Dragon: Books: George R. R. Martin		1		I hold Martin's Song of Ice and Frie series in high regard; the man is a talented writer. <sssss> For adults. <sssss> The problem with this book is that it reads exactly like whay you'd expect a chlidren's book written by George R.R.Martin to read like. <sssss> By this I mean violent imagery and the occasional immolation of soon-to-be-dearly-departed-uncles. <sssss> (And as an uncle I object to this wanton anti-uncle setiment running rampant in children's literature!!!) <sssss> There seems to be no age group for this book. <sssss> The story isn't that engrossing, and a kid I'd feel comfortable buying a book for containing this level of violence would most likely want something more substanial. <sssss> Though for adults I strongly recommend Martin's other books over Mr. Pratchett, when it comes to books for kids about this age level I've gotta go with Pratchett's Wee Freemen over this. <sssss> Or, for slightly younger kids, The Persistent Gappers of Firth. <sssss> Hell, eveybody loves the Gappers of Firth.
Midwest Book Review		And the Sea Is Never Full: Memoirs, 1969-: Books: Elie Wiesel		2		Elie Wiesel's And The Sea Is Never Full provides the concluding volume of memoirs, relating his meetings with world leaders, his travels, and his diplomatic adventures. <sssss> Familiarity with Wiesel's importance and his prior memoirs will lend a special appreciation for this concluding volume
Hannah M. Hurey		Answered Prayers (Danielle Steel): Books: Danielle Steel,Ron Mclarty		1		Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me. <sssss> When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon. <sssss> The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded. <sssss> Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem. <sssss> The plot was good, but moved slowly. <sssss> I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much. <sssss> I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store. <sssss> I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it
Andrew D. Wanros "Historian"		The Rising Tide: A Novel of World War II (Random House Large Print): Books: Jeff Shaara		2		Jeff Shaara never ceases to amaze. <sssss> I have absolutely loved everyone of his (and his fathers)books. <sssss> I have been waiting awhile for him to delve into World War 2. and he did not disappoint me. <sssss> First things first, I COULD NOT put this book down. <sssss> Everything about it was phenomenal. <sssss> Icant explain it in any other way. <sssss> Please read this book. <sssss> Even if you dont like books like this it is well worth your time
El Lagarto		Darkness Visible (Random House Large Print): Books: William Styron		1		I had high hopes when I picked up this book because Styron is a terrific writer and I was interested in the subject. <sssss> By the time I was done I nearly threw it across the room. <sssss> Admittedly, Depression makes for a tough topic, but that's not good enough. <sssss> There's more to Depression than staring at an empty page, unable to muster the courage to write one single word. <sssss> The dark places of the soul also have their fires, their drama, even if they are played out in secret. <sssss> I will grant that the writing is spare and elegant, as you would expect. <sssss> But I would have traded all the insider literati name-dropping for one paragraph that gave me a visceral sense of how he felt, something that put me there with him. <sssss> I have read instruction manuals for appliances with more passion and conviction. <sssss> Styron is candid about his descent into alcoholism, but the self-destruction inherent in alcoholism does not imply the elimination of ego, frequently it heralds the triumph of ego. <sssss> In Darkness Visible, Styron maintains egomaniacal control of his subject through aloof detachment, showcasing a carefully polished veneer, never inviting the reader in.
Andrew Coyle		Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison: Books: Michel Foucault		2		Reviewers are right about this book tracing the origins of the modern surveillance state back to the birth of the modern prison system but they are not mentioning the prime motive for this that Foucault points to: profit and capitalism. <sssss> With the rise of industrial society it was more important to regiment and discipline the masses than 'off with their head' or hands. <sssss> The panopticon prison idea was taken to the factory and service industry by industial giants like Carnegie and Rockefeller and the fruits of this profitable perversion can be seen all over society today: delivery drivers monitored throughout the day by GPS, social security cards, public schooling (founded by the same industrial giants) intellectual and psychological grading, job placement and conformity, credit ratings, licences needed to do everything but go to the bathroom, a growing snitch culture...Foucault's major thesis is that surveillance (discipline) aids profit and any deviation from profit leads to state-sanctioned punishment in the form of increased surveillance. <sssss> As industry and profits increase so will the surveillance and discipline that make it run smoothly. <sssss> Every facet of modern society works to this end. <sssss> The irony is, as techno-pundits like McCluhan later pointed out, in the modern world the prisoner with a tv set has as much denatured freedom as the tycoon in his guarded estate and they enjoy a lot of the same things in a world where pleasure is increasingly programmed and vicarious; in a world that has turned from the moral order to the profit order, where bad credit today is the profit order version of the ancient moral order idea of excommunication. <sssss> Everything that stands in the way of the profit order, whether it be an idea, person, religion, or country is attacked. <sssss> Bottom line, we are all 'human resources' in the political economy, in the religion of capital: packaged and packed like a bunch of sardines with the capitalist state and its laws protecting the tabernacle of profit over all else. <sssss> The inanity and inherent fraud of our system, not to mention the explosion of prison populations and an insane consumer society, makes a lot more sense after being traced by a renegade like Foucault. <sssss> Of all his books this is also the easiest read. <sssss> This is a beautiful book by a complicated man. <sssss> by the way, he taught at the University of Buffalo for a short time.
Scott Burmann "Scotty B"		The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red: Books: Ellen Rimbauer,Joyce Reardon,Stephen King		1		I would not personally recommend this book to horror/thriller fans. <sssss> I would definitely not recommend this book for anyone under 18! <sssss> If you like soap operas, you may enjoy this book a lot. <sssss> If you are searching for the secrets of Rose Red or a good ghost story, this is not your book. <sssss> I read the story before the author was made known. <sssss> I thought it might be Stephen King or Tabitha King. <sssss> The writing style was far below Stephen King's style and it was very erotic, which I suspected Tabitha King to be the author. <sssss> However, the accounts of Ellen were obviously written by a man, as the erotic episodes were definitely not from the viewpoint of a woman. <sssss> So, it was no surprise when the author was neither Stephen nor Tabitha, but a male author I have never heard of. <sssss> The book reveals almost nothing new about Rose Red and it's secrets. <sssss> I would dare say that 90% of the diary goes on and on about Ellen and John's wealth and extremely dysfunctional marriage. <sssss> On and on about John's extramarital affairs, Ellen's withholding of sexual favors, more affairs, more withholding of favors, more affairs, more favors withheld. <sssss> The story is a vicious circle regarding this. <sssss> It's almost like she gets burned, but yet continues to play with fire. <sssss> Very frustrating and almost boring, as you read the same scenarios redundantly. <sssss> By the third time, you know exactly what he's doing and how she will retaliate. <sssss> Silly. <sssss> I mentioned above that the Diary of Ellem Rimbauer revealed no new secrets of the house. <sssss> In fact, as the diary progresses, it skips four occurrences (it made mention of the four, like "by the way, four disappearances happened since last time I wrote, but I won't tell you about them"). <sssss> And this I found obnoxious - ***SPOILER ALERT*** Ellen waits some three or so years for a sance from a master uber-psychic. <sssss> Three long years. <sssss> But after the sance, nothing is revealed! <sssss> The book is riddled with episodes like this. <sssss> Some big secret is coming. <sssss> When it finally is revealed, it's no secret at all. <sssss> It's something dumb, like "yes, there are spirits in the house". <sssss> What spirits? <sssss> Why? <sssss> Who? <sssss> Nothing is ever satisfactorily explained. <sssss> I would have given it one star, however it seemed to have a single quality. <sssss> At the start of the diary, Ellen was an ordinary 19 year old fiance to John. <sssss> Soon, she is corrupted by John, wealth, maybe corrupted by her African best friend (jury is still out), and hatred. <sssss> She prays to God, but also to "her other god" (the dark one). <sssss> At first, you suppose she is playing with fire. <sssss> Right on. <sssss> She gets consumed by darkness, revenge, and hatred and falls into self destruction. <sssss> Overall, I personally thought it read like fan fiction. <sssss> I would bet the author whipped up this short story just for giggles, but somehow it got published. <sssss> I was disappointed, hoping for a good ghost story. <sssss> But I ended up reading a soft-porn, soap opera style plot. <sssss> Hope I don't offend those who loved the book :
S. Whiteside		The Collectors: Books: David Baldacci		2		Even though you know before you start reading that this book will have a happy ending, it is a fun read. <sssss> A well written and pleasant book. <sssss> One of the best of this falls crop. <sssss> I am already waiting for the next book in the series
M. Collier		Interlude in Death (In Death): Books: J.D. Robb,Susan Ericksen		2		I love this series. <sssss> I have every one of the books in this series and will never let them go.
L. Knowles		The Pleasures of God: Meditations on God's Delight in Being God: Books: John Piper		2		I first saw this book reviewed in the early 1990's. <sssss> It aroused a double response of curiosity and suspicion. <sssss> Like many a cynic I asked myself, "Now who's this guy and what's he spinning?" <sssss> Against my natural inclination to dismiss it, I ordered POG. <sssss> On receiving it I began reading and found my suspicions confirmed: here was another triumphal and insensitive adherent to the doctrine of the sovereignty of God. <sssss> Strangely, however, I couldn't stop reading. <sssss> Despite months of scrawling angry counter-arguments in the margins of its pages I was drawn inexplicably to the sensibility of its core premise about God's delight in being God. <sssss> To make this story short, I found myself, in the end, exhausted but surrendered to the portrait of God that Piper paints with the full palette of scriptural truth. <sssss> And finally happy too, with the beginnings of the joy Piper wished for his sons in the Foreword. <sssss> Salvation history testifies to the fact that a distinguishing evidence of the truth is that it is often hated - at first. <sssss> The fact that POG eventually had such an unnatural (or supernatural) effect on someone like me - initially so inclined to resist and rebuff - speaks more to the validity of this book than if I had joined immediately in the chorus of deserved admiration. <sssss> This is not a critical analysis of POG; others have provided that sufficiently on this page. <sssss> Instead it's a personal account of the Irresistible Grace that against all nature drew a small and scoffing soul into undeserved open spaces where God's glory was seen...and is now sung.
Diane K. Danielson "CEO, DowntownWomensClub.com"		Strategic planning for community development (Community development series): Books: David L Darling		2		Based on 20 pages of an unfinished Charlotte Bronte manuscript, you forget that it was written in 2004 and are quickly enjoying what feels like a long lost Bronte! <sssss> Ms. Boylan takes into consideration Charlotte's growing concern (at the time of her death) with children born into extreme poverty and deprivation. <sssss> The plot involves a search for the true roots of an orphan (Emma) and introduces the readers as well as her main characters to London's back streets. <sssss> Of course there are all the undying and unfulfilled loves as well as the unlikely coincidences that make for a great period novel
Celtic Historian		The Gifts of the Jews: How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels (Hinges of History): Books: Thomas Cahill		1		Mr. Cahills book offers an interesting and controversial take on history. <sssss> He is an excellent and compelling writer, but his differentiation between pre and post diaspora Israelites when discussing the Celts in several of his books is not always clear. <sssss> It was only the post-Babylonian diaspora Southern Kingdom Israelites who came to be known as Jews, around 500 BC. <sssss> It was the post-Assyrian diaspora (721 BC) of the larger ten-tribed Northern Kingdom Israelites who became what we today call the Celts. <sssss> It is they who are both the Island Celts who populated Ireland, Scotland, Wales, etc., and their cousins, the Continental Celts who sacked the Roman Empire under many Celtic tribal names and who make up most of northwest Europe today. <sssss> The author could perhaps clarify this part of his presentations on European history by reviewing losttribes.net or any other modern Celtic site based on contemporary archeology.
Victory Silvers		Lucy: A Novel: Books: Jamaica Kincaid		1		This was my first reading of Jamaica Kincaid. <sssss> She has a short, concise style, which made me often feel like I was reading poetry. <sssss> However, I felt that it also had some downsides, like stifling character growth. <sssss> In Lucy, the title character comes to America to be an nanny for a rich couple with four young daughters. <sssss> Lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother, who for some reason she hates. <sssss> I wish we knew a bit more about Lucy, like why she hated her homeland so much. <sssss> It was an alright quick read, but had it been longer, I doubted it would have held my attention
S. K. Simmons		The Unsung Hero: Books: Suzanne Brockmann		2		The characters are Tom, a Navy seal specializing is counter terroism home on medical leave visiting his uncle, and Kally, a big-city doctor caring for her terminally ill father. <sssss> Sounds like a typical match for a romance novel, but this novel is so much more than that. <sssss> Kelly and Tom have a past, but her father and his uncle has an even bigger past. <sssss> All four of them have to draw on their pasts to protect the futures of themselves and many others. <sssss> Many long kept secrets must be bared and all their hearts must mend. <sssss> I think I have yet another author to add to my favorite list. <sssss> This novel not only has a suspensful, gripping plot, but is packed with romance, and excitment on many levels. <sssss> Most romance novels are only about two people with various cameo appearances by several others. <sssss> Not so, with this one. <sssss> There are four different stories wrapped eloquently into one novel, and expertly blended to create the whole. <sssss> The reader is kept guessing and there are surprises around evey turn. <sssss> Some are pleasant and some sad. <sssss> This is truly a moving tale on all levels. <sssss> You won 't be dissapointed
D. Jackson "rhett6"		Domicilium Decoratus : Books: Kelly Wearstler		1		What exactly is it that Ms Wearstler does? <sssss> This book is filled with "glam" pictures of recycled design ideas by Billy Haines,Dorothy Draper and Billy Baldwin,mostly of the "Hollywood Regency" style. <sssss> Ms Wearstler,whose home it is, appears in the photos dressed to the nines and seems to want us to think that she dreamed up this nifty new look. <sssss> Take a look at the new Billy Haines book and the just released book on Dorothy Draper and you'll see real designers at work AND whose work and style this really is.
PAUL FARRINGTON		Bioinformatics for Dummies: Books: Jean-Michel Claverie,Cedric Notredame		2		I'm glad I bought this book and I will continue to refer to it. <sssss> The remit of the Dummies series is to provide a guide to its subject matter without any great fuss. <sssss> The text focuses on practical techniques without unnecessary diversion into the detail of molecular biology or computer science. <sssss> In this respect it would have been a difficult book to author, readers having come from one discipline or the other. <sssss> I agree with previous reviewers that this is well worth reading before doing a bioinformatics course or degree. <sssss> Bioinformatics is a new field, and this book has delivered a useful introduction to it without recourse to expensive textbooks full of unreadable filler
Anonymous		The Wealth of Nations (Part 2)(Audio Classics): Books: Adam Smith		1		Beware of the Everyman's Library edition of this book (green hardcover, ribbon marker, isbn # 0-679-40564-X). <sssss> Book V dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted. <sssss> According to the introduction, this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low. <sssss> I wish I had known this BEFORE I ordered the book since now I have to buy a different edition in order to read Book V. What a ripoff
Harriet Klausner		Blood Retribution : A Lee Nez Novel (Lee Nez): Books: David Thurlo,Aimee Thurlo		2		He is a nightwalker, a Navaho vampire who because he is only half Nosferatu has the strength not to succumb to the allure of the dark side of his nature. <sssss> He is a New Mexico state police officer who is often teamed up with beautiful FBI agent Diane Lopez who not only knows what Lee Nez is but accepts him for his good heart. <sssss> Right now they are trying to infiltrate a smuggling ring made up of skinwalkers (Navaho witches) who can shape shift at night and still retain their ability to think like a human. <sssss> These smugglers known as the Silver Eagles go to Mexico in animal form, meet with their suppliers, and return with silver and turquoise for jewelry suppliers who get their products at black market prices. <sssss> The two cops seek to arrest humans who are part of the smuggling ring and kill the shapeshifters so they no longer can carry out their evil plans. <sssss> While Diane and Lee stalk the Silver Eagles, they are hunted by a vampire who wants to kill them because they murdered her nest including her husband and brother. <sssss> They remain on guard at all times because beside each other they don't know who they can trust. <sssss> Once again the Thurlos provide readers their interpretation of the vampire mythos unique to the Navaho culture. <sssss> Lee can stay in sunlight provided he uses sun block while his speed, strength and night vision make him a better police officer. <sssss> In the Thurlos world, skinwalkers are evil creatures who must be killed; a variation on the hapless victim werewolf legend. <sssss> BLOOD RETRIBUTION is a fantastic horror mystery thriller that readers of these genres will want to read. <sssss> Harriet Klausner
B. Teti		Bride and Groom (Dog Lover's Mysteries): Books: Susan Conant		1		I devoured all of this writer's books when I first discovered them and it had been quite some time since then when I bought this book. <sssss> I'm a real sucker for a book with dogs so I dove right in only to become disappointed all too quickly. <sssss> I didn't remember all the rambling. <sssss> It is rampant! <sssss> At times it was almost like reading a text book for all the 'skimming' that I did. <sssss> I can't say it was a waste of time but some more editing would be appreciated
Jay Furman		The Four Agreements Companion Book : Using the Four Agreements to Master the Dream of Your Life: Books: Miguel Ruiz,Janet Mills		1		This book was suggested reading as if pppppppppp quot; THE GREAT SECRET to PERSONAL FREEDOM pppppppppp quot; was going to be revealed. <sssss> It spoke of a self-centered mindset that seemed to suggest that I was to live my life how I wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me. <sssss> A very simplistic and selfish point of view
Terry Gold		The Great Game of Business: Books: Jack Stack,Bo Burlingham		2		How can people play the game if they don't know the rules or how to keep score? <sssss> Open book management means you teach people how business works, you share financials and you reward them for improving the profits of the company. <sssss> Good solid pppppppppp quot;how to pppppppppp quot; information if you want to set up a profit sharing plan and get people really involved in the success of the company
Michael A. Kelly "highgamma"		The Great Crash 1929: Books: John Kenneth Galbraith		1		While I did find the book informative and a good supplement to Robert Sobel's The Great Bull Market: Wall Street in the 1920s, Galbraith interjects his sarcastic view of the participants in the 1920s Bull Market way too much. <sssss> This makes parts of the book extremely difficult to read. <sssss> While I persevered to the end, I fouynd Sobel's account as informative and much more enjoyable to read
Jason Moser Kenneth "moser14"		Third Down and a War to Go: The All-American 1942 Wisconsin Badgers: Books: Terry Frei		1		Very average book! <sssss> Frei doesn't go down as one of my favorite sports writers. <sssss> Loves to sensationlize rather then just tell a great story
Stranger		How to Be Alone: Essays: Books: Jonathan Franzen		2		So here is a collection of essays by Jonathan Franzen, the wizard who brought us the highly intelligent and acutely mesmerizing novel of 2001, The Corrections. <sssss> Many of these essays originally appeared in literati mags such as Harper's and The New Yorker--so, readers should know what they're getting into. <sssss> I read this book mainly as an attempt to try to get a sense of Franzen as a corporeal human being, and not just some exalted author of an award-winning novel. <sssss> Overall, I liked most of the essays appearing in this collection. <sssss> From the promising opener, in which Franzen poignantly recounts his father's slow descension into quietus from Alzheimer's, we progress to a quasi-portentous pronouncement of the dangerous state of privacy in America, before Ashcroft and the Patriot Act invaded the American lexicon. <sssss> Why Bother (which was previously referred to as The Harper's Essay) is an interesting rumination on the inevitable failure of the novel in the 21st Century as a tool of social reform; the novel should not be used as a way to engender social reform, but, should rather be written--ultimately-- for plain old entertainment value, Franzen seems to argue. <sssss> Some of these essays seem to be a little discursive; Franzen evidentally has a lot to say, and seems to forget what the initial point of his arguments are, going off on long tangents; such as in Mr. <sssss> Difficult, where as some other reviewer stated, he begins with an interesting exploration of his artistic need to be "pretentious," but then slowly veers off into a history and ode to author William Gaddis. <sssss> Franzen once again proves to be a smart and sophisticated reader and writer, and this book perfectly showcases his aptitude for social commentary, without pontificating or being too offensively forward. <sssss> People may consider Franzen an "elitist," but I consider him to posses a well-read, inquisitive mind; there are far too few Jonathan Franzens around these days
M. Stier "life is an illusion"		A Smart Girl's Guide To Sticky Situations: How To Tackle Tricky, Icky Problems And Tough Times. (American Girl (Paperback Unnumbered)): Books: American Girl,Bonnie Timmons		2		As an adult I picked this up for my teen daughter and read through it and laughed and truly valued the advice within and wished I had it when I was a teen. <sssss> Also a lot of this advice will work for any age. <sssss> I loved the advice for falling down the stairs
Adel Makhoul		Culture and Imperialism: Books: Edward W. Said		1		This book is essentially about how culture is used to promote the interest of stronger, imperial powers. <sssss> Said condemns intellectuals in the West who in his eyes are "agents of exploitation". <sssss> Yet Said himself is an agent of racism. <sssss> A Pan Arabist, he always supported Arab unity and "Islam" at the expense of non-Arab and non-Moslem peoples. <sssss> Said directs and manipulates the Western taste for self criticim, and all that does is deflect the world's attention from Arab and Moslem attrocities committed against Christians, Kurds, Jews, Israelis, Coptic Christians, non-Arab Sudanese, etc. <sssss> Thus, reading Said, you would never realize that Sadam Hussein's poisoning of the Kurds has never been condemned by one Arab intellectual or leader. <sssss> This is because a racist prevalent attitude in the Arab mind is that the entire Middle East should be Arab. <sssss> This also explains the attitude towards Israel, a country that is predominantly non-Moslem and speaks a Middle Eastern language other than Arabic. <sssss> The pity is that Said himself is a Christian, yet he never spoke on behalf of Coptic Christians in Egypt, or the right of Christians to practice their faith in Saudi Arabia and probably other places in the Arab World. <sssss> He is facilitating the overall aim of PanArab Nationalists by distracting the West from what is happening in the Arab world. <sssss> For a better understanding of relations between the West and Islam, I recommend books by Bernard Lewis, such as "The Moslem Discovery of Europe" and the "Jews of Islam". <sssss> I also recommend books by the Egyptian scholar and Jewish refugee Yael Bat Yeor, such as "The Dhimmi".
Dale K. Adcock "doctor dale, RN"		Conservatives Without Conscience: Books: John Dean		2		'Conservatives Without Conscience' does nothing less than expose the matrix of political illusion with a comprehensive framework of science. <sssss> There is much more that could be said about the authoritarian character structure and the history of the science, but John Dean does a good job of explaining the basics, and how it applies to our modern political landscape. <sssss> This is not new information, it has just been sequestered in the hands of academics and the Carl Rove wing of the Republican party. <sssss> The academics keep measuring and refining their understanding, and Carl Rove and his party keeps using the information to manipulate the american public. <sssss> Finally, someone mainstream has laid it out for all to see. <sssss> Knowledge is power, so everyone should read his book. <sssss> However, one lesson to be learned from this book is that closed mindedness is a hallmark trait of the authoritarian character, so this is not a book written to convert anyone with strong authoritarian character traits. <sssss> They don't tend to read books much anyway. <sssss> It is a book for the open minded, that will put into context our mean spirited political landscape, the by any means necessary tactics of many named players, and the proto-fascist movement that has hijacked our country. <sssss> John Dean pulls no punches. <sssss> He names names and kicks butt. <sssss> He gets a little dry when trying to define his wing of conservatism as opposed to neo conservatism, but even that is well worth the effort. <sssss> If you have a shred of unease about the leaders of the Republican party and those who unquestionably support them, then read this book. <sssss> It is an eye opener
Thomas Duff "Duffbert"		The Cold Moon: Books: Jeffery Deaver		2		It's been awhile since I had a really good crime mystery read. <sssss> Therefore, I was excited when The Cold Moon by Jeffery Deaver arrived at the library. <sssss> The latest Lincoln Rhyme novel delivered just what I was looking for... twists, turns, and plenty of forensic work. <sssss> The plotline here starts out on two tracks. <sssss> A killer nicknamed The Watchmaker is murdering people using slow torture techniques. <sssss> His signature is leaving a particular clock style at the scene. <sssss> Rhyme and Amelia Sachs, his partner, are put on the case in order to solve it before more people die. <sssss> Sachs is also running her own case involving an apparent suicide that really turns out to be a murder. <sssss> The murder points to a run-down bar where a group of cops meet on a regular basis. <sssss> There's a strong chance that the cops are corrupt, so Sachs has to step carefully as it's not clear who she can trust. <sssss> The two cases converge when The Watchmaker is captured but the reality of his killings turn out to be a carefully staged plan to expose the corruption that Sachs is investigating. <sssss> But the layering of deception goes even deeper than that, and Rhyme has to continue to dig through each apparent motive and story to finally get to the core truth behind The Watchmaker... <sssss> If you want plot twists and turns, this book will definitely satisfy. <sssss> There are a number of scenes that appear to be transpiring in one fashion, only to be something else entirely. <sssss> The layering of plots by the killer never seems to end, and each new revelation ends up being the start of a new level of distraction. <sssss> A couple of the twists seemed to be a bit over the top, but not so much as to put me off the story. <sssss> It's a book I really didn't want to put down, even though I had other things I should be doing..
chuchu		A National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat: Books: Zell Miller		1		i used to follow politics but now i know better. <sssss> clinton is a hero to poor folk in the US only bc bush is such a nazi, sorry, but clinton did more than any pres in US history to cut welfare to the moms who need it the most! <sssss> i ain't no fool partisan of a richmans party and i don't like america. <sssss> and yes i'm born and raised in the US, there is no democracy here, only a moneycracy!!! <sssss> power to the ppl lets make a real country for the ppl, not the capitalist leech scum! <sssss> !
Andromeda		Andrew Jackson: A Life and Times (Random House Large Print): Books: H.W. Brands		2		A very good and indept look at Andrew Jackson. <sssss> The author was very thorough including a very good look at early 19th century American. <sssss> Andrew Jackson's a contraverisal President. <sssss> On the good side he defeated the British at the amazing Battle of New Orleans, help in expanding into the West, a great soldier, clearly loved his wife Rachel enough to duel to defend her, and was probably the only president who could threaten a state with military force if it tried to leave the Union and tough enough to make it happen. <sssss> On the flip side his percusion of Indians, the Trail of Tears, his many duels makes him a very complex and sometimes hard to understand person. <sssss> But still a great biography
Jeff Wignall "Author, The Joy of Digital Photography"		Sierra Club 2006 Engagement Calendar: Books: Sierra Club		2		I am a photographer and a writer and the author of numerous books on photography and I have had a copy of the Sierra Club Engagement Calendar on my desk every day for more than 20 years. <sssss> I find this calendar to be an inspiration in terms of both its beautiful photography and its wonderful geographic diversity. <sssss> I've never had a photo published in the Engagement book, but I've probably gathered more inspiration and ideas from these little calendars than from the hundreds of how-to books in my office. <sssss> The photos in these engagement calendars are the cream of the cream of the crop of the world's best nature photography. <sssss> Master photographers like the late Galen Rowell, who had many dozens of photos published here, consider it one of their finest showcases--and who can blame them. <sssss> Sierra Club has never relented on the quality of the reproduction of these superb datebooks and considering there are more than 50 photos in each book, the price is a bargain. <sssss> I have used this calendar as a journal and a diary of my writing progress for, literally, decades. <sssss> And whenever my brain starts to freeze after writing about photography for weeks on end and I need a new idea to write about, I simply flip through the calendars and I can discover hundreds of them in the work of many of the greatest modern nature-photography masters. <sssss> Also, when I'm looking for travel ideas, places to go to shoot new pictures for my books, I also look here for inspiration and ideas. <sssss> The Mojave Desert, Monument Valley, the Everglades, the Sonoran desert--these are all places that I learned about in great detail from these datebooks. <sssss> You learn more about a place by seeing great photos of it than you ever will by reading about it--or so I feel. <sssss> (Of course, you learn a great deal more if you hop on an plane and go see it!) <sssss> Finally, I gave my mother the engangement calendar for Christmas every year for around 20 years and she used them as a daily journal. <sssss> I still have every one of those journals and they are a great joy to flip through and see what she was up to each day. <sssss> Why this long winded (and very sincere!) <sssss> endorsement for such a simple product? <sssss> Because I owe these caldendars (and the Sierra Club) a debt of gratitude for inspiring me day after day, year after year, with the greatest photography in the world. <sssss> If you have a young photographer in your life, inspire them, show them how spectacular photographs of the natural world can be. <sssss> For an investment of under $15 you can change their perceptions of nature and help educate them about fine photography. <sssss> Someone gave me my first copy of this calendar many years ago and I've been grateful ever since. <sssss> Of course, I have to warn you, once you look at some of these photos you'll want to put your camera up on Ebay :) But don't do it! <sssss> Instead, use these photos as your photographic inspiration and your goal. <sssss> Jeff Wignall Author, The Joy of Digital Photography (Lark Books
Guide Mum "Lexina"		Read-Aloud Rhymes for the Very Young: Books: Jack Prelutsky,Marc Brown		2		We got this book out from our library recently and within a week I had ordered a copy for us. <sssss> My nearly 2 year old demands poems from it all the time (as only 2 year olds can demand!!) <sssss> and her older brothers have also enjoyed them. <sssss> The book has so many poems that struck a chord with us; just one small example: With recent cold weather I ended up sharing Dragon Smoke (about day being so cold you can see your own breath) with my oldest son's class at school. <sssss> I have also suggested that our local pre-school buys a copy for the adult library so that the poems can be shared with the children when relevant themes / moments arise. <sssss> The pictures are perfect for the poems creating a completely wonderful package. <sssss> It is just an absolutely superb book and one I will be buying as a present for many other families. <sssss> I think in a way the title is a bit of a pity, (although completly reasonable), as these poems will last a lot longer than just for the "very Young"
		Good Sports: Winning, Losing, and Everything in Between: Books: Therese Kauchak,Norm Bendell		2		pppppppppp quot;Good Sports pppppppppp quot; is a book which helps girls to be the pppppppppp quot;best athlete you can be. <sssss> pppppppppp quot; It catagorizes players, parents, and other important people into real-life situations. <sssss> It has quizes, quotes from other athletes, and memory pages. <sssss> Also, it offers a lot of web sites and other addresses for girls to look up their favorite sports. <sssss> More importantly, this book shows girls what teamwork and good sportsmanship is all about. <sssss> One of my favorite parts in the book says: pppppppppp quot;Sometimes heart is the strongest muscle. <sssss> pppppppppp quot; This book also tells girls how to take good care of yourself- to eat healthy so that you are a better athlete. <sssss> It includes the food pyramid and what one serving is. <sssss> pppppppppp quot;Good Sports pppppppppp quot; involves pppppppppp quot;Power Drills pppppppppp quot; and advice from other girls. <sssss> It goes inside the lives of other athletes, such as Michelle Kwan, but also shows girls'lives who are teens or pre-teens. <sssss> This book not only focuses on the physical parts of playing a game, but on the mental part as well: keeping your dreams alive even when you're at the bottom of the team, or you were embarrassed at a basketball game when you tripped. <sssss> I would reccommend pppppppppp quot;Good Sports pppppppppp quot; to any female athelete, whether you are experienced or haven't even started yet. <sssss> It teaches you the basics and also the mental parts of a game! <sssss> It has advice on keeping your mind and body strong, along with being a good winner and loser. <sssss> It has advice from other athletes, famous or otherwise, memory pages to record your victories, dreams and goals, and ways to reach sports associations. <sssss> As the book says, it includes pppppppppp quot;Winning. <sssss> Losing. <sssss> And everything in between. <sssss> pppppppppp quot
Fish-stic "Fish"		Fear Nothing: Books: Dean Koontz		2		Fear nothing is about Christopher Snow, whose parents die in supposedly innocent ways, but Chris soon finds out that what is seems is not really what it is, and even that his little town of Moonlight Bay is stranger, and scarier, than he thought. <sssss> Chris then sets out with his friends, and his dog, to find out the truth about what's really going on. <sssss> Fear Nothing is a good plot written in typical Koontz style. <sssss> Fear nothing grabs you from the beginning and holds you all the way through. <sssss> It keeps you guessing and just when you think you have it figured out, it throws something new at you and makes you guess some more. <sssss> Koontz creates some very likable characters and by the end of the story, you like them, and feel as if you know them. <sssss> Fear Nothing is very descriptive, Koontz describes his locations so well you feel like you're in them, and experiencing the plot right next to the main character. <sssss> I have not read the sequel, but I am anxious to do so.
Reader "Reader"		Leap of Faith: Books: Danielle Steel		1		This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. <sssss> There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there
Dan Seidman		The Philosophy Gym: Books: Stephen Law		1		Horribly disappointing. <sssss> These manufactured dialogues are evidently Stephen Law's way of dealing with his personal problems with religion. <sssss> For example, in one chapter Law manipulates his "teaching" by having God contradict the Bible (the assumption being God's the author) in a dialogue with a conservative religious person. <sssss> Law even sarcastically concludes the chapter by saying this dialogue is only a dream, the real God would probably respond differently. <sssss> Good idea for a book, ruined by the authors distorted logic. <sssss> There are numerous ad hominen and circular reasoning errors. <sssss> The title and premise fooled me into reading it. <sssss> Mr. Law, how will you pay back the readers for wasting the time they invested in your philosphical rant against religion
Maru		The Emperor's New Mind: Books: Roger Penrose		1		I will be brief: Penroses writing is mediocre, his drawings obfuscate more than clarify. <sssss> The vast majority of the book is devoted to completely and utterly extraneous topics, and seems to largely be a platform for Penroses new quantum theories. <sssss> His arguments are unclear, weak and largely dependent on philosphers like Lucas and Searle, while his idea of quantum effects is improbable and surely in the end irrelevant (cannot computers tap into quantum effects?) <sssss> and his knowledge of computer science deeply, deeply suspect. <sssss> For example, I quote here from the final sections which actually have something to do with his ostensible reason for writing the book: "Neverthless, one still might imagine some kind of natural selection process being effective for producing approximately valid algorithms. <sssss> Personally, I find this very hard to believe, however." <sssss> The entire flourishing, commercially succesful field of evolutionary computing begs to differ here, Mr. Penrose. <sssss> SUch bonehead errors compells me to point out that this mathematician has no clothes
W. B Garrison		Shadow Man: Books: John Katzenbach		1		John Katzenbach is an accomplished author and I had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels (The Analyst), so I was surprised at how bad The Shadow Man was. <sssss> The premise of the plot is that four very old Jewish people, survivors of the Holecaust, believe they have seen the "Shadow Man". <sssss> The Shadow Man was a Jew who joined forces with the Nazis to find Jews that were hiding to avoid certain doom in concentration camps. <sssss> These four old people feared the Shadow Man more than anything. <sssss> When one of them is killed, a retired police detective named Simon Winter looks into who the Shadow Man is. <sssss> Meanwhile, the Miami police are also investigating the death of the elderly Jewish woman and have young gangster as a suspect. <sssss> Eventually, Winter and the police and the District Attourney join to hunt the Shadow Man, a man of pure evil. <sssss> As the book villian, it was hard to fear a villian who was a killer 50 years ago but was now in his 70s. <sssss> Also, this book barely touches on WWII, yet purports at times to be a novel about WWII. <sssss> I've read a lot of great WWII novels, and this book would have been great if it had been set in the 60s. <sssss> But setting it present day with senior citizens and the main characters wasn't too exciting. <sssss> It wasn't exciting primarily because I wondered where had the Shadow Man been all these years? <sssss> Why was he starting to kill now? <sssss> The Shadow Man had no motivation to kill. <sssss> Finally, I realized I didn't like this book when I was skipping paragraphs at a time during the last 20 pages. <sssss> The entire book was like this with each character prone to long rambling inner thoughts that really added nothing to the story. <sssss> If you take away the WWII angle, this novel is bad. <sssss> The WWII angle adds some excitement, but there are probably thousands of books out there that relate the horror of WWII better than this one does. <sssss> The review from Publishers Weekly printed above summarizes my thoughts and deserves to be repeated..."Katzenbach (Just Cause) has some good Holocaust and WWII vignettes and pretty good cop-talk here, but the book is burdened by flat characterization, a slow pace, an odd, unsatisfying ending and a serious need for editing.
Chris B "book nut"		The Five Love Languages: How To Express Heartfelt Commitment To Your Mate: Books: Gary D. Chapman		2		The book arrived as expected and was in great shape. <sssss> Thanks
Olive Oyl "Avid Reader"		Term Limits (Chivers Sound Library American Collections (Audio)): Books: Vince Flynn,Nick Sullivan		2		I think some of the previous reviwers with negative opinions are taking this book waaay too seriously. <sssss> As political thrillers go, this is one of the best of the genre. <sssss> It's packed with insider information, from power-mad politicians and the amoral king-makers who advise them, to nerves-of-steel assassins avoiding the meticulous pursuit of the FBI. <sssss> Granted the premise is implausible: a group of former SEALS assassinate a group of congressmen and senators who the SEALS believe have sold the country down the river (or, in the Southern vernacular, because "they needed killin'"). <sssss> While one can argue whether the SEALS have the high moral ground in this setting, it doesn't detract from the page-turning non-stop action. <sssss> Like a thrill ride at Disneyland, this book should not be examined too critically. <sssss> Just get in, hold on, close your eyes, and enjoy the ride
Randall L. Wilson "Randy Wilson"		The Whole Equation: A History of Hollywood: Books: David Thomson		2		First off this is "A History of Hollywood" not "THE History of Hollywood." <sssss> David Thomson isn't writing the chronological, straight-up, blow-by-blow account of Hollywood movies. <sssss> "The Whole Equation" is an essay that takes as its question, "are Hollywood films ever art like a Beethoven symphony or a Picasso painting?" <sssss> He says they are both more and less than that. <sssss> More because American film captures the tension between wanting to make money and wanting to say something which allows for the unintentional to happen. <sssss> That serendipity is wonderful when it works which isn't often. <sssss> Less because there are always artistic compromises as someone is always looking at the budget and thinking about the profits. <sssss> And unlike most film critics he is just fine with this tension. <sssss> His argument is that to understand and appreciate American film, you have to understand that it's always about the money and about the art. <sssss> That means it is never truly art in any pure way (but is any art truly pure?). <sssss> To tell you the truth, I don't think the book succeeds that well on that level. <sssss> He points out various people and their struggles with this dilemma through out the history of American film but he doesn't developed a coherent argument that builds on his initial insight. <sssss> For me, that just didn't matter. <sssss> What makes it a terrific read is that David Thomson knows and loves film. <sssss> He writes with a adolescent thrill and openness about his subject that makes it fun and poetic. <sssss> He uses the film "Chinatown" as his framing device and as that is my all-time favorite movie, I was in heaven. <sssss> He is not a deep thinker but his book crackles with his delight in sensations whether of the movie theater, the audience, the actors, the costumes, the music, all of it. <sssss> He constantly raises questions and throws out insights that just tumble onto each other until you realize that like watching a film, you must just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride.
M. Dion		Season of the Machete: Books: James Patterson		1		This book was a complete waste. <sssss> It was boring to read and hard to follow. <sssss> I finished the book just see how it ended and hoping to clear up the confusion. <sssss> I never should have read past the first chapter. <sssss> Read Pop Goes the Weasle, or Lake House by Patterson. <sssss> Just not this book. <sssss> It is hard to believe it is written by the same author
Bill C.		War Without End: Israelis, Palestinians, and the Struggle for a Promised Land: Books: Anton La Guardia		1		Author La Guardia mentions how the Lemba of Africa have the Jewish gene. <sssss> Fine! <sssss> But when he deals (in several pages mind you)with the Falashas (also of Africa) he never mentions that genetic studies have positively shown these Jews NOT to be descended from the 12 Tribes of Israel despite the Falashas's longtime rep for possibly being a Lost Tribe of Israel which, again, has now been 100% disproven through genetic studies
Comie Zapr		The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life: Books: Erving Goffman		1		This is a revolutionary book. <sssss> It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage. <sssss> It's questionable how novel this metaphor is, but this is certianly its first explicit statement. <sssss> The language used to present the ideas of the author is, like most sociological writing, unecessarily complicated. <sssss> There are some problems with clarity and structure; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me. <sssss> No sociological background is presupposed, there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources, many footnotes, and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book. <sssss> So if you are interested in reading sociology, this is probably a good place to start (again, the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it's bane as an introduction). <sssss> However, the book is misguided. <sssss> The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary. <sssss> The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer. <sssss> (The following is a charicature of the author's argument). <sssss> There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people (the audience) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor. <sssss> Well, if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations, infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage, "All the world is not, of course, a stage, but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify" (p 72). <sssss> The performances can either be with individuals, or groups of people, and they can be performing conciously or unconciously. <sssss> (end of charicature) There are other arguments, obviously, and the statement "we can draw a parallel with other situations" is most of the content of the book, which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence. <sssss> But the real question here is, is the view worthwhile? <sssss> My answer: No. <sssss> Social interaction is a complex phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor. <sssss> Yes, some social interaction is like a performance, where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another. <sssss> Yes, some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs. <sssss> However, most social interaction is exactly the way we see it, conciously controlled, meaningful, purposeful interaction with individuals; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a "reality". <sssss> I hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out: the book is a waste of time. <sssss> Where the author is right, the statement is little more than common sense. <sssss> Where the author goes outside of common sense, he's wrong, sometimes plainly so. <sssss> This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes, that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control (here the wool is the performance, and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions). <sssss> There is no real empirical support given for most of the claims. <sssss> Where "evidence" is given, the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter. <sssss> Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth. <sssss> Various sources of sociology are cited, but this is more like intellectual bullying. <sssss> Saying that some author, which also didnt have any empirical support for his claims, agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims. <sssss> The claims in the book have no practical application in the world, but only serve to intepret situations differently, and in personal opinion, less correctly. <sssss> Nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology. <sssss> In short, this isnt a scientific study at all. <sssss> My final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph, the use of language. <sssss> The best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction "A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants" (15). <sssss> This is a curios definition. <sssss> Me breathing while i work is a performance, it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers. <sssss> Me staring into space is a performance, other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced. <sssss> Infact, me simply existing is a performance, since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants, as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing. <sssss> Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person, and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance. <sssss> He didnt. <sssss> He used a word that we associate with controlled behavior (performance) and defined it in a way no one is used to. <sssss> Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance, its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality. <sssss> I hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to Goffman and sociology more generally. <sssss> So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt. <sssss> Why wont this subject go away? <sssss> This book is an integral part of sociology, and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition. <sssss> The methods are questionable; the style is obscure. <sssss> Like it or hate it, sociology is a part of modern thought. <sssss> Read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings
Larry Overcast		Immigration Law and Procedure in a Nutshell (Nutshell Series): Books: David S. Weissbrodt,Laura Danielson		2		I am a manager for a Federal Govt Agency. <sssss> I found this book informational and easy to understand. <sssss> Immigration law is a complex subject. <sssss> The book is easy to read and addresses many important aspects related to this subject. <sssss> The sections related to inadmissability, removal are well written and easy to understand. <sssss> The chapters related to the history of various classes of immigrants was intersting as well. <sssss> I would recommend the book for persons who want to expand their knowledge of this topic
AcornMan		Coyotes: A Journey Through the Secret World of America's Illegal Aliens: Books: Ted Conover		2		Written all the way back in the mid-1980s, long before all the heated rhetoric about illegal immigration going on in the US today, this book has turned out to be amazingly prescient. <sssss> I feel like I would have had a much better understanding of this subject (not to mention appreciation of the people involved) had I discovered it a long time ago, but I suppose late is better than never. <sssss> Ted Conover did what I don't imagine very many other Americans would have the courage to do: Cross illegally from Mexico into the US with Mexicans doing the same thing. <sssss> In doing so, he gives readers incredible insight into what compels some Mexicans to make that journey (i.e what life is like where they come from), what the journey is like, and what awaits them on this side of the border. <sssss> I found myself exceedingly grateful for having been born American and simply in awe of the Mexicans who live such vastly disparate lives from their privileged neighbors to the north. <sssss> Conover simply relates his experiences to readers without the kind of ideological commentary or other editorializing that can get in the way of the facts surrounding the contentious issues involved. <sssss> Coyotes is a well-written, touching, informative, and inspiring book that should be required reading for all Americans before they open their mouths about illegal immigration
andyroo "andrew"		Great Expectations (Everyman's Library (Cloth)): Books: Charles Dickens		2		this book sucks very badly! <sssss> as soon as i was on the second page i threw it in the fire place! <sssss> !
M. Strange "michelleinmd"		Murder Uncorked (Prime Crime Mysteries): Books: Michele Scott		1		Ultimately the ending was so outrageous that it took away from the rest of the story. <sssss> I would not recommend it to anyone for that reason. <sssss> I've already given my copy away.
New Hubby		The Blue Rose: An English Garden Mystery: Books: Anthony Eglin		1		I've read some of the other reviews, and I couldn't disagree more. <sssss> This book is not a page-turner. <sssss> I found myself skipping over whole sections of prose because they were boring and sometimes needless. <sssss> The story is straighforward. <sssss> Hardly any surprises. <sssss> Hardly any twists or turns. <sssss> Bad guys are always bad guys. <sssss> Good guys are always good guys. <sssss> There's no hidden agenda lurking through the story. <sssss> The blue rose is a natural anomaly. <sssss> The people who really want it -- the people willing to steal and kill for it -- are conveniently identified as people willing to steal and kill for the blue rose. <sssss> There's no "mystery" here really. <sssss> It's just a matter of getting to the end of the book
A. Kienitz		Burning Cold: The Cruise Ship Prinsendam and the Greatest Sea Rescue of all Time: Books: H. Paul Jeffers		1		I was there, as were several of my fellow Sitka Fire Department EMT's and State Troopers from the Sitka Academy. <sssss> The 6 of us, along with two parajumpers from the Canadian Armed Services were flown through the typhoon winds, on a helicopter, out to the Williamsburgh where we spent the next 33 hours attending to the rescued passengers - literally giving them the clothes off our backs and keeping them calmed. <sssss> We knew there was a doctor onboard, from Anchorage, but we literally never met or saw him - I'm sure he did good work in the little clinic he had set up - but that is where he stayed. <sssss> The real story was out in the rest of the ship that weekend. <sssss> But I was disappointed to see that Mr. Jeffers failed to fully research this book - the role the Sitka rescue teams played (both on the Williamsburgh and trying to assess/fight the fire on the Prinsendam) was totally overlooked - despite the fact that there is a lot of documentation available that tells our story - which was the human side pppppppppp had some quite amusing moments in the face of this event. <sssss> I was so looking forward to this book and then to find out he left a large part of the story out, was very sad. <sssss> At least we all have our commendations from both the Coast Guard commendant and the Canadian armed services - they knew we were there! <sssss> Too bad Mr. Jeffers didn't due diligence.
Paul Nally		Assassin: A Thriller (Hawke (Pocket Star Paperback)): Books: Ted Bell		1		I picked up this book at the airport as I was heading to Japan. <sssss> While staying with my in laws in the country, there is no English language anything. <sssss> This is all I brought so I had to finish it. <sssss> But it was a struggle. <sssss> Firstly I like complex thrillers, and I liked all the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan series. <sssss> Technically excellent, if with totally one dimensional characters. <sssss> This book reminds me of the original Star Trek, where everyone but the Captain is affected by the virus. <sssss> The hero is always right. <sssss> Bell can write, his prose, I think is fine, but the scenarios are sometimes laughably implausible. <sssss> I also agree with another reviewer here that there is an unpleasant racist overtone in some of his depictions of some of the bad guys. <sssss> Overall awful, just awful. <sssss> My first and last Bell book. <sssss> I will be leaving the rest of the Bell collection on the shelf
A. J. CORNISH-BOWDEN		Lifelines: Life beyond the Gene: Books: Steven Rose		1		Most books that set out to explain why organisms behave as they do describe observations of behaviour on almost every page. <sssss> The books of Richard Dawkins, whom Rose selects as his special target, illustrate this well: readers can reject all of his interpretations while remaining fascinated by the purely factual information that they contain. <sssss> How one can hope to convince anyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with abundant facts? <sssss> Yet hard biological information is extremely sparse in Rose's book. <sssss> There is a great deal about what he thinks of other biologists' opinions, but almost no observations from behavioural biology. <sssss> Nonetheless, in his preface he aligns himself with the practising biologists "who spend a significant part of every working day thinking about and designing experiments", dismissing Dawkins and Daniel Dennett as "people who either no longer do science or never did it." <sssss> What a pity, therefore, that he chose to include so little of the experimental basis of his ideas in his book. <sssss> There are a few vague remarks about how chicks behave, and that's about it.
Marc Winter		The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball: Books: John Taylor		2		Rather than reading a biography of Red Auerbach, Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell, turn to this period book! <sssss> Here you get everything: a complete portrayal of the situation of African American who were just starting to segregate professional sports outside of the Brooklyn Dodgers. <sssss> But at the same time it is an introduction to a time, when athletes were not the superstars of today. <sssss> On top of that, you get enough biographcal information on Russell and Chamberlain, but also on Cousy, Auerbach and many others. <sssss> The book is very well written and starts right with information, no tedious introduction to plough through
JSantellana		The Discipline Book: How to Have a Better-Behaved Child From Birth to Age Ten: Books: Martha Sears,William Sears		1		I was looking for a book with practical advice on how to handle real-life situations. <sssss> I felt most of the book talked about how to parent, i.e. <sssss> cosleeping, wearing baby, etc, but did not give advice on how to handle a specific situation. <sssss> What do i do when my child runs away from me toward the street and then hits and bites me when I pick him up? <sssss> I don't want to spank, but a 24-month old just doesn't take to "a talk" or timeout like Dr. Sears says he should. <sssss> The Sears Birth Book was amazing, I recommend it to anyone, but this book did not help me answer my questions
Ellie Reasoner		The Complete New Yorker: Eighty Years of the Nation's Greatest Magazine (Book pppppppppp 8 DVD-ROMs): Books: New Yorker,David Remnick		2		We are so truly lucky to live in an age when something like this is possible! <sssss> Without existing virtual technologies, compiling a complete collection of the New Yorker would otherwise be a near impossibility due to space considerations, availability, and of course the daunting financial investment. <sssss> For the price of a modest concert, eighty years of intelligent discourse, satire, observation and fiction are all available. <sssss> I have nothing negative to say about this; it does what it promises and does it well. <sssss> It still amazes me that I now have every issue of The New Yorker, and look forward to the continuation of this extraordinary trend of publications releasing the entirety of their output
J.F. Groote		Table of Integrals, Series, and Products, Sixth Edition: Books: I. S. Gradshteyn,I. M. Ryzhik,Alan Jeffrey,Daniel Zwillinger		1		I bought this software hoping that it would help me to find required mathematical formulas faster. <sssss> At home on my powermac (OSX.1, OS9.2) I only see messed up windows. <sssss> Furthermore, the formulas are unreadable, using an archaic font. <sssss> Trying to save the day, I went to my linux machine at work reading pppppppppp quot;Your operating system, Linux 2.2.19-7.0.1, is not supported by this software. <sssss> It appears that the software is only suitable for some SUN and SGI machines. <sssss> It only appears to run properly on a windows machine. <sssss> From an editor, who I remember, is one of the few persons finding errors in Knuth's TeX system, I expected much better
H. D. Zabitz		Hard Way, The (Jack Reacher): Books: Lee Child,Dick Hill		1		I am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book. <sssss> Honestly, it was a complete waste of my time. <sssss> To quote a friend, it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar. <sssss> If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book
H. Edwin Detlie "Ed Detlie"		BlackBerry in a Snap (Sams Teach Yourself): Books: Michael Morrison		1		The book was specific to one particular model of BlackBerry. <sssss> They should have that in the title. <sssss> It was of no use to me. <sssss> After five minutes, I set it aside to gather dust.
D. Nishimoto "Golden Lion"		New Rules for the New Economy: Books: Kevin Kelly		2		The new economy is a global economy favoring intangible things: ideas, information, and relationships and is intensely interlinked. <sssss> Today, the new information based sector occupies over 15% of the total US economy. <sssss> In the postindustrial society, communication has become the economy and the cultural, technological, and conceptual impacts reverberate at the roots of our lives. <sssss> The financial sector has reshaped the economy; the financial sector ownership involves only a small number of people; the financial innovations include: mortgages, insurance, venture funding, stocks, checks, credit cards, and mutual funds; the financial sector has given rise to corporations, market capitalism, the industrial age, and has influenced how all business has been done. <sssss> Since communication is the economy, the net is the future. <sssss> The net has accelerated in usage due to the increase in silicon chips and fiber optic data transmission; the net is weaving lives, minds, and artifacts into a global scale network; the result is the swarm of information, reticulating the surface of the planet; the new economy will increasing obey the logic of the networks and understanding the network will be the key to understanding how the economy works. <sssss> In 1997, there were 6 billion non-computer chips and by 2005 the predicted usage was at 10 billion. <sssss> The network represents connectivity. <sssss> We are connection everything to everything. <sssss> The network values the dumb power of bits in the swarm; the connectivity and usage of the dumb bits or parts in the swarm yield smart results; and we don't need advanced Artificial Intelligence to make an intelligent system. <sssss> The network is a link of distributed, bottom up, data bits; it lets things communicate among themselves and takes a decentralized approach for communication, for example, manufacturing robots scheduling their own work based on incoming requests, as they bid on work dependant on their capability. <sssss> The swarm aim is superior performance in a turbulent environment. <sssss> Consider the power of the "Wisdom of the crowds". <sssss> In one case sample, 5,000 attendees, at a computer graphics conference were give individual access to a simulator and the task on how too land a plane. <sssss> The attendee had novice knowledge about how to land the plane. <sssss> The jet responded to the average decisions of the swarm. <sssss> The group landed the jet with almost no direction. <sssss> In another case example, the group was given the task to navigate a submarine and go look for buried treasure. <sssss> The group could not initiate any movement until leadership from a loud speaker was given to "go right". <sssss> The leadership unlocked the paralysis of the swarm and the direction facilitated action. <sssss> Technology success is measured on how invisible it becomes to the end user and how effective it becomes to the long term strategy in developing products and services that can't be ignored. <sssss> The power of the network increases in value n power 2 where n is the number of members. <sssss> Therefore, networks need to increase their critical mass of members to become effective. <sssss> Innovation attracts members. <sssss> Innovation is more important than price; price is the derivative of innovation; monopolies push up price and decrease quality and create a dangerous singular source of innovation; and the network destroys monopolies through collective innovation, such as, open source.
