Blaine Greenfield "eclectic reader"		The Mastery of Love: A Practical Guide to the Art of Relationship: A Toltec Wisdom Book: Books: Miguel Ruiz		2		I loved THE FOUR AGREEMENTS by Don Miguel Ruiz, in which he shared wisdom from his Toltec ancestors . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> it helped me and I'm sure countless others develop a simple, yet effective code of personal conduct. <sssss> So when I had the chance to listen to his follow-up book, THE MASTERY OF LOVE, I naturally was intrigued by the possibility of gaining some more valuable insights from the author--this time dealing with the subject of both developing and maintaining a loving relationship. <sssss> Perhaps my only disappointment in this title was that it was too short . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> I gained so much from it that after one listening, I immediately felt the need to go back and listen a second time . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> methinks that if you were reading it, you'd do the same, if just to master this one concept: To try to change somebody is to try to change a dog or cat. <sssss> You love them for who they are. <sssss> If you're with somebody, don't try to change him or her. <sssss> Also, there were these other valuable tidbits: Let go of the past and begin every day with a high level of love. <sssss> If you don't love yourself, you can change your belief and your life will change. <sssss> When you hear your heart guiding you to happiness, make a choice and stick to it. <sssss> Forgive others, and you will see miracles happen in your life. <sssss> And lastly, there was this one that really struck home: If your choice is to be in a relationship and your partner is playing the same game . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> what a gift!
Filmbuff-reads stuff		Insomnia: A Novel: Books: Stephen King		1		I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. <sssss> I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story. <sssss> This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. <sssss> And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. <sssss> This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book. <sssss> Three years which were evidently wasted. <sssss> The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification. <sssss> "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with. <sssss> He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. <sssss> His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. <sssss> Instead she serves as a secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. <sssss> King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters. <sssss> Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes. <sssss> Then there's the whole abortion mess. <sssss> This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. <sssss> Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device. <sssss> I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. <sssss> The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' <sssss> His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. <sssss> It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. <sssss> This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning. <sssss> One last thing, the villians just don't work. <sssss> They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. <sssss> Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? <sssss> Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? <sssss> The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. <sssss> Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered. <sssss> I rest my case.
Joann Martorana "Joann"		A Secret Affair: Books: Barbara Taylor Bradford		1		i felt as if this book was way below my reading leve
jmcguire		MUD Game Programming (Game Development): Books: Ron Penton		2		When I read Ron Penton's first book, Data Structures for Game Programming, I couldn't wait to see what he did next. <sssss> MUD Game Programming lived up to all of my expectations, and indeed surpassed them. <sssss> The author has an extraordinary knack for making complex topics understandable -- and, equally important, making them interesting. <sssss> Reading MUD Game Programming is like having a friendly, cheerful expert sitting down next to you and showing you the tricks of the trade. <sssss> Instead of just telling you what to do, he explains the thinking behind the decisions that go into the design of a complex program such as a MUD server, enabling you to make the decisions that are right for your own project, which might not be the same. <sssss> You end up with not just knowledge but understanding. <sssss> I highly recommend MUD Game Programming to people doing any type of network-based multiplayer programming, not just traditional MUDs. <sssss> I'd give this book six stars if they'd let me
George Knightley		A Little Princess: Books: Frances Hodgson Burnett,Tasha Tudor		2		This book is more dated than THE SECRET GARDEN, but it's still a great story. <sssss> It's hard NOT to identify with Sara Crewe. <sssss> I loved this book as a child (though not as much as I loved THE SECRET GARDEN, which I think is a better book). <sssss> However, A LITTLE PRINCESS may appeal more to some people; some readers may find the story stronger and the main character, Sara Crewe, more likable. <sssss> Sara's determination to stay herself despite how other people treat her and view her is inspiring and may help readers through tough times of their own. <sssss> Some scenes (I don't want to spoil the surprise by describing them) are magical. <sssss> A LITTLE PRINCESS is a great story that makes readers think. <sssss> Some of those thoughts make you uncomfortable, like the thoughts about differences between rich and poor children - but that (I think) is part of the book's greatness. <sssss> Be sure to get an unabridged edition: this book is beautifully written and should not be simplified. <sssss> Kids now CAN read and will love this book: at least, every girl to whom I have given a copy has read it and reread it -- on her own. <sssss> For a modern, well-written book about another girl at an English boarding school, read Libby Koponen's BLOW OUT THE MOON. <sssss> It has the same classic feel, though American heroine is very different from Sara in some ways (though she too is determined to hang onto her identity) and MOON is quite funny
Liane J. Leedom, M.D.		Setting Limits with Your Strong-Willed Child : Eliminating Conflict by Establishing Clear, Firm, and Respectful Boundaries: Books: Robert J. MacKenzie Ed.D.		2		This book gives very good advice about managing behavior problems in difficult children. <sssss> However, the concept of a "strong-willed child" is confusing because it implies a child with will power or self control. <sssss> These difficult children actually have poor will power and self control. <sssss> The techniques given in this book will help teach such children self control. <sssss> It is important to understand that the cause of the strong-willed child is an excessive drive for power over others. <sssss> The strong willed child wants to be Captain and he wants everyone else including his parents to be a deck hand. <sssss> Parenting this type of child correctly, will help him learn to better control himself and respect others. <sssss> However, he will likely never be the compliant child that some parents are hoping for. <sssss> [...
Richard Vidaurri		Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire (Second Edition): Books: Chalmers Johnson		1		I came to Blowback by way of a year-long research project on globalization. <sssss> Over the past year I have read dozens of books, both scholary and popular, on this topic. <sssss> Right - Left - Love America - Hate America - Multi-Cultural - Eurocentric; I've suffered through them all ( happily, there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject ). <sssss> First let me state that Chalmers Johnson, this regrettable book notwithstanding, is not by profession the village diot. <sssss> Johnson is a highly respected economic and political analyst, a man who used to be worth listening to. <sssss> What happened? <sssss> How did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly unanalytical smorgasborg? <sssss> Where did the imperialist conspiracy rant come from? <sssss> Johnson, where did you go? <sssss> Well, the easy answer is that he delves into complex areas of which he has no knowledge. <sssss> His take on America's military policies is ludicrous. <sssss> Anyone who questions why the U.S. Army is still in Korea after 50+ years need only point to Seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north, where he will discover NORTH KOREA. <sssss> Of coures once an idealogue veers into unknown territory there is no other path left for him than that of conspiracy. <sssss> Conspiracy "theory" is all fine and good for the lazy and uneducated; it's their sanctuary; but for a scholar of Johnson's caliber to go there is incomprehensible. <sssss> Unti you see what I saw. <sssss> The professional works that I read on globalization were pretty much uniform in that they addressed one or another facet of free-trade and concluded more-or-less-nothing, all in scholarly language. <sssss> For the most part the popular books were not nominally about globalization at all, although globalization was the only thread holding the books together, and to each other. <sssss> Brushing aside the fact that most of the authors of the popular group are ageing oddballs from the 60s ( you underestimate the mustard-gas-like effect of that era at your peril ),the only possible reason for these immensely angry, nonsensical books is this: no one fully understands globalization. <sssss> No one. <sssss> Even when you define the thing narrowly it is a cantankerous beast, too young to tame; growing unpredictably every day like the Blob. <sssss> They're frustrated, these authors. <sssss> I can't blame them, but for some reason they must have a scapegoat and the've rounded up the usual suspect, America, as in why does America impose - dominate - ignore, etc. <sssss> the third world? <sssss> Silly question, really. <sssss> You're at the top of the food chain, what do they expect you to do? <sssss> When bad things happen you want to be sure they happen to someone else.
John Matlock "Gunny"		Edgar Allan Poe pppppppppp The Juke-Box: Uncollected Poems, Drafts, and Fragments: Books: Elizabeth Bishop,Alice Quinn		2		This rather strangely titled book is a tribute to the demand for Elizabeth Bishop's work. <sssss> It is a set of pieces gleaned from some 3,500 pages in the Vassar College library collection. <sssss> Not exactly random (but almost) here are 108 poems, some prose, notes she took, some sketches, some facimilies of her papers, some sketches she made, and other pieces harder to describe. <sssss> Obviously this is a book that will appeal most to people who are already Elizabeth Bishop fans. <sssss> This is more of a work in process. <sssss> It tells more about her as a person, it illustrates the great effort she went to get her poems just right before sending them off for publication. <sssss> It shows something of the way her mind worked. <sssss> The work here is not Ms. Bishop's best. <sssss> It's unfinished. <sssss> Some of the shorter pieces, fragments really, make you wonder where she might have taken it.
D. Dubei "ioancuza"		Weirdos From Another Planet!: Books: Bill Watterson		2		truly and surely one of the best comic strips ever! <sssss> were you to be sick in bed and need something to make you laugh, this is the best medicine
Rachael Sall "Rachael"		The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Books: Mark Twain,Mike McShane		2		The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been argued as a racial controversy since the first day it was published. <sssss> Shortly after it was accessible to the public, multiple committees banned the book, proclaiming it to be racist and "trash". <sssss> To this day, Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is banned in several school districts. <sssss> In my personal copy of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, there is a helpful and informative introduction and notes throughout the text written by Robert O'Meally. <sssss> He clearly states that the intent of Twain's word usage is needed in order to properly and vividly describe the setting and tone of the book. <sssss> His usage of the racial slur "nigger" can be seen as offensive, but I believe it was necessary for it to be realistic. <sssss> The dialogue that Huckleberry uses throughout the book stays very true to his character, time, and place, at which the slur was used casually. <sssss> Besides the usage of the word "nigger", characters in the book often loudly express their racist mentality. <sssss> In the begining of Chapter 14, Huck and Jim are talking about all sorts of topics, both of them speaking their mind. <sssss> Twain describes Huck's thoughts: "Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head, for a nigger." <sssss> Obviously some would perceive this to be intolerable and crude, yet I believe that Twain is simply describing the way Huck thinks of Jim. <sssss> The growing friendship between Huck and Jim is the basis of the entire novel. <sssss> The book depicts the way Huck feels and thinks about several ideas and concepts about life, the way he feels about his friend must be present and elaborate. <sssss> I strongly support Mark Twain's the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. <sssss> The book wins people over with it 's dialogue, plot, originality, and capability to express a realistic story that takes place in a racist and unjust America.
bonnie		The Wings of the Dove: Books: Henry James		1		I know H. James is considered one of the "Greats" of American literature and I question my taste for hating most of his writing. <sssss> With few exceptions I think he is a pretentious purveyor of obscurantism. <sssss> I read Wings of the Dove many years ago in the days when I would not allow myself to set aside books I did not enjoy. <sssss> I recently picked up a collection of his short stories and remembered why I disliked him so much. <sssss> Now in my old age I had no pangs of conscience when I happily closed the book before finishing it. <sssss> If more of the stories had been like Daisy Miller I would have proceeded further but unfortunately much of the writing reminded me of Wings. <sssss> I am currently seeking relief from Henry's turgid prose by reading Hemingway. <sssss> I'd trade in a Henry for an Ernie any day. <sssss> It's also difficult to like Mr. James' snobbish, shallow and unsympathetic characters. <sssss> The more sympathetic ones were obscured by his heavy hand and my impatience with his style.
N. Roscrea "Jurisfiction Agent"		Something Rotten: A Thursday Next Mystery: Books: Jasper Fforde		2		Once again, Jasper Fforde has created a story that is brilliantly written, perfectly blending English literature with wit. <sssss> The book continues the story of Thursday Next by creating a new conflict, as well as making connections with the previous Thursday Next novels, adding a deeper level to the reading. <sssss> Highly recommended reading, but I also recommend you read the series in order
hydro		Winter's Child: Books: Margaret Maron		1		I usually enjoy Ms. Maron's Deborah Knott books very much. <sssss> The characters are well drawn and give deep insight into Southern life. <sssss> This one, however, is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional. <sssss> The first murder doesn't seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just "there". <sssss> The second one involving Dwight's son (who is a very poorly developed child character) and his ex wife is not very interesting. <sssss> I devoutly hope this was the nadir of the series and it will improve after this. <sssss> Probably not, though-I foresee several storylines involving husband/stepmother/stepchild conflicts. <sssss> Glad I checked it out from the library and didn't purchase it outright..do the same and don't waste your money
shagadelic		Self-Reliance and Other Essays (Dover Thrift Editions): Books: Ralph Waldo Emerson		1		Not his best book,I Thought Waldo Lost in New York is more authoritive. <sssss> I mean who honestly belives that someone who is always lost can be trusted to help other people become self reliant, when he can't even rely on himself
L. Maynard		Monument: Books: Ian Graham		1		First I have to admit, I only read 150 pages of this book. <sssss> That was all I could possibly stand. <sssss> Life is just too short to waste on a book you don't enjoy reading. <sssss> Ballas, our main character, is a drunk and a scoundrel. <sssss> One is not sure whether they should root for or against him. <sssss> He is a vagrant, thief, and all around not so nice guy. <sssss> He steals a mysteriously beautiful gemstone, which sets into motion something........I got too bored to stick around and find out what. <sssss> The first 150 pages are filled with Ballas being beaten within an inch of his life, coming to, healing enough to move on, only to be beaten within an inch of his life again. <sssss> ok, we get it, let's get on with the story. <sssss> I just got too bored to stay with this one folks. <sssss> Maybe it got better, but to me, if an author can't write well enough to grab and maintain my attention, their book isn't worth my time. <sssss> There are too many great books out there. <sssss> Read this one at your own risk, if you can stay awake through it, that is
Concerned . . .		How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter: Books: Ann Coulter		1		It is sad that this is what passes for political commentary now. <sssss> Coulter's work demonstrates exactly the potential danger for degrading society and disdain for thinking that people like Ms. Coulter piously/hypocritically rail against. <sssss> She will happily take the same formula to the bank time and again. <sssss> Why must political discussion turn to childish name calling in order to convince self-selected audiences of something they already want to believe. <sssss> Pitiful rants here. <sssss> If you are in it for fun or don't care that you are getting a skewed, sensationalist opinion, maybe you should read a few paragraphs of this in the book store. <sssss> But for something better, why not go for an intelligent book that takes an even handed, analytical approach, rather than buy into the opinions of a new breed of political analyst (on both right and left) that race to produce the most extreme charactures of any political philosophy they do not happen to agree with.
David DeMaggio		Triumph: The Power and the Glory of the Catholic Church: Books: H. W. Crocker III		1		I received this book as a gift. <sssss> I was skeptical upon reading the praise for the book on the back cover from such political wonks as Bob Novak and Sean Hannity. <sssss> Haven't any well respected catholic theologians or scholars approved of this book? <sssss> No. <sssss> And with good reason. <sssss> It's not a history book, it's a poorly researched piece of garbage designed to bilk "the faithful" out of their hard-earned dollars. <sssss> I did read several chapters of the book to be fair. <sssss> When Crocker describes the Papal forces during the Albigensian crusade as "soldiers of God, overcoming all the odds to destroy the wicked oppression challenging the authority of the church." <sssss> I wanted to puke. <sssss> And how about the Inquisition, where Church authorities sanctioned physical torture against "heretics?" <sssss> Well, Crocker concedes that torturing someone might stray a little bit from Christ's original message of tolerance... but hey, they threatened the authority of the righteous Catholic church, so they got what they deserved. <sssss> Uh, yeah, amen brother. <sssss> These considerations aside, the book isn't even well researched, which immediately destroys its credibility with me. <sssss> For example from the Albigensian crusade, Crocker states that the armies of the heretics numbered over 100,000, yet with only a few thousand men, the Pope was able to defeat them, as they were filled with the "glory of god" or something like that. <sssss> Curiously, in his footnotes he cites nothing to back this claim up. <sssss> Maybe because it isn't true. <sssss> And any cites to books that have been critical of church policy, like, say, endorsing Mussolini, are derided as "unresearched," "politically motivated" and "shameful" Ironically, that's exactly what "Triumph" is to me
Linda Ward "mom of many"		Storm in the Night: Books: Mary Stolz,Pat Cummings		2		This book is execellent in explaining about fear and how to conquer it. <sssss> My f0ur children loved it
K. Geiger "geiger1971"		Wish You Well: Books: David Baldacci		2		I LOVED this story it was enriched with so many lessons, emotions, and detail that you felt like you were right there with Lous and Oz. <sssss> I would recommend this story to any one! <sssss> !
Joanne P. Buford		Betty Crocker's Easy Slow Cooker Dinners: Delicious Dinners the Whole Family Will Love (Betty Crocker): Books: Betty Crocker Editors		2		I was a little disappointed. <sssss> Maybe I should have shopped through a book store.
George R Dekle "Bob Dekle"		Crime and Punishment (Classic Fiction): Books: Fyodor Dostoyevsky		2		Raskolnikov, an impovershed student in 19th Century St. Petersburg, conceives a plan to kill and rob a shrewish hag of a pawnbroker. <sssss> He justifies his plan because he is an ubermensch and she is a louse. <sssss> The world will be better off if she is dead and he is able to finish his education. <sssss> Killing and robbing her will accomplish both purposes. <sssss> After all, the ubermensch owes it to society to commit any crime that will ultimately benefit society. <sssss> The crime is perpetrated and the rest of the book deals with Raskolnikov's angst over his guilt and his redemption through suffering. <sssss> Almost every major character in the book is more likeable that Raskolnikov. <sssss> The philosophy of Dostoyevsky's book seems to be primarily a refutation of Hegelian and proto-Nietschian philosophy and an affirmation of Christian values. <sssss> Along the way he also manages to work in a rebuttal of social-Darwinism. <sssss> Having known, prosecuted, and defended hundreds of murderers, I was much taken by Raskolnikov's psychological progression from crime to atonement. <sssss> Much of his self justification rang true to my experience. <sssss> I have known many killers who thought of themselves as superior beings above the law, and many others who justified killing on the grounds that the victim lacked human worth. <sssss> So long as the killer can keep the victim dehumanized, the killer can live with the deed. <sssss> When the killer begins to regard the victim as a fellow human, guilt sets in and many confess--often years later. <sssss> Raskolnikov's behavioural symptoms did not, however, ring true to my experience. <sssss> Although some killers are guilt-ridden to the point of distraction, they can usually control themselves much better than Raskolnikov. <sssss> His actions practically shouted his guilt. <sssss> The interplay of the large cast of characters gave the book great psychological depth, but Dostoyevsky didn't beat the reader over the head with the psychology. <sssss> He didn't tell you what the characters were thinking. <sssss> Their actions showed you what they were thinking. <sssss> In my experience, most modern psycho-dramas ladle out the psychology in huge dollops. <sssss> Modern writers would do well to re-read Dostoyevsky. <sssss> The abridged audio edition read by Michael Sheen is three hours long, and the tale does not suffer much from the massive abridgement necessary to get the story on three CD's. <sssss> My greatest complaint with the edition is that Sheen reads the story with a British accent, and the characters all speak with British accents. <sssss> It was somewhat hard to adjust to a Russian novel read with a British accent.
Laura Neulat		The Travels of Ibn Battuta: in the Near East, Asia and Africa, 1325-1354 (Dover Books on Travel, Adventure): Books: Ibn Battuta,Samuel Lee		2		Ibn Batuta describes his encounters with peoples and lands west of his native Tangiers (Morocco) in the 14 C. By avoiding to travel the same route twice, he comes to the same places a number of times (Baghdad, Delhi) spinning and zigzagging his ways through mountains and seas. <sssss> As he explores with brio this world, he unfolds himself and as in most cross-cultural encounters, this maybe one of the most interesting features of the book. <sssss> He accepts miraculous events with a candor I have not found in any other Middle Age traveler of those lands (from Marco Polo to the Jesuits). <sssss> He gives little description of the way people live in the places he visits - which I regret - apart from detailed descriptions of the gowns and other garments he is given by some of the Sheikhs of the places he visits. <sssss> The descriptions of how those sheikhs succeeded to govern illustrate how (extremely) fragile power was and is in those regions. <sssss> Names are sometimes difficult to relate to those we know - which is regretful. <sssss> Don't follow Ibn Batuta's advice, read (and enjoy) the book twice
		Diverse Druids: Books: Robert Baird		2		Robert Barid's exploration of history's secret connections is brilliant. <sssss> By integrating hidden and not presented in any other book various facts of sciences, he clearly shows that our ancestors had much deeper understanding of the Reality than most of the modern people. <sssss> I had a chance to explore many other books by this author available from his page on the World-Mysteries.com and I highly recommend all of them
Rachele Landers "Rachele"		A Map of the World (Oprah's Book Club): Books: Jane Hamilton		1		I find it very difficult to get through half of this book. <sssss> I have put it down and picked it up more times than I care to mention. <sssss> It is a waste of time. <sssss> Awful book..
"gracek312"		Do You Want to Know a Secret?: Books: Mary Jane Clark		2		I started the book last night, and couldn't put it down until 4 am, but at least I finished it! <sssss> It was a good storyline, I enjoyed getting a simple glimpse into the media world. <sssss> It also gives you a good peek into the corruption behind campaigns and politics in general. <sssss> I really liked the characters in this book, although each one, in my opinion, could have used some more depth. <sssss> The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because as you read it - you start to feel that the second half of the book pppppppppp lt;with extra emphasis on the last quarter of the book pppppppppp gt; was completely RUSHED. <sssss> I really don't like a sudden closing to a book. <sssss> However, it really does keep you guessing until the last couple of pages. <sssss> I just feel that it could have had MORE of an impact, and MORE of that pppppppppp quot;UMPH pppppppppp quot; had the story been written at the same speed throughout. <sssss> I do recommend this book for anyone who just wants a good book to read. <sssss> If you're looking for something you will remember for life - this isn't going to be it. <sssss> But if you're looking for a pleasant way to spend a nice afternoon - - - by all means, try reading Mary Jane Clark's pppppppppp quot;Do You...etc. <sssss> pppppppppp quot; Final word: I believe her mother-in-law, the OTHER Clark, would be quite proud of her ex-daughter in law. <sssss> The woman can write. <sssss> However, given her talents, I wish she would learn to write in her own style, instead of in the familiar style of the OTHER Clark
Mme Fairley "Sophie"		The Plot Against America: A Novel: Books: Philip Roth		2		This fiction of a plot against American Jews is very interesting. <sssss> It is well written and it holds your attention. <sssss> The little boy telling the story and the intricacy of politics attached to the story make this novel a book you cannot put aside. <sssss> This is about an era of American history, and it is well documented. <sssss> I recommend it to everyone: the older generation who lived thru it and particularly to the younger generation of people who are not familiar with this period; it teaches that history is constantly in the remake and cultural differences are still a problem in our world.
Lindy "Lindy"		Dark Watch: A Novel of the Oregon Files (Oregon Files (Audio)): Books: Clive Cussler,Jack Du Brul		1		As I read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by Mr. Cussler, the story was slow and the plot was transparent. <sssss> This book just didn't have the "zing" of the older Cussler stories. <sssss> If you are just laying around with nothing else to do it will give you something to read
Gandalf The Grey "Gandalf"		Man and His Symbols: Books: Carl Gustav Jung		2		This book was originally conceived of and designed in the manner of an illuminated manuscript. <sssss> The images are combined with the text to convey meaning. <sssss> In the paperback most of the images are gone and the ones remaining are converted to black and white and shoved into the middle of the book where they lose their context
Juliana Abakah-Katz "Ketchy"		Singing My Him Song: Books: Malachy McCourt		2		Vintage McCourt! <sssss> This is a good one but reminiscent of A Monk Swimming by the same author. <sssss> Mallachy McCourt is good, but I prefer his brother, Frank. <sssss> Poor man, I wonder how many times he has heard it. <sssss> But it takes nothing away from the book. <sssss> What genius of a family. <sssss> Poverty in childhood has turned out into prosperity for posterity. <sssss> Thanks McCourt Brothers
Jo York		The New Dare to Discipline: Books: James Dobson		1		Dobson has it wrong. <sssss> Children's susceptibility to God and the attributes of God has to do with rearing them with the love of God in their hearts from the beginning, praying and relying on God, and being taught to please God. <sssss> Violence begets violence. <sssss> To spank and be violent toward children is proof of the perpetrator's ignorance of modern scientific evidence that spanking is detrimental to the emotional, physical and spiritual evolution of children. <sssss> Ignorance begets ignorance, and if you're in charge of children, feeding your mind with ignorance is no benefit to your child
Jason Frost "Rubicon"		Firestarter (Signet): Books: Stephen King		2		Again... early King is the best King. <sssss> This book is so good you'll read it back to back
		Concepts of Modern Mathematics (Pelican S.): Books: Ian Stewart		2		If you want great mathematical puzzles, you buy a Terry Stickels puzzle book. <sssss> If you want to read about the universe from the world's best amateur mathematician and physicist, you read Martin Gardner. <sssss> If you want a professional's point of view of all the above, you read anything by Ian Stewart. <sssss> This is simply a must read for all clear thinking people
Doulawoman		Birth as an American Rite of Passage (Comparative Studies of Health Systems and Medical Care): Books: Robbie E. Davis-Floyd		2		If you really want to know what to expect when you're expecting, read this book and Henci Goer's Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth. <sssss> If you'd really like to remove yourself from the technobirth machine, read Ina May Gaskin's Ina May's Guide to Childbirth and Spiritual Midwifery. <sssss> If you've always thought you might want a natural birth, read Peggy O'Mara's Having a Baby, Naturally. <sssss> And remember this one thing: If you really (really) want a natural, unmedicated birth, don't give birth in a hospital
Harte C. Crow "History reader"		Duveen: A Life in Art: Books: Meryle Secrest		1		I held great hopes for this book--Duveen has long been of interest to me because of the pivotal role he played in the creation of some of the greatest art collections in this country. <sssss> However, Secrest in her drive to capture the "essence" of the man has so mangled the story of his life and career that reading her work is more chore than delight. <sssss> To say the book is disorganized is to deal in serious understatement. <sssss> But worse than that are the inaccuracies, especially when she writes about Duveen's customers. <sssss> Just for starters, apparently she didn't recognize the need to differentiate between John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his father (or maybe she didn't know there has been more than one JDR!). <sssss> You won't learn much from this tome that you don't know to begin, and getting through it will be a struggle.
Mrs. G. Pollock "balding red-faced sprog"		Figuring Jasper Johns (Essays in Art and Culture): Books: Fred Orton		1		I found this book to be pretentiously over complexified. <sssss> The relationship between object and surface has been aptly documented by many other art historians of the late 20thC. <sssss> I think that Fred has in this case over analysed too few works by the great artist, flag to me and many of the people I have discussed it with is far too complex a work for a man like Orton to even vaguely comment on critically. <sssss> He appears to my other academic associates and I to be slightly out of his depth at this level, and in future would do well to perhaps abandon the bottle of Gin which he is widely known to keep under his desk, and to consequently write something worthwhile and not liquer-induced. <sssss> Mr Orton, I am not your fan.
R. Camp		Sam Saboura's Real Style: Style Secrets for Real Women with Real Bodies: Books: Sam Saboura		1		Really not sure why this book received such good reviews, because it had nothing new. <sssss> Expected from the cover some reviews of outfits worn by different individuals pictured. <sssss> Very disappointed ... and any (and all) of the "what not to wear" books are so much better. <sssss> Oh, Sam, did mention it's better to hand wash cashmere, oh yeah, I already know that.
JPGRfan "Alex"		Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies, 15e: The 15th Edition of the Bestselling Encyclopedia of Film, Actors, Directors, Producers, and Writers (Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies): Books: Leslie Halliwell		2		There is no way, you should limit yourself to just one source, this book is a second source book,(Maybe even third source). <sssss> That said, It's great for looking up names, (there is a lot listed) For finding names that may not be household, then looking at better sources for more info. <sssss> There is no book that has everything, every name, every movie star, if so, it costs 500.00 or the book weighs about 10 pounds. <sssss> You don't want to buy a library? <sssss> ok, then, it's ok by itself, its fun by itself, to just do browsing, almost, (but its not) a coffee table book. <sssss> It works well with other book sources, to check, and maybe another source will prove it wrong, or "Who's Who" proves the other book wrong, when double checking. <sssss> I didn't find loads of errors in here, a few, the biggest problem (as others mentioned) is very brief or not complete career lists, movies or TV they did is not complete. <sssss> It's not a great book, it's a great second source book, a double check or name finder book, for movie and TV stars. <sssss> At a fair price, it should be in your collection just for the reasons I mentioned. <sssss> Buy it? <sssss> yes, buy it
K. B. Brown "reader, knitter, swimmer, yogini"		The Fencing Master: Books: Arturo Perez-Reverte		2		If I were to choose the two best novels by this author, they would be The Nautical Chart and The Queen of the South. <sssss> The Fencing Master, by comparison, isn't as lively or as intellectually thrilling -- but it is a chewy read. <sssss> I particularly loved the characterization of Don Jaime as an older man realizing what he has lost in his life.
Jill Schaumloeffel		The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy: Books: Thomas J. Stanley,Thomas J. Stanley Ph. D,William D. Danko Ph.D		2		I borrowed this book on CD from the library and half way through, ordered the book so I would have it to refer to. <sssss> Excellent book, highly recommended. <sssss> Helps to put a realistic perspective on millionaires
Alan T. August		Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life (Audio Editions): Books: Anne Lamott		2		The big gift that the present public school system bestows upon most of us is a giant inferiority complex. <sssss> Few of us ever wake up to the mental prison-cells that society has put us in and fewer still escape. <sssss> Anne Lamott's book is one of those that not only encourages people but shows them how to let go of their perfectionism and internal critic and all the other fears and ego traps that keep us from creating. <sssss> Once you get past this junk, you begin to see you don't really need books telling you how to write at all. <sssss> You just need to write.
Art Lover		Love Letters, Lost: Books: Babbette Hines		2		Another beautiful contribution by this author. <sssss> Love letters to make you weep, smile, laugh and imagine . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> or remember . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> how it feels to love and be loved
Jason J Hyatt		Cooking The Dutch Oven Way, 3rd Edition: Books: Jane Woodruff		2		Overall this book is just fine for someone interested in cooking with a DO. <sssss> The mix of recipes is fine, but they just seemed to be missing something. <sssss> They were all more or less of the pppppppppp quot;huck a good sized hen into the pot and cook for a while until done pppppppppp quot; variety. <sssss> All of the recipes look tasty, though I would have liked to have seen a few more meat dishes, especially some more creative ones. <sssss> Let's be honest, when you pay for a book you'd like to see more than pppppppppp quot;...put a 5 lb beef roast into a preheated Dutch oven, salt and pepper to taste, cook until done. <sssss> pppppppppp quot; Give me a little something to work with here! <sssss> Inspire me! <sssss> I can already cook a roast like this in the oven. <sssss> Having said all of that, I would still reccommend this book. <sssss> The vegetable dishes and desserts look fantastic and I can't wait to try some of them. <sssss> As an aside, this is the only Dutch oven book I've seen with heart-healthy recipes as well as more traditional fare. <sssss> Given that the average DO book requires the use of a metric ton of lard, this will probably appeal to a wider range of cooks
Snowbrocade		Voyager: Books: Diana Gabaldon		2		Book number three in the Outlander trilogy, the fantasy historical romance of the time traveling Claire Fraser, has Claire re-unite with her 18th century husband, Jamie, who she left before the battle of Culloden in Dragonfly in Amber. <sssss> A time travel trip through the stones is once more necessary and Claire has to leave her beloved daughter Brianna behind. <sssss> This trip is successful and Claire is now plunged into the complicated life of Jamie, who has survived the battle but now is dealing with the post-uprising difficulties of the Scottish. <sssss> While Claire is involved with the difficulties of her re-union with Jamie, there is also a series of mysterious and violent murders in Edinborough, and the kidnapping of Jamie's nephew. <sssss> Claire and Jamie sail the high seas and encounter pirates, voodoo and slave uprisings in the Caribbean. <sssss> This colorful third installment in the series at times seems like it tries a little too hard to have Claire and Jamie caught up in every possible adventure of the time period. <sssss> Nevertheless the foundation of the solid characters created and nurtured by Gabaldan weather the slightly torrid escapades of this timeless romantic couple. <sssss> One of the new characters is a bit flimsy and caricatured; the giggling, bouncy, foot-worshipping Chinaman Mr. Willoughby. <sssss> Although he later proves to be more substantial than his intial portrayal, the appearance of this character is contrived and jarring. <sssss> A note I think the story would have been better without. <sssss> Despite its flaws, Voyager continues the thread of a passionate romance and fascinating premise. <sssss> The time travel fantasy is portrayed well--in particular the notion of what one would bring back to the 18th century if all you could carry was in your pockets. <sssss> Combining historical romance and fantasy was a genius stroke that makes this series of continuing interest. <sssss> Gabaldon's superior narrative, likeable characters and excellent research continue and keep her audience hooked. <sssss> In light of the inherent difficulty of maintaining reader interest in a character and premise over three books, this is a highly sucessful sequel.
Elephantschild "Chris"		Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print): Books: Daniel Goleman		2		There is about as much additional science in Social Intelligence, compared to Emotional Intelligence, as you could write on a postcard : mirror neurones and spindle cells. <sssss> Nevertheless, we can be thankful that Daniel Goleman chose to pay his tax bills this way. <sssss> Firstly, it serves to bring back the lessons of the earlier book to best-seller awareness, which is goodness. <sssss> Secondly, it re-casts them more clearly in an inter-personal format. <sssss> Note that this already existed in Emotional Intelligence, but was not so clearly called out. <sssss> The most positive aspect is the confirmation provided by fMRI studies to previous empirical or intuitive knowledge on the importance of inter-personal relationships to psychic ecology. <sssss> A question-mark would be against the reliance on Seligman's and Csikszentmihalyi's questionnaire based results. <sssss> Questionnaire psychology is frustratingly limited in the gap between the suggestive nature of the results and the impossibilty of distinguishing between correlation and cause-effect
enya1978		Bridget Jones's Diary: Books: Helen Fielding		2		After seeing the movie, I decided to pick up the book. <sssss> This book proved to be very funny, as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many, many women her age face today. <sssss> Fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true, often serious real-life topics (being single and not liking it, infidelity, betrayal)and is yet able turn it into light, funny reading. <sssss> That takes talent, in my book. <sssss> In the wrong hands, this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read(in light of the above topics). <sssss> You cant help but root for Bridget. <sssss> I recommend this book and its sequel. <sssss> Most everyone will get a good laugh out of it
peter		Gods and Generals: Books: Jeff Shaara		1		i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book, the killer angels. <sssss> it is not fair to compare the two, but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one, i thought i should mention it. <sssss> this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book. <sssss> it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg, so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle. <sssss> but the result is a less satisfying book. <sssss> it skims rather than digs deep
M. Packo		Blade Runner (Bfi Modern Classics): Books: Scott Bukatman		1		Replicant Alert! <sssss> Avoid this book if you have any affection for the movie. <sssss> Except for the last couple of pages, the author has little to offer other than the usual drivel about pppppppppp quot;Post-Modernism pppppppppp quot;. <sssss> You will be much better off buying the Director's Cut on DVD, and watching it several times! <sssss> This series of books has its exceptions, this is not one of them. <sssss> Unintentionally hilarious in parts, as only the academician can be. <sssss> Pretentious, ponderous cinema-scholar jargon that offers little of value or insight. <sssss> Read Sammon's The Making of Blade Runner instead! <sssss> (Nice cover, though...
B. Long "Mother of Three Sons"		It's a Boy: Women Writers on Raising Sons: Books: Andrea J. Buchanan		2		When I saw the cover of this book, I had a feeling I would love it. <sssss> The picture of the little boy on the cover flexing his muscles is something I have seen my three sons do many, many times. <sssss> When I opened it and started to read, wonderful memories flooded back of when my sons were younger. <sssss> I laughed and cried almost simultaneously while reading several of the stories. <sssss> If you have sons, or have friends that have sons, this book is a must. <sssss> I will be buying my friends who are mothers of sons this for Christmas
R. L. Stites		Fire in the Fireplace: Charismatic Renewal in the Nineties: Books: Charles E. Hummel		2		We would expect a well balanced approach to writing about the work of the Holy Spirit in the church by the author who also wrote "Tyranny of the Urgent" and we get it! <sssss> In this book, Charles E. Hummel, former president of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, first reviews the history and growth of the various Charismatic groups within both the protestant and Catholic churches. <sssss> He provides many valuable explanations of the meaning of related scriptures as well as observations of healings and prophecies that he himself has seen. <sssss> He later gives his recommendations for keeping the Holy Spirit "fire in the fireplace" of a biblical church body. <sssss> I came away encouraged in my own Spiritual gifts and reminded that the more extraordinary Spirit gifts have not disappeared and that "to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
S. Rems "lonelyzephyr83"		Blessings: Books: Anna Quindlen		2		I found this novel at a bookstore on the boardwalk I visit at least once every summer. <sssss> I love going there and looking to see if I can find a book that I have never heard of, by an author I've never heard of, and buy it on a whim. <sssss> This is the novel I bought last year. <sssss> I has, unfortunately, sat on my shelf since then until tonight, because of many reasons. <sssss> Tonight, however, I picked it up and read it cover to cover. <sssss> The narrative was brilliantly told, the dialogue completely believable and the plot totally heartwrenching. <sssss> If I had made it to the end without some tears, I would believe myself made of stone! <sssss> Skip is a character many can relate to: a man unsatisfied with how his life has turned out, down about how his friends have really not been friends at all, that gets the chance to do something great by this little child. <sssss> However, it is the change she makes in those around her which are truly the BLESSINGS of the title. <sssss> Faith, a name not used lightly, restores her namesake in all those touched by her. <sssss> She ultimately gives him the chance of making something of his life without even knowing it. <sssss> Many BLESSINGS occur in this wonderful novel, and I found myself all at once sour about how humankind can be at times, but also proud at how humankind can be at others (which is a fact, in itself, that proves how well Quindlen has spun her tale). <sssss> The fact is that just because a person has been to jail, has deadbeat friends, does not mean he is of that same stock; just because an elderly woman has become so dragged down by her own life does not mean she has no feeling left in her. <sssss> Skip, Lydia, Nadine, Meredith, Jennifer...all have many dimentions to their characters that Quindlen has spectacularly drawn
Matthew Ramirez		China Inc.: How the Rise of the Next Superpower Challenges America and the World: Books: Alan Sklar		2		The book was very well writtem with great information on the amazing economy of China. <sssss> The book is a must read for anyone interested in business or economy fields.
Harriet M Welsch		Captains Courageous (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio)): Books: Rudyard Kipling,David Stuart		1		Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today. <sssss> Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page. <sssss> Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner "We're Here," which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of. <sssss> My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, "Honey, I see what you mean." <sssss> One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense. <sssss> For example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" <sssss> his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown. <sssss> Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy. <sssss> Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows. <sssss> Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night. <sssss> Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?" <sssss> I got my B.A. <sssss> in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's "Ulysses" than an unannotated version of this book. <sssss> So why did I bother? <sssss> A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving. <sssss> The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me. <sssss> But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever! <sssss> (Let them read "Cannery Row" instead!)
Don Rhodes		DVD Authoring and Production: Books: Ralph LaBarge		2		This book shows you in an easy to read format the true capabilities of the DVD format and what is required to do it. <sssss> It helped me in being able to ask intelligent questions when purchasing equipment
Hans-Christoph Hobohm		The Organization of Information: Second Edition (Library and Information Science Text Series): Books: Arlene G. Taylor		2		I used this book for an introductory lesson on descriptive cataloguing in library, archival and information science. <sssss> It worked very well for giving an overview of the problems in just this interdisciplinary approach. <sssss> A lot of examples are given and explained in an understandable way. <sssss> There are some reduncancies but this helps for the understanding
Catherine M. Walters "Fond of Amazon"		The Raw Food Detox Diet: The Five-Step Plan for Vibrant Health and Maximum Weight Loss: Books: Natalia Rose		2		I found this book to very informative. <sssss> In a nutshell, it tells you how food is processed throughout your system and it's reaction. <sssss> Like, fresh vegatables can be eaten with anything but starches don't digest well with meat. <sssss> There are stages to going *Raw* that Ms. Rose has honestly and clearly put out there. <sssss> Our bodies just can't go Raw over night. <sssss> Yhere is a change in the digestive system. <sssss> I know from my experience how my body feels when I eat raw for several days and then introduce the wrong combonation of foods. <sssss> I feel like I'm suffering at the toilet.Sorry. <sssss> Natalie gets you through the stages of developing this life style. <sssss> It's a Detox program not a cookbook. <sssss> It has recipes for all the stages to going *Raw. <sssss> Ms. Rose hershelf claims it took several years for her to go completely Raw. <sssss> The recipes are for those various stages. <sssss> I don't find anything wrong with this book. <sssss> As far as enzymes. <sssss> All foods have them, and yes our body has them too. <sssss> When cooking foods you are breaking down the enzymes that are packed with nutrients. <sssss> That simple. <sssss> We want to incorporate more enzymes or natural living food into our bodies. <sssss> And if you read your Bible...you will know what it means to eat pure food. <sssss> Eat what the Lord has provided for you. <sssss> You best optimal health can continue and grow from eating more living foods. <sssss> I was on this plan for a month. <sssss> Without exercise I did the stage 3 and followed through the evening. <sssss> I lost 16lbs in a month! <sssss> I didn't even do an enema yet. <sssss> My body was doing well everyday several times a day getting rid of the waste I've manage to occumalate. <sssss> I didn'want to wear my food anymore. <sssss> My insulin was way off from process snacks. <sssss> This really help me feel the difference and pay respect to the best thing I could have done for myself. <sssss> This book is a great beginning. <sssss> I hope you see it the way I do
Abbey R. Ehman "Always learning"		The HOME House Project: The Future of Affordable Housing: Books: Steve Badanes,David J. Brown,Ben Nicholson,Michael Sorkin		1		Although interesting, these are designs and concepts that are not practical in the real world. <sssss> But, if all you want are some pretty pictures..
Khyie Sanct		My Father's Scar: Books: Michael Cart		2		I read a lot of books about gay guys, girls, ect. <sssss> but never have I picked up one that touched so well on the subject of homophobia. <sssss> It's a simple enough story to read, compared to some other gay authors but it touches extremely well on problems that one can encounter growing up, first with weight, then intelligence, then being gay. <sssss> I couldn't put it down after the first chapter
femme4femme		Swimming Sweet Arrow : A Novel: Books: Maureen Gibbon		1		I bought this book because it was listed with Ellen Miller's Like Being Killed, a brilliant and complex book about a woman's love affair with heroin, her best friend Susie, and her best friend's duplicitous HIV positive boyfriend. <sssss> The protagonist herself was brilliant and complex. <sssss> So naturally, I expected the same thing out of Swimming Sweet Arrow. <sssss> Man, was I disappointed. <sssss> This was yet another trashy tale about a pathetic woman's masochistic sex life, pathetic obsession with brutal men, and pathetic quest for attention. <sssss> Her entire life is a meta-existence: rather than desiring, she desires to be desired. <sssss> Rather than enjoying, she enjoys being enjoyed. <sssss> The male characters and the female characters are written by someone who has never met a male or female who didn't exhibit the most common stereotypes; in her world, all men are sensation-craving brutes, and all women are attention-craving doormats. <sssss> The men want drugs, fun, and sex, and the women whine and cry and enjoy nothing--not the drugs, not the sex, just being a victim due to the attention it provides. <sssss> This book made me really miserable to be perceived as part of this gender.
catherine m. kelley "catherine399"		Chased By The Light: Books: Jim Brandenburg		1		While it is true that Brandenburg is a tremendous photographer and the majority of photos are simply breathtaking. <sssss> I returned my copy because the datebook also contained disturbing photos of dead wildlife. <sssss> I'm very tender when it comes to wildlife, and while I know that death is a natural part of the life cycle, I am disturbed by dead wildlife and would never chose a book or datebook containing such pictures. <sssss> For anyone who is animal sensitive and dislikes any death photos, then this IS NOT the book for them. <sssss> Otherwise, I would recommend it
T. Loncao		In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah): Books: Deborah Crombie		2		I thought that the two books previous to this in the Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James series were slight disappointments. <sssss> Kincaid seemed relegated to a side character with Gemma taking the lead. <sssss> IN A DARK HOUSE is an excellent mystery that brings the two back to equal ground and re-establishes them as one of the best partnerships in mystery fiction
Oz Survivor "Oz Survivor"		What's the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America: Books: Thomas Frank		1		I've always been a big believer in "attack the message" (if you don't agree), don't attack the messenger. <sssss> The reverse has been almost standard practice of the Left when they can't refute the truth, facts and common sense of conservatives. <sssss> Which is close to 100% of the time. <sssss> So I have to be very careful not to copy the Left when I write as a fifth generation Kansan and having lived all of my life, thus far, in the same "upper-middle class" suburb Mr. Frank seems to so despise in his first and only book. <sssss> But his book was so filled with errors, personal opinions disguised as facts and mislabeling of events, people and general culture, as to make it a book of fiction; not one of fact. <sssss> He stated himself he had every advantage presented to him early in life but he chose not to take advantage of them. <sssss> He relishes being a victim and seems to mostly be upset that he wasn't born into a poor family of migrant laborers. <sssss> Perhaps born as Ms. Condoleezza Rice? <sssss> She is certainly a good example of someone held down by evil conservatives and not permitted to excel in life (not). <sssss> Living in, and exposed to, the surroundings of his childhood, it appears to me his life's goal was to become a professional victim and a loser in life where the deck is stacked against you from birth. <sssss> He's, so far, at least succeeding in that! <sssss> Being an accomplished loser. <sssss> What a goal! <sssss> His only "accomplishment" was the writing of one book that could only be believed as fact by disciples of The DailyKOS. <sssss> Having written his fictional book of what life is NOT like in Johnson County, Kansas and how he was stopped cold at every turn of life's losing lottery, he really has nothing else to say. <sssss> Perhaps he can now survive as an invention of the Left writing the same type of fiction over and over (as he just did for the NY Times). <sssss> He must be a very unhappy person. <sssss> It seems most liberals are. <sssss> How sad. <sssss> The only real obstacle they have in life is seen in their mirror each morning. <sssss> That's it no matter how much they deny reality. <sssss> He seems like an intelligent young man who had everything going for him. <sssss> What a waste of talent. <sssss> Now, he's just another "victim" doing his best to convince everyone else they too should just give up as they can't win in life no matter how hard they try. <sssss> As I intimated, I'm sure glad Condoleezza Rice ignored people like him! <sssss> I just wish people like him were fewer in number and that more ignored their delusional vision of reality. <sssss> Checking in from Kansas, he is a "one book wonder".
Edmond Gauthier		The United States of Wal-Mart: Books: John Dicker		1		Oh, yes - this is a very fine book... for me to poop on! <sssss> In other words, it's a JOKE book. <sssss> It's just another one of a half dozen duds out there, all trying to slam whoever happens to be the #1 retailer at the time - this decade it's Wal-Mart. <sssss> Foreign countries paying their workers less? <sssss> Blame Wal-Mart! <sssss> Worker insurance prices going sky high because the medical industry over-estimates it's fees? <sssss> Blame Wal-Mart! <sssss> Crooked unions feeling threatened they'll get their butts kicked by non-union competition? <sssss> Blame Wal-Mart! <sssss> Etc., etc. <sssss> You just have to laugh at how these semi-journalistic schlockmeisters try so desperately to compare themselves to a real activist like Micheal Moore, who actually accomplishes some social good once in awhile. <sssss> But you know who's REALLY laughing? <sssss> That's right - Wal-Mart. <sssss> That's because they've ALREADY built their thousands of stores, and been in business for over 40 years, so it's way too late now for these mealy-mouthed media wannabes to do anything about it! <sssss> And what do these ersatz authors expect at this very late date, anyway? <sssss> That millions of consumers, during these roller-coaster economic times, will be instantly brainwashed by these new crackpot books and then suddenly start to "boycott lower prices"? <sssss> Ha! <sssss> Ha! <sssss> Ha! <sssss> Like I said, this has got to be just another joke book
Ronmattoo		Sacred Stone (Oregon Files (Paperback)): Books: Clive Cussler,Craig Dirgo		1		Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. <sssss> The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. <sssss> That is perfectly justified! <sssss> The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. <sssss> This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. <sssss> How come "Hickman" is not a "Christian" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. <sssss> The justifications are ridiculous. <sssss> India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. <sssss> You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. <sssss> We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. <sssss> The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs
Aage J. Barlund "AJB"		Complete Origami: An A-Z facts and folds, with step-by-step instructions for over 100 projects: Books: Eric Kenneway		2		I bought this book to learn some simple things to fold in a Kindergarten I used to work in, and it was an instant success! <sssss> I was sat at the table for hours folding frogs and boats to the kids, and they seemed to really enjoy the creations! <sssss> This is a great book for parents and pre-school teachers, and it is a great way to learn a little bit about geometry too. <sssss> Some of the models are difficult to understand, but folding is about taking your time. <sssss> A great way of finding a corner of peace in our rush-hour lifestyle
"fishstickbreath"		Darby: Books: Jonathon Scott Fuqua		2		All right... All right, I say. <sssss> So I'm writing about a preteen book about a little girl. <sssss> That doesn't make me weird does it? <sssss> It shouldn't since I had to read it for a college course. <sssss> So I'm writing because, well, who would've ever guessed, but I loved it? <sssss> It's a ripping story, man. <sssss> It is funny, inventive, historic and riveting, all the things I was sure it wouldn't be when I got assigned the book. <sssss> So, here I am, blown away by a book about a little girl. <sssss> I don't even like history, but it wasn't presented as antiquated. <sssss> It was dealt with as you and I would deal with our history, as pertinent, in the moment, and nothing that has been generated and worked over in a history book. <sssss> I'm telling you, the character Darby is great, as are all the characters, including the total garps that go around spouting their racist jargon, etc, until Darby unintentionally questions everything, causing all matter of problems, like maybe she'll get knocked off by the Klan. <sssss> The story is actually something you'll find yourself absolutely focused on. <sssss> I couldn't put it down. <sssss> I've read a lot of adolescent fiction for this class, and I can say that if I had a kid, I'd be pouring this down their brain. <sssss> So, does that make me weird? <sssss> Who cares, huh? <sssss> I had to read the book for my class, and I'm happy I did
Michael LaRocca "http://www.chinarice.org"		The Summons: Books: John Grisham,Michael Beck		1		When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. <sssss> For that book, certainly. <sssss> For this one, nope. <sssss> I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. <sssss> I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable.
M. Ollila		Beauty to Die for: The Cosmetic Consequence: Books: Judi Vance		1		I bought this book thinking that I would learn something new about the cosmetic industry. <sssss> Not only did I not learn anything, I came away from the book wondering just how someone could've accumulated all of that information without being able to present it in a better way. <sssss> This book is packed with non-scientific fluff (using ill-defined terms such as "toxin" and making blanket statements with no evidence such as "Scientists involved [sic] mechanical science--as I like to call it--do not understand plant science, but scientists, who know plant science, understand both [grammar and punctuation left exactly as in the book].") <sssss> About 60% of the book is packed with charts and glossaries. <sssss> And I have to say that this is the worst-edited book I have ever read, with constant typographical errors, misspellings, and apostrophe problems. <sssss> There just doesn't seem to have been a lot of thought put into the actual execution of this book. <sssss> Look, I am certainly this book's target audience--I shop at Whole Foods, use organic skin-care products and potions, and work out six times a week. <sssss> I care about my body and what I put into it. <sssss> But this book is not a good use of anyone's time or money, as all of its information can be found quite easily (and in most cases with better grammar) on the internet. <sssss> You're better off buying _Fast Food Nation_ if you'd like clear, concise information about what you're putting into your body
Black Griffin "blackgriffin"		The Constant Princess: Books: Philippa Gregory		1		"The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. <sssss> They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. <sssss> So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. <sssss> "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. <sssss> One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. <sssss> Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. <sssss> That may or may not be the case with Gregory. <sssss> I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. <sssss> The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. <sssss> So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. <sssss> They feel forced, constructed. <sssss> I'm going back to Trollope
klownboy "klownboy"		State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration: Books: James Risen		1		Don't sell it to one country on microfilm for a lot of money, sell it to everybody in hard cover for ~$20.00 a pop. <sssss> Somebody is going to have to explain to me the difference between what Risen has done here, and what the Walkers were imprisoned for. <sssss> Imagine a WWII era reporter, during the war, giving away that the Allies had broken the Kreigsmarine Enigma code in order to challenge how much money was spent doing it; or how we used false signals to test Japanese intentions in the run-up to Midway just to question whether we correctly evaluated the information; or disclosed the exact D-day landing beaches in a vain attempt to substitute their own "expert" opinion. <sssss> James Risen's product is the same thing, only with a snarkier Monday-morning-quarterback vibe. <sssss> And when hindsight is your only insight, you know you're in trouble. <sssss> It's easy to figure out who had it right on intelligence issues a few years down the line, even easier to find the "I-told-you-so heroes" eager to tell their tales of cassandrian victimization. <sssss> And that's really all State of War does. <sssss> It collects a pile of disconnected (often single-sourced and anonymous) anecdotes, and fleshes them out. <sssss> The more interesting the story, the more questionably it's sourced, and the fuller its fleshed. <sssss> In the end, it's a bloated yet vacuous work that discloses sensitive specifics in order to illustrate a few widely known and obvious generalities, those being: Intelligence gathering isn't perfect. <sssss> Mistakes are often made. <sssss> Present laws do not keep up with technology. <sssss> (Just in case you didn't know that already) If you're hoping for an across the board Bush slam, think twice. <sssss> There's info on botched Clinton-era operations as well (one of which transferred nuclear weapons technology to one of our favorite Mid-East regimes), but again, why? <sssss> What's worse, the specifics in the book have given terrorists valuable intelligence without giving anyone else anything usable (Unless cocktail party whining is a "use"). <sssss> In the wake of this book and the politically-motivated NY Times story, the bad guys have already started altering how they do their communications. <sssss> Great news for American civilians and military members alike. <sssss> This book might have a place 10-20 years down the line. <sssss> But as it stands, during an active shooting war, a valuable, effective, and completely legal intelligence gathering tool (a tool Clinton used with "0" congressional oversight) is revealed and disabled so that James Risen can buy a boat. <sssss> Another triumph of American journalism!
Jennifer Swaylik		Miracle: Books: Danielle Steel		1		I am soooo tired of Danielle Steel's books. <sssss> They have lost all of the originality with which she used to write. <sssss> Every book now has the same story line just different names for the characters. <sssss> BORING! <sssss> What happened to the good stuff - Thurston House, Ghost, Kaliedescope ........ <sssss> I had stopped reading her books because I have been sick of the same old thing - I borrowed Miracle from a friend hoping it would indeed be a miracle and would be original Danielle Steel -I was completely wrong. <sssss> I would guess her writing is suffering because she pumps out 2 to 3 books a year. <sssss> Danielle if you are reading this (and I hope she is) PLEASE give us back something great to read - Quality instead of Quantity! <sssss> Until then I won't be buying or borrowing any more of her books.
skell		Dawn: Books: Elie Wiesel		1		Dawn written by Elie Wiesel is a story about two men who are meant to be killed at the same time, at dawn. <sssss> David Ben Moshe is Jewish and will be killed by the English at the same time as Elisha; a Jewish man will kill an English man John Dawson.Elisha and his friends wait all night for dawn, the book takes place with them in one room, thinking about what they have to do, they have little conversation between each other. <sssss> I did not find the book Dawn very interesting,I found it to move very slow, because Elisha and his friends stayed in one room during the whole story, and while one man was thinking about what he should do or how he felt, the reader did not know how the other people where feeling at that time. <sssss> The part I found the most interesting was when there would be conversation between Elisha and his friends, especially when they talked about their pasts, which was one of my favorite parts of the book, it was interesting because there was more action happening when they when explaining their past. <sssss> Although I found this book boring for the most part it was very descriptive and therefore I would recommend it to anyone who likes very descriptive books.
Femi		Wide Angle: National Geographic Greatest Places: Books: Ferdinand Protzman		1		...essentially you get what you pay for. <sssss> This book is certanly NOT representative of what I have come to expect from National Geographic. <sssss> I had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book, but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best. <sssss> Most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish. <sssss> In the past I've found photographs by professionals like Steve McCurry ('Portraits')visually arresting. <sssss> Not so here. <sssss> At least it only cost me $20 oredering from Amazon. <sssss> If I had been able to preview it beforehand, I would not have thought it worth even the discounted price
Cavan Terrill		Slow River: Books: Nicola Griffith		2		I was surprised at some of the poor reviews given this book and have an idea that these stem from those picking up books from a list of Nebula Award winners. <sssss> This book is not at all your typical SF story, indeed it feels much more like a mainstream story with some SF aspects than it does an SF story. <sssss> I'm an avid reader of both science fiction as well as mainstream fiction, so this holds a good deal of appeal for me. <sssss> Griffith's prose is wonderful and showcases a beauty of language seldom seen in science fiction. <sssss> Her characterization is also near perfect. <sssss> I won't spend time discussing the plot as that's been handled amply by the other reviewers, but I will echo one other person's thoughts: The storyline that has Lore working at a sewage plant is, surprisingly, every bit as engrossing as the ones that deal with her kidnapping and her high society upbringing. <sssss> To me, that says a good deal about Griffith's talent as a writer. <sssss> As for the sex scenes, which some people describe as being nearly constant in the book, there are actually about four or five scenes taking up somewhere around ten pages of the book (not each, but in total). <sssss> Additionally, they're not placed in the story without purpose. <sssss> Overall, an excellent book. <sssss> Personally, I'm quite glad that it won a Nebula. <sssss> It's certainly desereving
Katherine Briggs		The Whole World Over: A Novel: Books: Julia Glass		1		If Julia Glass had not set the bar so high with Three Junes, I would have given the book 3 stars instead of 2. <sssss> There are sentences, paragraphs, even pages of brilliance in this book, but it is as if winning the National Book Award gave Ms. Glass unconditional confidence in her writing, and character development in particular. <sssss> She seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around. <sssss> As another reviewer wrote, the writing process seemed transparant. <sssss> Reading the book, you get the feeling that the characters are what Ms. Glass (a privileged white woman of a certain age) imagines teenagers, or New Mexicans, or black chauffeurs, or Hispanic nannies, or even gay people to be like. <sssss> She is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them. <sssss> The teenagers and the Santa Fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures. <sssss> Greenie might be the most believable, and although I understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy Alan, I wasn't sucked along with her when she falls in love with "the other Charlie". <sssss> He was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth (even temporarily) losing your child over. <sssss> With Saga, she manages to develop her most sympathetic character, but Saga's life is left floating and unresolved at the end. <sssss> Even the brief appearance of Fenno, who I loved in Three Junes, lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky. <sssss> All and all, a very disappointing second novel. <sssss> You have to wonder, since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character, what good is her editor?
Thierry Fossemalle "thierry"		The Easy Way to Stop Smoking (Penguin Health Care pppppppppp Fitness): Books: Allen Carr		2		If you wanna stop smoking then give this a go. <sssss> You'll either stop right away or you'll never beleive your doomed to puff on for life . <sssss> Either way you win. <sssss> strange thing to say about a book but true i say. <sssss> Amazing stuff.
Sammy		Kant: Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy): Books: Immanuel Kant,Mary J. Gregor,Christine M. Korsgaard		2		Immanuel Kant is truly one of the most influential moral philosophers in history; and with this book, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, he positioned himself far further. <sssss> In this book you will find things to be deeply contemplated, about "good will", the moral value of conduct and its metaphysical aspects. <sssss> This translation of the Kant's original Grundlegung von Metaphysik der Sitten to English is quiet easy to understand, so it is relatively an easy-reading book
Nahuel Ricardo Garavaglia		Ultimate V-Twin Motorcycle Chassis: Forks, Shocks, Brakes, Wheels and Tires: Books: Tim Remus		1		I have read this book only once time, it tooks me about 1 hour, It is very basic, have not any important info, else that you can get from a free catalo
Richard DiCanio "The Torpedo in a Tuxedo"		Dry: A Memoir: Books: Augusten Burroughs		2		Dry is anything but what the title of this work implies.The pages drip with boozy escapades and one can almost smell and taste the liquor on Augusten Burroughs breath.A must for drinkers who would like to stop or at least reassess what the heck is going on in their lives.Almost motivational in its honest appraisal of the difficulties inherent in this addiction. <sssss> The writing style is clear and refreshingly down to earth,funny, yet foreboding and diary-like in its presentation.Burroughs clearly transmits via humor and self awareness the many dimensions of this destructive addiction and the problems that can come with it, especially the limited usefulness of rehab.The story itself is pretty hip with a good look inside the mind of what we could easily call, "a hard core drinker" as he anticipates the "next one".Passages describe a variety of interpersonal dilemmas,job and sexual conundrums.Dry is also a good insightful look at how the treatees view the treaters and how quickly they can size up weaknesses and exploit them.This is a page turner but it does drag a bit in the middle, yet has a strong finish.An earlier work 'Running With Scissors' was apparently good enough for Hollywood, so take a shot with DRY.After all, when your liquor bottles occupy more living space in your place than you do, it might be time to slow down,stop and get a copy of Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, and a copy of Dry. <sssss> CHEERS! <sssss> !
Ibel Seffner, Jr.		The 5 Keys to Value Investing: Books: J. Dennis Jean-Jacques		2		I got my copy of pppppppppp quot;The Five Keys to Value Investing pppppppppp quot; as a graduation gift from my dad who is a longtime professional equities investor. <sssss> He thought this book would be a good way for me to prep before I start my career on Wall Street. <sssss> I was not disappointed. <sssss> The Five Keys is a very good summary of what I learned in business school and much, much more. <sssss> The author draws heavily from his own professional experiences as a disciple of one legendary value investor and couples it with the value investment styles of other great investors like Buffett and Graham. <sssss> The experience that the reader is drawn into is very worthwhile; but what makes this book very special is the framework. <sssss> I have read several investment books over the years, but none like this one. <sssss> Putting thousands of lessons and teachings of prominent value investors into a solid frame of mind is clearly the draw. <sssss> In addition, reading along as the author analyzes and dissects companies and few special situations add gravitas to the body of work. <sssss> The clarity in the concepts and the "conversation-like" tone was particularly attractive to me. <sssss> In sum, this is a very coherent, practical book on the principles of value investing despite the fact that it is not too objective -- considering the authors' strong unapologetic bias towards value investing
The Painless		Sacred Stone (Oregon Files (Paperback)): Books: Clive Cussler,Craig Dirgo		1		The storyline is way over-the-top, the plot is very poor, the red-neck-America-knows-best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying. <sssss> Still, I've red worse books. <sssss> But not many.
P. N. Anderson		The Chamber (John Grishham): Books: John Grisham,Michael Beck		2		This book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on "death row," at least in the state of Mississippi, and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences. <sssss> It touches on activities of the Ku Klux Klan. <sssss> It was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty. <sssss> However, some sympathy is found for the victims of crime. <sssss> The story centers on Sam Cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime. <sssss> Sam's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from "death row." <sssss> The latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution. <sssss> Meanwhile Sam shows repentance and response to the prison's chaplain. <sssss> I found it to be one of the better John Grisham books.
Poppiti		Tales from Shakespeare: Children's Classics: Books: Charles Lamb,Mary Lamb		2		I remember my father giving me this book when I was young. <sssss> He was a junior high school english teacher and used this book in class. <sssss> Together we read the stories and I loved them. <sssss> Now I am a college professor and use the book in class myself. <sssss> While some of the summaries are "dated," they are still useful in communicating the basic action of the play to students and the very fact that they are "dated" allows the book to serve as an illustration of how interpretations of Shakespeare's plays have changed since the Lambs' time. <sssss> I recommend this book heartily.
Paul N. Walton		The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature: Books: M. C. Howatson		2		A useful reference work for anyone interested in the literature of the ancient world, The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature is arranged alphabetically and contains encyclopedic entries for all of the major authors and their particular works, Greek and Latin gods, mythological characters, histories of Greece and Rome, major historical figures, and relevant places. <sssss> The original edition of the 1930s by Sir Paul Harvey became a classic of its own and was intended by the author to be a handbook of information for readers of the Greek and Latin authors and of modern works that touched upon the classical world. <sssss> The current second edition is edited by Margaret Howatson, who revises and enlarges the Harvey edition. <sssss> She notes that while a few of the entries on technical subjects were written with classical specialists in mind, the book generally requires no knowledge of Greek or Latin and is intended for anyone curious to find out more about the classical world. <sssss> An ideal companion for any reader interested in Greek or Latin literature and history
Aimee		Children With Starving Brains: A Medical Treatment Guide for Autism Spectrum Disorder, Second Edition: Books: Jaquelyn McCandless		1		My almost-6 year old daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and we took a multi-pronged approach, including things like supplements, a GFCF diet, and OT/PT/speech. <sssss> After a year on the GFCF diet and many specialized supplements and no change in behaviors, we went back to a normal diet with standard vitamin supplements and continued her behavioral therapies. <sssss> Our close friends' daughter, now age 4 and also diagnosed with autism, took a similar approach, but even more strict, following the DAN protocol as well as the recommendations of this book, including chelation, a dizzying array of supplements, GFCF diet, OT/PT/Speech, ABA, etc. <sssss> While our child has made tremenous advances, or friends' child has not, beyond minor advances related to her age--at 4, she is still non-verbal, far from potty trained, exhibits many repetitive behaviors, and needs constant verbal and visual cues for the simplest tasks. <sssss> The point I am trying to make is that every child is different and no one, NO ONE has shown that one course of therapy cures or even convincingly improves a significant percentage of children with autism. <sssss> Autism, as most of you likely know well, is a catch-all term. <sssss> Our friends' daughter no doubt has a very different kind of pathology than ours. <sssss> I have yet to really see a book or study address that fact first and foremost before offering a course of action, rather than immediately launching into predictions of one "cure" for a broad range of issues. <sssss> While I do think some of what the author recommends can be helpful (and it really may offer a tremendous help for some children with autism), some of the therapies (like chelation) can be very dangerous--in fact, I have yet to see one of the many families who tried chelation therapy see *any* improvement in their child's symptoms. <sssss> I have seen more success with GFCF diets (for a small percentage of children), but the greatest success seems to come with comprehensive behavioral therapy. <sssss> I certainly understand where families are coming from--I have been there myself, but treating your child like a guinea pig and attempting to "cure" them with multiple substances that have had very little study/peer review in a desperate frenzy of worry is both dangerous to their bodies and destructive to their emotions. <sssss> As with anything, balance is your approach will serve you and your child well.
Scott Burman "sburmann2"		The Good House: A Novel: Books: Tananarive Due		1		Not very scary, too long, and poor character development. <sssss> There are a lot of good reviews about the book. <sssss> Maybe I missed something
Minnesota Reader		Into a Paris Quartier: Books: Diane Johnson		1		I was drawn to this book by the promise of experiencing or gaining familiarity with a new part of Paris, a city I have visited often. <sssss> The book fell far short of that. <sssss> It left me disappointed and longing for what I had missed. <sssss> It was difficult to connect with or enter into the story primarily because the author failed to portray a personal intimacy with the subject. <sssss> As an example, she tells us that moving within Paris was a bigger event than imagined but the description lacked emotional depth. <sssss> Where were her feelings, little experiences, failings, successes, reactions. <sssss> Overall, the author proved she has knowledge but does not know how to share it.
Bergsteigerin		Angels Fall: Books: Nora Roberts,Joyce Bean		1		Hmm, quite a disappointment, especially after splurging on the hardcover edition. <sssss> Set as a kind of "Rockies Rear Window," this is one slow story. <sssss> Endless pages of crazy-making when I'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through. <sssss> Finally skipped ahead to finish the book. <sssss> I had really looked forward to Angels Fall, too :( If you are a Roberts fan, don't spend the money on the hardcover, wait for the paperback, go to the library, or borrow from a friend. <sssss> Not worth the price.
Andrew P. Kasch "winning financial strategies dot com"		Day Trade Online: Books: Christopher A. Farrell		1		The publishers should be sued. <sssss> Maybe we should get a class-action together. <sssss> Imagine taking an instruction manual for the very first Apple computer and putting a new title on it "How to use your new home computer" and selling it in bookstores today. <sssss> This book is doing EXACTLY that! <sssss> Also, it is highly doubtful that the tactic ever worked in the first place. <sssss> The author's website vanished years ago. <sssss> In a thinly traded NYSE stock if you try to repeatedly front the specialist with 2000 share orders he will simply move the price 50 cents against you immediately following your next purchase. <sssss> Game over. <sssss> [...
M.V.		Bloodlines: An Irene Kelly Novel (Irene Kelly Mysteries (Paperback)): Books: Jan Burke		2		This is a very involved book, bringing to light all the past and present characters. <sssss> I loved it. <sssss> It was nice to see the history of O'Connor and his mentor Jack. <sssss> I thought Ms. Burke pulled this one off nicely with the mystery being spread over a 40+ yr timeframe. <sssss> Nice job. <sssss> It was nice to see new characters introduced also, I hope to see them in future books. <sssss> If you haven't read this series, you could probably get away with starting out with this book. <sssss> I have to tell you though that you are missing a lot by not reading all of the other books in the Irene Kelly series.
G. Feng "gary"		Letter Perfect: The Marvelous History of Our Alphabet From A to Z: Books: David Sacks		1		You can tell I don't pay attention to Wall Street Journal or New York Times. <sssss> I picked up David Sacks' book from Borders' Linguistics stack because of the title. <sssss> I should have known better. <sssss> I started the first chapter and didn't have the time or intention to finish it. <sssss> The book is a collection of charts and stories about the history of alphabetic writing that are to be expected from the title -- in some cases conviniently summarized things in tables and maps -- but lacks, in my opinion, systematic thinking on the reasons behind the origin and prosperity of alphabetic writing that is found in other scholarly works (scholarly it is not). <sssss> Even within the first 20 pages or so, I was disawayed more than a few times by dubious claims, utter misinformation, and distastefully Euro/English-centric. <sssss> Here are some examples: "The alphabet was not the earliest writing: Egypt, Mesopotamia, and probably China already had nonalphabetic systems. <sssss> But the alphabet was the most efficient writing system ever found, before or since (p.1)" -- What about Hirogana for Japanese? <sssss> Syllabaries can be much more efficient for languages that do not have a large inventory of syllables. <sssss> "The 'spreadability' of an alphabet means that the future of our Roman letters looks very bright indeed. <sssss> (p. 10)" -- He was speaking of languages that are written in multiple alphabets, such as Swahili, Serbo-Croatian, Urdu/Hindi, and Yiddish. <sssss> And then came this proud comment on the prospect "our Roman letters". <sssss> Immediately following the above quote, he gave examples of Azerbaijian and Tatarstan's decision to switch to Roman, as well as other "struggling nation"'s likewise decisions to "switch to Roman letters for native tongues, as a big to tie into global trade and communications and to better prepare their prople to learn English. <sssss> Tragically, much that is venerable and spiritually sustaining while be lost. <sssss> Yet that seems inevitable in the 21st century were are shaping. <sssss> And it is sobering to reflect that our 26 letters wield such power." <sssss> His view of the learnability of the alphabet is also uneducated, shall I say. <sssss> The following superficial comment could have come from an old gradama who happened have NOT been a teacher for her lifetime. <sssss> "An alphabet enjoys on huge advantage over any other writing system: It needs fewer symbols. <sssss> No other sysmtem can get away with so few. <sssss> This makes an alphabet easier to learn. <sssss> Students need memorize only two dozen or so letters to begin building toward literacy, which typically takes about another five years of instruction". <sssss> And -- he writes -- because of this simplicity, children can become literate before the working age. <sssss> "This cricial fact has made the alphabet historically the vehicle of mass literacy. <sssss> (p.5)" Well, "vehicle" is a very clevery way of framing it. <sssss> At least he is not saying that where there is alphabet there is mass literacy. <sssss> Mass literacy was nevery a goal before the inducstry revolution. <sssss> Now Sacks joins the ranks of you-know-who's by implying that the Europeans and Western ideals were destined to take over the world because they had the alphabet and probably the mandate from God. <sssss> (Guns, what guns?) <sssss> Sacks also compared "our 26 letters" -- as if alphabetic writing is patented at the USPO -- to Chinese. <sssss> "Today Chinese schoolchildren normally take three years longer than Western children to learn to read and write, with most of that extra time devoted to mastering the symbols." <sssss> This is completely misinformation. <sssss> Learning to read Chinese is not easy, but do a little research, you will find studies over studies and books over books on comparitive studies of literacy (including my own). <sssss> I've nevery seen a credible study that substantiates the 3-year lag. <sssss> By the way, Sacks almost never gives citations. <sssss> I think that's enough. <sssss> This explains my total disappointment with the book -- I sholdn't have any high expectation from the start, had I known who David Sacks is.
N. Ramos "NP"		Color Atlas pppppppppp Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology: Common pppppppppp Serious Diseases (CD-ROM 2.0 for Windows pppppppppp Macintosh): Books: Thomas B. Fitzpatrick,Richard. A. Johnson,Klauss Wolff,Richard Suurmond		1		The package the book came in was smashed. <sssss> The book appeared as if it had been used. <sssss> It took over 2 weeks for it to arrive. <sssss> I wouldn't order any books from amazon agai
Jon Deepcreek		Tropic of Cancer: Books: Henry Miller		1		This book is filthy. <sssss> I had to take a shower after I read it. <sssss> Why doesn't he get a job? <sssss> Why does he have to live in France? <sssss> Why doesn't he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers? <sssss> So many questions. <sssss> People just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say James Michenier because it was banned. <sssss> It was banned because it's a bad book
Vivian Moongirl		Sappho's Leap: Books: Erica Jong		1		I have very mixed feelings about this book and can't say I enjoyed it all that much. <sssss> I love the story of Sappho, what little is known of it, and so I picked up this book expecting to see a historical fiction novel cut with realism, research, and certainly the unavoidable necessary lewdness of the celebrity of Lesbos. <sssss> But monsters? <sssss> Centaurs? <sssss> I mean, the story of Sappho's life is not the story of The Odyssey and for the life of me I don't understand why author Erica Jong decided to give her readers a combination of Greek heroine and Clash of the Titans. <sssss> Once I was able to get past the fantasy elements, I realized that I was not being pulled into the story on its own merits. <sssss> There wasn't enough emotional dimension -- for all her travels, we're shown pretty landscapes and scary oceans but we don't see enough of a real character. <sssss> I read Sappho's poems in college and the talented mind behind those words is NOT present in this book. <sssss> I'm not saying the book is without its good points. <sssss> Jong has certainly done a lot of research and her enthusiasm is many times contagious. <sssss> But I found the whole bit a little odd... like picking up a book about Cleopatra and seeing her encounter dragons, unicorns, and the goddess Isis. <sssss> If Jong had written about Ariadne, this all might have worked. <sssss> The blend of fantasy just didn't add up to a palatable meal for me
Arjun Bansal		Mating: Books: Norman Rush		2		I think one of my major problems was the level of opinion being shot at the reader in the book. <sssss> But then at times that made the book more entertaining - its acerbic opinion of the right, how Reagan getting elected made her feel stupid about being American, a funny British couple. <sssss> The description of small details from each of the characters' childhood was something I could relate to because i think of that myself. <sssss> There were clever tidbits from anthropology, and economics, and generally all fields of intellectual inquiry, all somehow connected with the patchwork of love and relationships, and thus brain meets heart and you end up with something almost like the Bible for our times. <sssss> The focus on the main character made it so that every detail about him was described. <sssss> Anyway, I am rambling, so, a note about the ending: I did find myself thinking this is getting very strange as the book got towards the ending. <sssss> It might have made more sense if Nelson actually was interested in the new girl the narrator finds for him, and the story then comes full circle. <sssss> It would end in a nice ironic sort of way. <sssss> However, his rejecting her makes in my mind for what would be a bad traditional ending. <sssss> I don't mind this, since the one time I wrote a story for a creative writing course I ended up with a terrible traditional ending. <sssss> Now, could he have been anything other than a mystic? <sssss> I felt that there was some hint towards Hinduism and spirituality building up towards the end. <sssss> He mentioned India and Hinduism unexpectedly and repeatedly at one point in the book. <sssss> So his becoming a mystic was alluding perhaps to the ashramas - and his transition from intellectual worker to a mystical worker to eventually a sage, as he attains Nirvana and becomes the Buddha of our times. <sssss> So in this way an ending emphasizing the spiritual, is perhaps the best. <sssss> In line with the book, the spiritual is the eternal, and only accessible through life-changing (near-death) experience. <sssss> What you do from 25-50 (making a model village in rural Africa) is transient (can never be perfect; infighting; hunting; guns; the "dark-side" of human nature will come back even in Utopia; i like the flexible hours; work when you want; accumulate credits; do manual labor once in a while; start the day with reading , not the end when you are tired; siesta, fiesta etc.) <sssss> no matter how good you are. <sssss> The girl herself is secondary to the book - ironic since the book promotes feminism, is written by a guy with a female narrator but a male protagonist, who she is fixated on and has doubts about. <sssss> But in the end the Jesus character is still male. <sssss> While the female goes back to Palo Alto and takes an average job in service of the savior. <sssss> The Man has the final laugh. <sssss> Do you favor a better ending
Rudi Diprima		How to Win Friends pppppppppp Influence People: Books: Dale Carnegie		2		This book is the most eye-opening, amazing, enlightening and practical work I have ever read. <sssss> There were so many jewels of wisdom and edifying anecdotes in these pages. <sssss> Anyone who is serious about improving their relations with others on the job and socially should read this work with the utmost attention. <sssss> If everyone practiced these simple principles, this society would be truly utopian. <sssss> That is why I bought 12 of them: to be able to give it to friends and associates who I believe would really benefit from it
Andrew Salmon		The Gutter And the Grave (Hard Case Crime): Books: Ed McBain		2		The late Ed McBain left all mystery buffs a lasting legacy with his 87th Precinct novels but a worthy addition to this legacy is The Gutter And The Grave. <sssss> Written in 1958, this hardboiled gem has been all but forgotten. <sssss> But thanks to Hard Case Crime, a new generation can experience this incredible early work from one of the all-time masters. <sssss> The hero, Cordell, is as tragic and harboiled as they come as he, soaked in cheap booze, wallows in the memory of an unfaithful wife. <sssss> Until a favor for a friend draws him into a web of murder and deception. <sssss> It seems everyone is lying and each lie twists the tail in new directions, leaving the reader's head spinning. <sssss> The novel features McBain's usually excellent dialogue, the setting is well-drawn featuring the jazz scene in 1950's New York. <sssss> There's humor, pathos, some great fights and enough broken dreams to fill Broadway. <sssss> This little gem of a novel has been unavailable for far too long. <sssss> I give it my highest recommendation. <sssss> Fantastic!
Odinsblade "odinsblade"		The Revolution Betrayed: Books: Leon Trotsky,Max Eastman		1		You know, I hate to burst the bubble of devoted Trotskyites across the globe, but Trotsky was just as responsible for Stalin's rule as anyone. <sssss> For Leon to blame Stalin is the height of hypocrisy. <sssss> Without Lenin's apparatus of social repression and Trotsky's apparatus of military dictatorship, Stalin would never have been. <sssss> The Russian Revolution was never a win for workers. <sssss> It destroyed them, some 4 million at Lenin's hands, 30 million by Stalin, and 65 million by Mao Tse-tung. <sssss> No policy or ideology that denies the soul can ever succeed. <sssss> And communism does just that. <sssss> By denying that which makes humans humans, it can bring only suffering
M. Connelly "bookie"		And Nobody Got Hurt!: The World's Weirdest, Wackiest True Sports Stories: Books: Len Berman,Kent Gamble		2		Usually it's a struggle to get my 10 year old son to read. <sssss> He could not put this book down and has spent the last few days reading it aloud to me and citing different stories. <sssss> Now he wants me to look for similar books. <sssss> A success!
D. Cloyce Smith "rabid bookfiend"		If on a winter's night a traveler: Books: Italo Calvino		2		You, the reader, are the subject and the hero of Calvino's novel, an exercise in reader-response theory gone mad. <sssss> Calvino's lively experiment begins by describing a reader (that is, "you") reading Calvino's novel and, after this opening, "you" settle in to read the novel that you were "meant" to be reading--a noir mystery with a cliffhanger at the end of the first chapter. <sssss> But all is not fair in the Land of Fiction; the copy of the book has been misbound by the printer, so you have to rush to the store to get a properly printed book--only to find that the replacement is a different book entirely. <sssss> After several tricks and machinations, you end up reading the beginnings of ten different books, written in ten different styles, yet all sharing place and character names and even themes. <sssss> (Part of the fun is identifying the author being imitated: the most obvious segments mock Borges, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov.) <sssss> While initially it seems that Calvino assumes you are male, soon you are introduced to the Other Reader and "you" see the story through her eyes. <sssss> Both of you work to solve the mystery of the erratic book passages, and the pleasure of reading is heightened by romantic tensions between the two of you. <sssss> The book alternates between the story fragments and the story of "you." <sssss> The repeated changes and interruptions in style and story can be baffling: "You can't get your bearings: the characters have changed, the settings, you don't understand what it's about, you find names of people and don't know who they are." <sssss> It's a bit like "Groundhog Day," except that instead of being stuck inside the same day, you're doomed to repeat ten different but terrifyingly similar acts of literature interruptus. <sssss> Well before the end of the novel, you realize that the real story is not to be found in any of the parodies (mysteries, fantasies, and romances) that you desperately try (and fail) to finish, but in the story of your reading experience itself--an experience made all the more complicated by the web of conspiracies engendered by the Other Reader, a reclusive popular writer, a charlatan churning out counterfeit books under the writer's name, a sloppy and conniving translator, and various officials of repressive dictatorships. <sssss> For the reader who doesn't mind when an author attempts to describe your state of mind, Calvino's novel can be pure fun. <sssss> The success of Calvino's task depends in no small part on whether the reading experience he describes recalls how you read a book; I know that some readers find some of these passages alien ("That's not how I read books"), but for me the various descriptions of the reading experience were both perceptive and eerily familiar. <sssss> This reader, too, found the first half of the book far more engaging than the second half; later in the book, the gimmick inevitably wears a little thin and the detours that spoof publishing conglomerates, repressive governments, and state censorship were a bit more than this short novel could handle. <sssss> And the "solution" to the puzzle, although fitting, has the oomph of the finale to a shaggy-dog story. <sssss> No matter--if you enjoy metafiction, you might just recognize yourself in this clever book
Johnny B. Good		City of Bones: Books: Michael Connelly,Peter J. Fernandez		2		A very good crime fiction book. <sssss> Connelly fans should buy this book without any hesitation if you don't have it already. <sssss> Why it's good? <sssss> 1) Connelly is very good at creating 3 dimensional, believable, realistic characters and this book is no different. <sssss> 2) A very realistic behind the scene look in the inner workings of a police department, he's supposed to have been a crime beat writer. <sssss> 3) Logical plot. <sssss> His books are not as fast flowing or edge of the seat exciting or scary as some thrillers, but they can't be if they are crime fiction. <sssss> Rather, he takes you through the investigation step by step, going through the process that his detectives go through so you can see how they solve the crime. <sssss> Cons: The only con I have is that the books are somewhat noir (I'm plagarizing this word from some other review). <sssss> The thing is, Bosch is not your spiffy "yes sir", toe the blue line cop. <sssss> And so, even though you want Bosch not to stir the pot and just get on with his detecting he does his best to sabotage his position in the force and your wishes, well, c'est la vie, apparently Connelly likes to put angst in his readers' lives. <sssss> I'm not going to spoil the book, if you must know what the book is about you can read the intro. <sssss> All I'm trying to get across is why this book is good. <sssss> A must buy
Reader "Reader"		The Client: Books: John Grisham		1		I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. <sssss> Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. <sssss> The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. <sssss> The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out
wbjonesjr1		Purple Hibiscus: Books: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie		1		I bought this book because (if I recall correctly) it was long-listed for last years ManBooker Prize and also, (this I recall) because it had good reviews here on Amazon. <sssss> Anyway, I was real disappointed. <sssss> I quit paying attention after page 100 and quit outright a few pages later. <sssss> I found the contrasting aspects of the Father's character interesting but after awhile so contrasting they felt way off reality. <sssss> Character of aunt, cousin, priest, mom etc etc also grew gratingly "perfect." <sssss> This may be excessive, but after a while I felt like I was reading a bit of sophisticated version of a teen romance novel. <sssss> The comparisons with God of Small Things are seriously unflattering to Roy's great book. <sssss> Comparisons with (the overrated) Memoirs of a Geisha or (also not finished) One Thousand Chestnut Trees would have been more appropriate
TB "Mommy to 3 great kids"		My Girl: Adventures with a Teen in Training: Books: Karen Stabiner		1		I thought this book was a waste of my reading time. <sssss> I saw a review on the Today Show, and read several postive reviews as well, and it piqued my interest. <sssss> What I thought may be a book about how to deal with and accept the coming changes/challenges of a mother/pre-teen daughter relationship was a book about a mother seeming to tiptoe around her daughter's emotional state. <sssss> What is Sarah going to think about this, what is she going to say about that, etc.? <sssss> The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that I applaud the time spent Karen and Sarah spent together. <sssss> Something that should be done in all parent-child relationships. <sssss> I would like to think there are better books on this subject.
M. Griffin "viviankosiba"		The Nautical Chart: Books: Arturo Perez-Reverte,Margaret Sayers Peden		1		The Nautical Chart could have been a better book if, its author had eliminated about 50 to 100 pages. <sssss> The story dragged. <sssss> I read it at night in bed and I kept falling asleep. <sssss> The book does have its merits. <sssss> The information regarding navigational instruments and history was interesting and was exciting at times. <sssss> The ending was good (the best part of the book). <sssss> The relationship between the Coy and Tanger had shades of James Caine and Jim Thompson. <sssss> Even so, I would hestitate about recommending this novel.
Tonesha Borner		The Kitchen God's Wife: Books: Amy Tan		2		When you read any of Amy Tan's books it makes you feel like you are a part of the story. <sssss> This book was a great read because it evokes emotions of excitement and sadness for the main character all at once
R. B. Weeks		Owning Your Own Shadow: Understanding the Dark Side of the Psyche: Books: Robert A. Johnson		2		This was the first book by Johnson I read, though my mentors and teachers spoke of him often. <sssss> The information about the mandorla was particularly helpful, giving a visual and archetypical model for holding the energy of the apparently opposite forces in a space of new possibility. <sssss> Johnson writes that if I can be with the opposites, at the point of their intersection and stay with my conflicting thoughts and impulses long enough, the two will teach each other something and produce an insight that serves both... produce something utterly new instead of win, lose or compromise. <sssss> The key appears to be that every real solution has to grow from the unique situation I face. <sssss> Formulas, how-to's, devices and processes can never be enough in such moments. <sssss> Referring to my own past for an experiential reference or to another's experience or advice can't do it, either, because it prevents or sidetracks the point of unlimited potential that wants to appear in and emerge out of each unique encounter. <sssss> I liked what Maria had to say in her post: "Meet your shadow", dated November 22, 2003. <sssss> She said she gave it only 4 stars because he doesn't tell how to DO that is described as possible in the book... <sssss> I felt a little of that, too. <sssss> And I have since appreciated the blessing of not being told how until I've done a bit of my own struggle with my own opposites in many life situations. <sssss> A book I found to be a perfect companion to this one is "I of the Storm - Embracing Conflict, Creating Peace", by Gary Simmons. <sssss> I highly recommend it in addition to this book. <sssss> It addresses some of the questions I felt about the nature of conflict after finishing Owning Your Own Shadow, in a way that shed light into my life. <sssss> I am very appreciative of both books.
E. Deerin		In the Fall: A Novel: Books: Jeffrey Lent		1		It's not that the actual story is nonsense but they guy has included so much 'fluff' that you get board waiting on a paragraph with real content. <sssss> This book was so frustrating, I really wish I had saved myself the bother of reading it
N. Williams		Final Fantasy XII Signature Series Guide: Books: BradyGames		1		You'd be better off using the internet to figure the game out. <sssss> The guide feels super cluttered, it's almost hard to read and it doesn't tell you everything at the right time. <sssss> I think it feels cluttered because there's too many pictures in it. <sssss> Every page has at least 7 or 8 images on it. <sssss> The best thing about the guide is the production value but I didn't buy for that
G. Cherr		Running and Breathing: Books: Justin O'Brien		1		The book is interesting, and well written. <sssss> It contains little unique or scarcely known or understood information. <sssss> Novice runners might like it and get more from it than experienced runners.
Adam Craig		The Waste Land (Dark Tower (Library)): Books: Stephen King		2		The Waste Lands, the third novel in Stephen King's The Dark Tower series is by far the best volume yet. <sssss> This volume picks up a short time after the end of Drawing of the Three, and we see Roland training Eddie and Susannah to become true gunslingers in Roland's world. <sssss> Soon into the novel, the three gunslingers encounter one the Guardians of Mid-World, a huge cyborg bear, who is guarding a portal that goes between the different worlds. <sssss> Roland explains that each of these portals is connected to the Dark Tower by a beam, and if they follow the beam, it will lead them directly to the Dark Tower, they just don't know how far away it is. <sssss> As the three gunslingers start to follow the beam, we, the readers, are taken to our own world and reintroduced to Jake, the ill-fated child from The Gunslinger. <sssss> Jake is currently having a mental breakdown (as is Roland) due to the fact that Roland saved him from dying his destined death at the hands of a Cadillac in The Drawing of the Three. <sssss> One part of Jake tells him he should be dead, the other says he should be alive. <sssss> Jake's mental breakdown leads him on a journey across New York to a haunted house that has many connections with other characters in the book, and in this house, Jake believes he can get back to Mid-World and be reunited with Roland. <sssss> The final part of the journey in The Waste Lands, takes our group to a city called Lud, on the outskirts of the waste lands. <sssss> The group believes they need to find a monorail named Blaine in the city, and he will help them on their journey to the Dark Tower. <sssss> Once they enter the city, much goes wrong and we are introduced to a really cool, but really evil character called the Tick-Tock Man, who runs Lud. <sssss> All of this leads up to a ridiculously exciting conclusion and a killer cliffhanger that makes me really glad I waited to read these until they were all published. <sssss> As far as action and suspense goes, The Waste Lands takes the cake easily from the previous two books. <sssss> Most of all, this book makes us appreciate the character development from the previous books. <sssss> We care so much about these characters, and would be devastated if anything were to happen to them. <sssss> This book also goes a long way in providing some much needed answers about the Dark Tower in general and Mid-World. <sssss> These answers are both satisfying and frustrating. <sssss> They are satisfying that you aren't completely clueless as to what is going on, but there are deeper answers to everything that we are given in this novel, so it just makes you want to read on more. <sssss> The series just keeps getting better as it goes along
favouritedress		The Noonday Demon: An Atlas Of Depression: Books: Andrew Solomon		1		All I could think was, "Damn, if I had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge, I'd never be depressed." <sssss> I don't know quite how to explain it, but I felt no empathy for him. <sssss> I only ended up feeling more depressed. <sssss> As a history of depression, the level of research was quite impressive. <sssss> If you read Prozac Nation and wanted to punch her out, steer clear of this one as well
S. Vanderhyde		The Complete Book of Food Counts: Books: Corinne T. Netzer		1		While this book contains a ton of data, don't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade. <sssss> If you look up french toast, for example, it only gives information on name brand items. <sssss> Much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products. <sssss> I suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping, or use it before eating out, it would be helpful. <sssss> But if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items, you are out of luck with this book
M. Bunenko		Hot Zone: Books: Richard Preston		1		Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf." <sssss> When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. <sssss> What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption. <sssss> The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. <sssss> We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. <sssss> From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. <sssss> Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story. <sssss> The big story is, alas, not so impressive. <sssss> It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. <sssss> Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. <sssss> In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type. <sssss> The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. <sssss> He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. <sssss> Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. <sssss> And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. <sssss> When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? <sssss> Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? <sssss> Does anyone really care? <sssss> I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. <sssss> Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects. <sssss> And what a bore that became. <sssss> There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write. <sssss> If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. <sssss> If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. <sssss> Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting
Johnny B. Good		Prince of Fire: Books: Daniel Silva		1		Someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! <sssss> Hmm, I wonder who that could be. <sssss> I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like one of the books, reasonably, I thought. <sssss> Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. <sssss> I used no profanities. <sssss> OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. <sssss> Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. <sssss> Maybe whoever it was just didn't like my negative review. <sssss> Well, the last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country. <sssss> OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time. <sssss> I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. <sssss> I struggled through 1/3 of the book but the author could not capture my attention and I decided not to continue to the end. <sssss> I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. <sssss> I will not be buying any more of his books
Naomi Johnson "beauvallet"		The Last Temptation (A Dr. Tony Hill pppppppppp Carol Jordan Mystery): Books: Val McDermid		1		This is my 3rd McDermid novel, I previously read 'Mermaids Singing' and 'Wire in the Blood.' <sssss> McDermid writes good prose but in this 3rd novel I see dangerous repetitions in character types which, if repeated in the next Tony Hill/Carol Jordan book will make that one my last purchase. <sssss> Generally McDermid paints female police officers as brighter, more diligent and more intuitive than their male counterparts, as well as more often homosexual. <sssss> The men, with the exception of leading man Tony Hill, are mostly all egotistical, back-stabbing, power-hungry morons of the lowest order, while Hill is rendered impotent -- a redundant bit of emasculation since all the other males are castrated of their moral fiber. <sssss> The slow mating dance between Hill and Jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff. <sssss> And in this book, the serial killer and the surrounding hunt for him are as limply portrayed as Dr. Hill. <sssss> The emotional connection between Hill and the killers in the two previous books is missing here, making the entire killer plot read like an afterthought. <sssss> And the real villain -- not the serial killer but a drug-pushing / illegal-immigrant smuggler loses character focus as the reader is given reason to sympathize with him as well as with the killer. <sssss> The climactic scenes involving the capture of one villain and the death of another are without any sense of thrill or danger. <sssss> I was extremely disappointed with this book
John Hruschka		The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism Updated Edition: Books: Russell D. Roberts		1		Roberts' little fable pits a wholly benign free-trade against absolute protectionism and guess which one looks better. <sssss> Based on the theories of David Ricardo, the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible. <sssss> In The Choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt CEOs. <sssss> Fables like The Choice (or the "free-market economy" for that matter) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple. <sssss> That's why the book is dangerous. <sssss> The Choice has almost nothing to do with the real world, but it sounds good. <sssss> The argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable. <sssss> If you buy Roberts' version of Ricardo, however, you must accept Wal-Mart as the epitome of business virtue. <sssss> Roberts may be a great guy, and he certainly writes well. <sssss> Unfortunately, his book begins with a series of fallacious premises and works its way toward a conclusion that is simple, elegant, and horribly wrong
TawnTawn		What The Corpse Revealed: Books: Hugh Miller		1		While reading this book I found the details of some cases to be unbelievable. <sssss> Also, the "photographs" of the murderers and detectives all looked fuzzy and more like drawings. <sssss> I've read a lot of true crime and never heard of catching a murderer because he breathed his asthma medication on the murder victim's hair. <sssss> Or because they chemically deduced which cologne he wore. <sssss> And who leaves their backdoor open when they know a violent Doberman Pinscher has been getting through their backyard fence? <sssss> Sure, just let that dog on in. <sssss> And whose place of employment has a record of all employee's blood "groups" (not their TYPES, just their GROUPS), when the employee doesn't even know HIMSELF what group he is? <sssss> Then I read the introduction, which I always skip, and found out this book is FICTION, not true crime as the cover announced and in which section it was in in the book store. <sssss> As FICTION, it's okay, (I prefer Agatha Christie), but I don't believe the forensic work in this book is even based on any fact. <sssss> So read it for entertainment, but don't be so gullible as to believe any of it
Patrick Shepherd "hyperpat"		Citizen of the Galaxy: Books: Robert Heinlein		2		Citizen explores just what freedom really is as it follows a young man, Thorby, as he matures from boy to man. <sssss> Starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar, Baslim, we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom, though we see that in fact 'slaves' sometimes have more freedom of choice than 'free men'. <sssss> The society he paints here is vivid and believable (though the economics of slavery in a star-travelling culture has always seemed a little dubious to me). <sssss> Baslim is far more than he appears to be, and puts Thorby through a rigorous education, both academic and practical. <sssss> How do you become a really good beggar? <sssss> Here Heinlein falls in with Ayn Rand - whatever you do, do it to the best of your ability, from begging to juggling. <sssss> Also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self - lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums. <sssss> These are items that may pass over young readers' heads, but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined, nothing should be accepted on 'faith', that personal integrity is more important than 'success', that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action. <sssss> Later, Baslim calls in some favors and sends Thorby to live with the Free Traders, a group of space merchants that keep to themselves with their own unique culture. <sssss> Here Thorby discovers another aspect of freedom: a person's ability to do as he wishes is severely constrained by the culture in which he lives. <sssss> The Free Trader society (which owes much to Margaret Mead's seminal ideas, and highlighted by an anthropologist character named Margaret Mader - Heinlein was not usually so obvious with his names) of rigid matriarchal domination and separation into moieties provides security, peace of mind, and the ability through rigid rules of formalism to allow a small group of people to live together for extended periods without breaking any heads, but has as its downside great limitations on freedom of choice. <sssss> This section of the book may be the best part, as the society is so different from today's American culture that it becomes fascinating in its own right, apart from its effects on Thorby. <sssss> Thorby himself grows and changes significantly in this part of the book, from first love to determining just how he must balance the demands of duty and personal desires. <sssss> The last section deals with Thorby back on Earth, within a society not much different from our own, and shows a third aspect of freedom: the internal courageousness to make your own decisions and act upon them. <sssss> Freedom is just as constrained by internal timidity and/or defining decisions as by external forces. <sssss> As this last section offers little in terms of new or different views of society (though it is a good mirror of some of the flaws of a capitalistic/lawyer dominated one), it isn't as engrossing as the first two sections, but is highly important in terms of completing Heinlein's thematic investigation of all aspects of freedom. <sssss> Characterization other than Thorby and Baslim is pretty thin, especially for the females that appear in supporting roles. <sssss> This was fairly typical for his juveniles, as they were basically strong adventure novels with their primary focus on their central character. <sssss> But the thematic line on slavery/freedom is much stronger here than most of his messages in other books, and as this particular position is also stated in some of those other works (most especially Farnham's Freehold), has to be seen as one of Heinlein's personal beliefs (unlike some other positions he proposes in his books that seem mainly designed to stir up debate). <sssss> This book is not Heinlein's absolute best, nor even the best of his so-called 'juveniles' (which are typically better reading than most 'adult' mainstream bestsellers), but still provides an engrossing, fun, and illuminating read. <sssss> Recommended for all readers willing to look at life styles different from their own. <sssss> --- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)
Karuna Kahuna		The Book on Karuna Reiki: Advanced Healing Energy for Our Evolving World: Books: Laurelle Shanti Gaia,William Lee Rand		2		This book was referred to me by one of the author's students. <sssss> I have been practicing Karuna Reiki for several years. <sssss> I was thrilled to read this book. <sssss> The author has introduced many specific healing techniques and symbol combinations that have produced amazing results for my clients. <sssss> She obviously has an incredible passion for Karuna Reiki because the book reads as if the energy itself wrote every word.
Anton B. kuzmanov		The Temple and the Lodge: Books: Michael Baigent,Richard Leigh		1		This is another offshoot of the commercially successful predecessor. <sssss> The book traces the history of the knights templar and their supposed transformation into free masons. <sssss> Much of the discussion focuses on free masonry, including its role in the American Revolution. <sssss> I found the factual support lacking and the prose quite uninspired
R. Kelley "Sound Seeker"		Buried Fire: Books: Jonathan Stroud		1		I picked this book up after reading both Books in the Bartimeus Trilogy and was excited to see what else Jonathan Stroud could conjure up. <sssss> This book was a let down. <sssss> I just couldn't get into the plot. <sssss> I even found the story somewhat disturbing and eerie, especially for young children to read. <sssss> There are very evil characters in this book who would be much better suited for an adult sci-fi novel, rather than a book marketed for children and young teens. <sssss> The characters were unlikeable, and the plot just never seemed to grab my attention. <sssss> I was very dissapointed that this is from the same author who wrote the amazing Bartimeus trilogy books! <sssss> Well, I figured I would add my two cents in and let people know I just didn't like this book
Jennifer Goldman "pond46jg"		Lifeguard: Books: James Patterson,Andrew Gross		2		I listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away, it is a find! <sssss> Nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places, like news readers. <sssss> I loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book. <sssss> I also liked that the story was partly done in first person. <sssss> The main character initially doesn't seem to have much to offer the world..... <sssss> Anyway, there are others who have diagramed the story, I just wanted to say, I enjoyed it and the way it was presented in audio version.
K. Wessell "Avid Business Book Reader"		CustomerCentric Selling: Books: Michael Bosworth,John Holland		1		I'm surprised that someone so seemingly intelligent does not know that stories and specific examples are what make a book interesting. <sssss> This book was totally devoid of them, but instead used vague generalizations from beginning to end. <sssss> I read the whole book and was waiting for it to get good. <sssss> It never did. <sssss> Don't waste your time or your money. <sssss> Any positive review must have been written by the author's friends. <sssss> I would rather eat cardboard that read this book again.
Morrighan		The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy: Books: Byron York		2		Devoted entirely to coming to Amazon to trash conservative books? <sssss> I see the same names here I saw for Kate O'Bierne's book, Tony Blankley's book, Michelle Malkin's books, David Limbaugh's books...you get the idea. <sssss> And most of your reviews say almost the exact same thing, too. <sssss> You'd think SOME of you would aim for creativity, especially when you're accusing Republicans of being mindless automatons. <sssss> That said, York's research is impeccable, and anyone who paid attention to the last Presidential election knows EXACTLY how hard George Soros, Hollywood, et al. <sssss> worked to push Kerry through, from Cameron Diaz's teary "If you want rape to be legal, don't vote" lunacy on Oprah to the dollars moveon.org spent demonizing the Swiftboat vets. <sssss> No one works harder than the Left to silence dissenting opinion and hide the truth. <sssss> It's because of books like this one, conservative talk radio, and Fox News that conservatives finally have a voice in this country, and the left hasn't had to debate for so long, they've forgotten how. <sssss> To anyone looking for truthful, incisive commentary on how far the Left has gone to demonize and destroy Bush, how much time, money, and effort they've wasted to obstruct him at every turn, regardless of whether the policy in question would benefit the country, this is an excellent book. <sssss> If you're a mind-numbed leftist automaton that opposes everything purely on unquestioning ideological grounds--well, I guess I'll be seeing your reviews on the next conservative bestseller, won't I
David Brown		At Twelve: Portraits of Young Women: Books: Sally Mann,Ann Beattie		1		just awful save your money, this book is not worth it. <sssss> The pictures are dull and lifeless, boring composition. <sssss> Mann hasn't captured anything here but a bunch of worthless photos. <sssss> Any 10th rate amateur photographer could have done better.
The Painless		The Extraordinary Journeys: Journey to the Centre of the Earth (Oxford World's Classics : the Extraordinary Journeys): Books: Jules Verne,William Butcher		2		Exciting and highly entertaining story about 3 men who travel to the centre of the earth through an extinct volcano. <sssss> Here they come across prehistoric forests, a giant subterranean sea inhabited by prehistoric marine dinosaurs, and some ancient offshoots of man. <sssss> Although some of the science bits are outdated, implausable and sometimes drag a little, the book is still surprisingly modern and fresh after 140 years. <sssss> Maybe the first adventure novel of this kind and certainly of influence on modern culture.
E. Williams		The RealAge Makeover: Take Years off Your Looks and Add Them to Your Life: Books: Michael F. Roizen		2		I love this book in conjunction with Dr. Perricone's books. <sssss> They compliment each other nicely. <sssss> A great tweak to feeling and looking better
E. Moeser "Dr. Britta A.Moeser"		Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics: Books: Joseph S. Nye		1		Joseph Nye keeps repeating himself: multilateralism by global American charm attack. <sssss> That is simply a stupid assumption. <sssss> And it is untrue of American history in foreign relations. <sssss> Nye still owes some answers to European scholars of International Relations who criticized his idea. <sssss> In fact that is no personal multilateral approach..
JME		False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear: Books: Marc MD Siegel		2		With all the sensationalism and relentless obfuscation of the realities of life by the media I found this an exhillarating and thought provoking book. <sssss> There's more..., but I'm sure you'll read and revisit this book again and again once it's prominently displayed on your bookshelf. <sssss> Worth every penny...
Browneyed Reader		A Time to Kill: Books: John Grisham		2		A Time to Kill and The Broker are my two favs from Grisham. <sssss> Suspense is the name of the game. <sssss> I like books that make me read them straight through because they're so suspense filled. <sssss> Another great novel is Deadly Behavior by Dee Sullivan.
Shannon M. Udland "Alaska girl"		Flip the Switch: Lose the Excuses, Lose the Weight, and Get the Body You've Always Wanted: Books: Jim Karas		2		Flip the Switch is an excellent book. <sssss> I'm 29 and tired of being overweight. <sssss> I bought this book months ago. <sssss> I read half of it, then moved from Seattle to Valdez, Alaska. <sssss> All the while I was moving, I could not stop thinking about this book. <sssss> As soon as my shipment arrived, I found the book ASAP and finished it. <sssss> I have seen that some complain about the resistance products he promotes in his books. <sssss> I look at it this way: Spend a ton of money on a gym membership or spend around $10.00 for a resistance rope - PLUS - you get to do this in the privacy of your home. <sssss> This is a great idea, especially for women that have children, a job and the home to contend with. <sssss> Jim Karas was overweight for several years. <sssss> He can relate to me. <sssss> He revels on the fact that resistance training is the way to go and thank goodness because I simply cannot handle cardio workouts due to a bad back. <sssss> The running and "stepping" in cardio is too much for me. <sssss> This is a great book for anyone but women will especially appreciate the convenience
john fontana		Blue Screen (Sunny Randall Novels): Books: Robert B. Parker,Kate Burton		1		I bought this book because of the 4 star rating by readers. <sssss> Let me be candid....what the hell were they reading? <sssss> This book is simply insipid, implausible and a waste of time. <sssss> Get this for a premise....rich, geeky guy buys a major league baseball team called the "Connecticut Nutmegs"! <sssss> Nutmegs for a major league team??!! <sssss> Yeah, right. <sssss> It gets better....he has an incredibly sexy girl friend who stars in the C-list movies he produces....ok hold on to your seats, here comes the good part....she is going to be his star player on this MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL team!! <sssss> Why, because in college she was an excellent athlete. <sssss> So some buxom starlet who ran track in college is going to play major league baseball!! <sssss> Am I the only one who thinks this is plain stupid. <sssss> Oh, yeah there's a murder along the way. <sssss> Parker (author) must have pictures of the publisher having sex with a goat otherwise I can't think of a reason why it got published.
		The Demon Soul (Warcraft: War of the Ancients, Book 2): Books: Richard A. Knaak		2		The story of Illidan, Malfurion, Rhonin, and krasus using dark powers, heroic strength is enough to blow anyone away. <sssss> Iy enchants me, it shows the World of Warcraft from a combination of Knaak's and Blizzard Entertainment's imagination
S. Allen		Object of Affection: Books: Stephen McCauley		1		I saw this book at a friend's shortly after seeing the movie. <sssss> I asked her if I could borrow it. <sssss> She said I wouldn't want to. <sssss> She'd been trying to read it for awhile, and didn't like it. <sssss> I decided to try anyway. <sssss> Unfortunately, my friend was right. <sssss> This is a definite case of a movie being much better than a book. <sssss> I really liked the movie. <sssss> However, the book is too long and boring. <sssss> There are so many tangents in it that have nothing to do with the central story. <sssss> I can't believe I even finished it. <sssss> Rent the movie-don't waste your time on the book
Bragan Thomas		Johannes Vermeer: Books: Arthur K. Wheelock,Ben Broos		2		I was fortunate enough to have seen the now-legendary Vermeer exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. during the winter of 1995-96. <sssss> 21 out of the 35 (or 36) extant paintings by Vermeer were included in the show, offering a unique opportunity to see the bulk of Vermeer's amazing works in a single space, something that no one has experienced since 1696, when @20 of his paintings were auctioned in Delft. <sssss> Given the rarity and fragility of Vermeer's works, it is unlikely that such an event will ever be repeated. <sssss> All who were unable to make it to the show, however, have this splendid book as a document of this unique event. <sssss> This book will remain the standard work on Vermeer for many decades, and represents the fruit of several years' labor by art historians on two continents. <sssss> Because so little is in fact known about Vermeer the man (in truth, we have no idea at all what Vermeer's education, interests, and personality were like), the catalogue essays fill this gap by contextualizing Vermeer's work within the history of Dutch painting, the development of perspective, and the fascinating tale of Vermeer's pppppppppp quot;rediscovery pppppppppp quot; in the 19th century and his richly-deserved rise to worldwide fame. <sssss> The essays and catalogue entries may be too technical for some readers, as the authors have expended a lot of effort to reconstruct Vermeer's exact technique, something which can only be gleaned from careful study of the paintings themselves (no drawings by Vermeer have survived, nor have any statements he may have made about painting). <sssss> This extensive scholarly apparatus, while illuminating and occasionally even riveting (the essay dealing with Vermeer's rediscovery is a great detective narrative! <sssss> ), tends to obscure the strange, even uncanny emotional charge that his images are suffused with. <sssss> Vermeer's personal world - so limited in content yet unforgettably haunting and evocative - is one of stillness and peace suffused with tension. <sssss> Each image contains remarkable spatial and temporal ambiguities that make simple scenes like a lady writing a letter while her maid looks away or two people standing near a piano (The Music Lesson) vibrate with dramatic tension. <sssss> Sadly, the somewhat passionless writing encases the pictures (all of which are superbly reproduced) in a rhetoric that does not address the fundamental issue: What is it about these paintings that is so powerful that their maker was rescued from total obscurity and has inspired poetry, novels and countless studies? <sssss> I was hoping to find some discussion of the psychological meaning of these images, but the traditional (overly scholarly and dry) art history within did nothing to help me understand my passion for the pppppppppp quot;Sphinx of Delft. <sssss> pppppppppp quot; That said, the book is a masterpiece of empirical research on the artist (barring some new discovery, it is unlikely that we will ever have any more facts about Vermeer and his world than can be read here), exquisitely designed, and distinguished with beautiful reproductions. <sssss> The volume is certainly one of the few bestsellers in the field of the art book - when I attended the show, the paperback print of the book was totally sold out and the hardcover was flying off the shelves (it is odd that the book has not been reprinted in paperback). <sssss> Johannes Vermeer is THE text to have on this artist and is unlikely to be superseded anytime soon. <sssss> Immerse yourself in Vermeer's world and you will be transformed. <sssss> Seeing this exhibition changed my life, and I treasure this book as a means of recapturing the awe and joy that overwhelmed me at the time. <sssss> I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I have
S. Ryan		Naughty Stories from A to Z: Books: Alison Tyler		1		I appreciate that there has to be some of this to cater to the various tastes out there--but this book has way too much. <sssss> I read 4 stories in a row that were either about lesbians or bisexual men. <sssss> I am going to stick to books that have more balance or emphasize hot sex between men and women. <sssss> The other stuff just doesn't do it for me. <sssss> I got bored and started turning the pages fast. <sssss> Disappointing
Tonya Russo "Horder of books"		A New Song (Mitford): Books: Jan Karon		2		Another great book as usual! <sssss> Too bad there aren't more books like her's. <sssss> Don't we all wish we lived in Mitford! <sssss> Great Bible quotes, great friendships and a little love splashed in somewhere
Kimberly A. Grassey "Kimba2121"		Philosophy: The Power of Ideas with PowerWeb: Philosophy: Books: Brooke Noel Moore,Ken Bruder		1		I am a bright student and have a GPA of 3.86. <sssss> This book is completely useless for class. <sssss> I reread the chapters and it simply does not make sense. <sssss> I found the internet to contain more useful information. <sssss> This book should not be used in any Introduction to Philosophy classes. <sssss> It is much too complex. <sssss> If you are attending classes at WIU, I would skip the purchase of this book and rely on the internet for your assignments
Hobbyist2006 "A Hobbyist"		Starting photography: Books: Michael John Langford		2		If you are just starting out on photography, I highly recommend this book. <sssss> It begins immediately on the first chapter on picture making! <sssss> For this reason alone, I would give it 5 stars. <sssss> Here in the first chapter, the authors wasted no time to tell you what makes good pictures: the photographer, not the equipment. <sssss> They then proceed to explain why the majority of our pictures (at least, the rest of us non-professionals) turn out unflattering despite our best efforts and high-tech cameras. <sssss> If you read nothing else but the first chapter alone, I would bet that your photography will already begin to improve. <sssss> Or if not, the first chapter will at least inspire you to try the suggestions and see the result yourself. <sssss> In fact, even if all you have is a humble point and shoot film camera, the things they teach in the first chapter are still totally valid, as the principles of good photography remains the same whether you use film or digital. <sssss> The next chapters give details about camera operations, how to creatively use camera controls, and another great topic, how to tackle different photographic subjects. <sssss> Just what I needed! <sssss> I like the chapter on how to process you own film in black and white. <sssss> Although I'll probably not dive into it, this chapter gives you good grounding on the grassroots of photography. <sssss> Other good stuff inside: 1. <sssss> Projects at the end of most every chapter. <sssss> I dare you to do all the project at chapter one and tell me if it will not improve your understanding of what makes a good picture! <sssss> 2. <sssss> Information on digital aspect of photography. <sssss> Although I shoot film slr, I know that one day, I'll want a digital slr so the info on it is nice. <sssss> 3. <sssss> All the illustative pictures are ones that can be done by amateurs! <sssss> In keeping with the beginner's purpose, this is intentional on the part of the authors. <sssss> If you are looking for award winning photos or famous photographers, you wont find it here. <sssss> But the pictures in the book are beautiful in their own right and they drive home the points taught. <sssss> 4. <sssss> Modest studio lighting you can create yourself! <sssss> The principles on the very important aspect of light taught here are very revealing to me. <sssss> The diagram of how to photograph a subject using only your own flash and any old white card to reflect some light is already a good starting point. <sssss> However, I am tempted to give this book 4 stars since I felt that despite it's generous information, attractive layout, highly readable text, and wide pages, the authors skimmed the topic on tricky exposure problems. <sssss> The use of grey cards, spotmeters, and handheld lightmeters to solve these tough light problems were only briefly explained. <sssss> On the other hand, they provided easily applied solutions to our most common exposure problems. <sssss> So I give them the benefit of the doubt that such issues correctly belong to advanced photography topics which might only discourage the wobbly beginner if mentioned here. <sssss> Now that you are aware of it, you will probably do more research on it. <sssss> Meanwhile, a lot of my pictures are already much improved by the application of the principles in the book alone. <sssss> I therefore, highly recommend this book to fellow beginners in photography
~*Katrin286*~ "Katrin"		Le Petit Prince: French Edition: Books: Antoine de Saint-Exup?ry		2		I love this book. <sssss> I have read this book in three different languages (german, english and french). <sssss> It's a completley heartwarming story and not only for kids! <sssss> This book has a lot of great quotes like: "On ne voit bien qu'avec le coeur. <sssss> L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux." <sssss> You really should read it
jojo "jojo"		Building Strong Brands: Books: David A. Aaker		1		This book is more of the same rehashed, recycled, repurposed content from the authors. <sssss> Much of this material is available in any basic marketing text. <sssss> In fact, this book reads strikingly similar to just about any training manual on the basics of branding. <sssss> If you've worked at any of the big agencies: McCann, JWT, Y pppppppppp R, you learn the contents of this book on your first day in about a hour. <sssss> All the cases cited in this book are stale and extremely weak. <sssss> The "editorial reviews" listed above are shill quotes from clients who are cited as "cases" in the book. <sssss> Remember this before you buy: the author, and the firm for whom he works, use this book as nothing more than a lead-generation tool--it's called "thought leadership", a nebulous term used by company to propagate its own way of thinking. <sssss> Save your money. <sssss> Don't become a victim of Prophet's propoganda. <sssss> Buy something with substance like Jean Noel Kapferer.
Jeanette Fedei "Jenny Fedei"		The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book): Books: Don Miguel Ruiz		1		In his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life. <sssss> He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and to always do our best. <sssss> The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents. <sssss> He calls this process "domestication" (p. 6). <sssss> Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection. <sssss> The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives. <sssss> While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. <sssss> In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context. <sssss> Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already an understanding of these principles. <sssss> Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader. <sssss> According to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs. <sssss> When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). <sssss> The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. <sssss> In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents. <sssss> He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements. <sssss> He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13). <sssss> The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, "domesticated" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way. <sssss> This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. <sssss> By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie. <sssss> I would disagree. <sssss> There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values. <sssss> If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don't need parents, teachers, or leaders. <sssss> He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. <sssss> By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny. <sssss> Instead, we become victims of it. <sssss> One of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God." <sssss> He uses it to epitomize the use of "word" as in what one speaks (26). <sssss> Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us". <sssss> This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather "Jesus Christ". <sssss> Christ became flesh and dwelt among us. <sssss> In that same chapter he says that "sin begins with rejection of yourself" (31). <sssss> However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God's will (James 4:7). <sssss> It's not about self, but about disobeying God's ordinances. <sssss> While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept. <sssss> Most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all. <sssss> In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. <sssss> While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal. <sssss> So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz "you are dealing with yourself, not me" (51). <sssss> No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. <sssss> This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims. <sssss> As an American, I'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally. <sssss> According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism. <sssss> It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism. <sssss> When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was "trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). <sssss> I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer. <sssss> Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life. <sssss> He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama. <sssss> Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible. <sssss> Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory. <sssss> In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday. <sssss> In his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best. <sssss> Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned. <sssss> While Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion. <sssss> I can't completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations.
David Eizinger "being"		Camping with the Corps of Engineers: Books: Spurgeon L. Hinkle		2		Here's a book that would have made a great spreadsheet. <sssss> There's a lot of data here, displayed via a string of pictographs. <sssss> Text in this book serves to provide directions only. <sssss> I would have rated this higher if it provided a little background on the location, the history, geographic features, etc
Momoftwosons		Colleges That Change Lives: Books: Loren Pope		2		My son had visited several colleges, and was having a terrible time figuring out which ones he would "fit in" and get the best educational experience from. <sssss> He ended up reading this book and visited a few of them that he liked the descriptions of. <sssss> After applying to, and getting accepted at, four of the schools in this book (and two not in the book) he ended up at Denison University. <sssss> He's in his second year, and just loves it. <sssss> I've always felt a little "indebted" to this book, so I thought I'd leave this review
Robert S. Newman "Bob Newman"		Italians: Books: Luigi Barzini		1		I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind. <sssss> I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character. <sssss> Is there really such a thing as pppppppppp quot;national character pppppppppp quot;? <sssss> People are just too different, too unpredictable. <sssss> How well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you ? <sssss> How well can you predict what people in your own country will do ? <sssss> Would every Italian, if they could write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ? <sssss> I seriously doubt it. <sssss> So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million Italians. <sssss> After reading it, I felt even more strongly that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time. <sssss> An informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ? <sssss> Anthropologists have been concerned, for many years, in getting the pppppppppp quot;inside view pppppppppp quot;--the view of a culture as seen by the person within it. <sssss> While Barzini is indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think. <sssss> This is not a successful gambit. <sssss> Cultures are based on many general factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family, etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific. <sssss> Barzini covers many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by foreigners. <sssss> But nothing really connects. <sssss> There are only superficial, scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp. <sssss> The reader is left with a handful of stereotypes. <sssss> Barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history. <sssss> These sections were well-written and interesting. <sssss> But his portrayal of Italian pppppppppp quot;character pppppppppp quot; is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately, unconvincing. <sssss> Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page. <sssss> Myself, I got pretty tired of those lists. <sssss> If you want to know something useful about Italy, read another book. <sssss> If you just want entertainment, which might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could be for you
Vinicio Valencia		Foundations of Service Level Management: Books: Rick Sturm,Wayne Morris		1		I admit I was impressed by the table of contents of this book, and I admit I had no previous experience with the subject, but sure with the 'real life' of support services for a database company. <sssss> Most of the book is devoted to review commercial software available on the market and for me, this is just enough to be dissapointed. <sssss> There are better commercial magazines or even websites can provide you this information for free... <sssss> Although some formulas and templates looks very interesting (that's why 2 stars), maybe should you consider a help desk book instead
E. Carey "cen2838"		Possible Side Effects: Books: Augusten Burroughs		2		Very good, easy, light pppppppppp funny read! <sssss> Although his best, by far, in my opinion was "Running with Scissors". <sssss> This was an enjoyable read pppppppppp would recommend reading his work if you like David Sedaris, both have a similiar style
J.J. Flintz		E Writing: 21st Century Tools for Effective Communication: Books: Dianna Booher		1		While the author rehashes some basic business writing theory, she consistently fails to follow her own rules: - The text is full of fluff - The style is flippant instead of useful - The lecture style puts you to sleep There are much better books on the subject. <sssss> A textbook approach is necessary for this subject. <sssss> Not this dopey-run-on-crap.
Christiane L. Aubry "Christiane L. Aubry wants to know more"		Deadly Emotions: Understand the Mind-Body-Spirit Connection That Can Heal or Destroy You: Books: Don Colbert		1		All over the place. <sssss> Confusing. <sssss> Poorly organized. <sssss> I was unable to read this book and would love to return it. <sssss> Bad very bad.
James C. Liu "Gyozadude"		Many Children Left Behind: How the No Child Left Behind Act Is Damaging Our Children and Our Schools: Books: Deborah Meier,George Wood		1		This is a classic circle jerk book that consolidates a number of articles from educators and educational researchers who talk about the same thing, and cite each other or similar data and research. <sssss> The authors do write well, so I gave it two stars. <sssss> But it has under/overtones of the same old myths in erroneous educational ideology that is actually the malaise killing our educational system - dump more money into schools; teachers are underpaid and overworked; high stakes standardized testing is bad. <sssss> Folks might be well advised to pick up a copy of Jay P. Greene's "Educational Myths" to run a little de-tox on the stuff they read here
Stacy E. Burrell "Stacy's Blog (See stacyburrell.typepad.com)"		The 100 Best Businesses to Start When You Don't Want to Work Hard Anymore: Books: Lisa Rogak		1		This book is the typical package of business ideas. <sssss> The book gets 2 stars because the few pages devoted to entrepreneurship has very little substance and the information under each idea is sparse and in many cases not helpful. <sssss> In addition, there are numerous ideas that require a tremendous amount of work. <sssss> The author does state that what may be work for one person, may be play to another. <sssss> However, this relates to doing something you enjoy or having a passion where you don't mind putting in the time or work. <sssss> The title suggests that the business ideas listed in the book will not require a great deal of time or effort, which is not the case for many of the ideas(Masonry, Restauranteur for example). <sssss> This book has some value for those that have not read similar books of this type. <sssss> Otherwise, I would take a pass on this one
tweety "tweety"		George Foreman's Big Book of Grilling, Barbecue and Rotisserie: Books: George Foreman,Barbara Witt		1		Just bought a rotisserie and was hoping to find how to use it and good recipes. <sssss> Only found about 4 or 5. <sssss> I would've liken to know different types of meat you could cook in it and for how long you cook it for
Ronald D. Stock		Broker: Books: John Grisham		1		The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read. <sssss> The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe. <sssss> When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending. <sssss> As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory. <sssss> A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about? <sssss> Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion? <sssss> You read the book and decide..
Adriana Villanueva		The News from Paraguay: A Novel: Books: Lily Tuck		1		The most disappointing thing about The News from Paraguay is the beginning, and not precisely because is a bad one, but because in the first chapters of Lily Tuck National Prize awarded novel, there's a hint that could have been better than it turn out to be. <sssss> So I confess that for a few pages (those that engage a reader with a book) I found charming the decimononic story of Ella Lynch, a beautiful widow living in Paris well beyond her means. <sssss> That even when Ella decided to follow hairy Franco -a paraguayan stud- not because his looks, not even for this foolish thing called love, but because he smelled like luxury and power in a faraway land; I still found it a joyable read, but right when she arrived to her privileged life of "querida" of the most powerful man in Paraguay and began to have one baby after another in tumultuous times, The News from Paraguay became boring and I began to skip entire paragraphes until I got to a previsible end. <sssss> Based on true facts, the life of a Paraguayan dictator and his irish mistress; Tuck, who confessed that she never went and wasn't interested in ever going to Paraguay (i think she finally did) can't even get the spanish names right: Mauel, instead of Manuel, Rosaria, instead of Rosario; Iez, instead o Ins. <sssss> What's the deal with the ? <sssss> Maybe I lost something in my not so good english, but I still can't get why, a so so novel like The news from Paraguay, can win a National Prize
Sergio Toporek		Problem of the Media: U.S. Communication Politics in the Twenty-First Century: U.S. Communication Politics in the Twenty-First Century: Books: Robert W. McChesney		2		Extremely well researched. <sssss> McChesney has been a key figure in the "media debate" and he approaches the subject with knowledge and objectivity. <sssss> His disciplined, almost scientific investigation is an example of non-partisan coverage of a crucial issue. <sssss> If only a few politicians were as concerned with the public interest as McChesney, we would be in a better world. <sssss> I am a Mexican citizen so I couldn't care less about U.S. partisan politics, and if you care about the fate of public communications, you shouldn't either. <sssss> This is a problem that affects every country, not just the U.S.A., since the big telecommunication companies are broadcasting all over the World. <sssss> The interest of big advertisers is being protected by U.S. policy and their marketing messages are then blasted everywhere. <sssss> Even the smallest community in the South-Mexican jungles knows Ronald McDonald. <sssss> CNN has Latin editions of their biased news transmitted to most Latin countries. <sssss> As an outsider, I hope the U.S. citizenry will realize that this is not an issue of Democrats vs. Republicans but a World-wide issue of the individual vs. the big corporations. <sssss> In reality they don't care about your political affiliations, as long as you saturate your credit cards to buy their heavily advertised products, you can debate each other to death
Lorraine de DBA		The Database Hacker's Handbook: Defending Database Servers: Books: David Litchfield,Chris Anley,John Heasman,Bill Grindlay		2		Wow - I had to have this book. <sssss> They are right, he explains everything wrong with Oracle and all about vulnerabilities and exploits.
M. R. Estante "http://aralarcalifornia.blogspot.com"		Sex and the Single Girl: Books: Helen Gurley Brown		2		This book was like Madonna's famous photographic book of 1992 when it hit the shelves in the 1960's. <sssss> This is Brown's manifesto on the liberal lifestyle which was spawned in that era. <sssss> Reader beware ... choices and actions have consequence ... and ponder very carefully before being Cosmopolitan long after the expiration date. <sssss> Living it up does NOT mean reckless behavior. <sssss> Values are personal but when one woman's values cause her to act in ways that impose the boundaries onto another (ie - affairs with married men) it is as much an imposition as bible thumping over others' heads. <sssss> People are free to do what they want but if they go down a certain road they have no right to take unwilling others down the path with them. <sssss> Although now dated and updated with Sex and the City - ask yourself if you really want to be wild your whole life. <sssss> Retiring one lifestyle for something stable is a rather good thing when the time is right. <sssss> Helen Gurley Brown has done alot of good for women pursuing careers, enjouing the single life, and having an identity ... but too much too long has a cost. <sssss> Do you really want to be like Brown and her counterpart Hefner ... 80 years old and taking hormones in some attempt at youth?
BabyGirl		Real Men Don't Apologize!: Books: Jim Belushi		1		Please take this to HEART.... <sssss> I love Mr. Belushi's acting, he's funny and all...I have nothing against his career and respect him for making all the changes he did in his life... <sssss> BUT...I cannot say this louder then this: NOT ALL WOMEN ARE THE SAME!!!!!!!!!!!! <sssss> I was reading this, I knew what I was to expect...so I went in with SOME knowledge. <sssss> I love a real man, I LOVE A REAL MAN!! <sssss> I am NOT your a-typical woman and I will kill or die trying to remain myself. <sssss> When ever I see book after book or hear more and more about this ..... <sssss> I just fume because I will be the FIRST to admit WOMEN'S LIB DESTROYED WOMANHOOD! <sssss> BUT and I repeat BUT...NOT ALL WOMEN ARE FOR WOMEN'S LIB AND ALL THE DAMAGE CAUSED IS NOT SUPPORTED BY ALL WOMEN. <sssss> I am destroyed by people like Mr. Belushi because THEY think I am one of the group called 'all women' and am judged because I belong to this group. <sssss> His book is the most selfish book I have ever read and again, do not get me wrong about being a man, I SUPPORT IT AND CAN'T STAND a man who can't be a man.... for ME, money is NOT status, a career is NOT status and marriage does not complete me! <sssss> If you fail at making the money you want, I'll encourage you to lift your spirits and NEVER tell you what job to do...if you don't have the money to take me out or buy me anything, I don't judge the quality of who you are, I will enjoy a night in front of the dvd player with you and I'M HAPPY! <sssss> I don't ask you to call because I'm checking up on YOU, I ask you to call and let me know you're safe....I don't snoop in your stuff because I'm NOSEY, I respect your privacy because I TRUST you - give me reason to stand up and NOT take your crap and I will, but ONLY after I shower you with unconditional love and acceptance because I GIVE IT TO YOU, and if that still hasn't reached you, all I can do is then stand up for myself where my man should be protecting me. <sssss> Yes, chivalry IS the key to this girls heart, but you better have a set to back that up too! <sssss> Your friends are my friends and I love them because I love you and you love them...nothing more, but they sure do take by destroying us since they don't have the 'us' in their own lives... <sssss> I SUPPORT and WISH THERE WERE more real men out there...there are only two wants from this woman to her man 1-don't cheat on me and lie to my face, I NEED THAT SECURITY (pay attention, my security does NOT come from YOUR paycheck, it comes from your arm wrapped around me, PROTECTING me with your love) and 2- it is YOUR job to take care of us and when you can't, I am right there to get your back NOT to get in your way, NOT to diminish you, but to HELP YOU when you say you need my help. <sssss> That did not cost you your friends, did not cost a penny and it did not cost you your freedoms as a man. <sssss> I GIVE FREELY, LOVINGLY, UNCONDITIONALLY and ALWAYS not because of the notches on your bedpost, not because it cost you a dime, not because you did it MY way, not because you gave up one dang thing - I gave you every reason to WANT to give me your arm around me and your WANT to protect me. <sssss> Two things is all I need to give you an entire lifetime of love, honor, RESPECT and every ounce of my body to you...FREELY...got it??? <sssss> I am halfway through the book and realized that yeah, I love one of the biggest jerks out there because of who he's become, I will love him til the day I die and will always and I mean ALWAYS give him that love, RESPECT as a man and honor him as MY man....because 'I' want to change ME to be a better woman, not because he got whipped into what I wanted him to be! <sssss> NOT ALL WOMEN FIT THE BILL OF TRUE WAMONHOOD but I sure am dang proud of myself that I strive for it
Victor Goh		Enterprise J2ME: Developing Mobile Java Applications: Books: Michael Juntao Yuan		2		I am an experienced Java programmer. <sssss> This book together with the NetBeans IDE allowed me to come up with a J2ME application in less than a week. <sssss> The examples in the book is a great resource for learning to write J2ME applications. <sssss> I learn best when I'm coding. <sssss> In my case, I used the source from the PeekAndPick RSS Reader to come up with my J2ME text reader. <sssss> The program has been heavily modified since, but the book provided sample code that was a great starting point for my learning.
Michael B. Crutcher		Inside U.S.A: Books: John Gunther		2		John Gunther's INSIDE U.S.A. comes as close to time travel as we are likely to get, hurling us back to the America of 1947, as he explores, state by state, the people, politics, issues, passions and fads that make up our country. <sssss> Written with great energy and insight, Gunther captures an America justly proud of its WWII success, still unsure of its role in the world, and populated by fascinating characters like Mayor LaGuardia of New York, Governor Saltonstall of Massachusetts and Boss Hague of Jersey City. <sssss> Gunther describes regional characteristics that persist today. <sssss> He captures aspects of America that are gone,l never to return (an pppppppppp quot;industrial pppppppppp quot; nation based on coal, iron ore and steel.) <sssss> And he foresees issues that dog America to this day -- the pppppppppp quot;Negro problem pppppppppp quot; (actually, the pppppppppp quot;White problem. <sssss> pppppppppp quot;) He condemns the segregationist society he finds in America, so inconsistent with its lofty ideals. <sssss> As you can tell, I loved this book. <sssss> It's very hefty -- but every time you are about to put it down, Gunther comes up with another amazing fact or interesting sidelight that keeps you reading. <sssss> All this said, Gunther does concentrate on the (a) historical, (b) political and (c) economic side of things. <sssss> You won't find much here about the arts or science. <sssss> But it is amazing a single individual could have compiled this much data and presented it so interestingly
Hoke		The Way of the Traveler: Making Every Trip a Journey of Self-Discovery: Books: Joseph Dispenza		1		Have you ever met a person where every single thing that happens to them is a spiritual awakening? <sssss> The kind of person that can't go to the bathroom without making some sort of journal entry of the new vistas they discovered? <sssss> Well that is the kind of mentality you get with this book. <sssss> You can't simply look at a sunset and be in awe of nature or God. <sssss> No you need to relate to it and make it a part of you. <sssss> I am avery spiritual person and love traveling. <sssss> I have traveled all over the world and feel complete when I do so. <sssss> Reading this book did the one thing I never thought was possible, it put me off of traveling. <sssss> Fortunately, the feeling passed quickly. <sssss> I will not make little travel shrines. <sssss> I will not take little spiritual trips across my living room. <sssss> I will not follow this persons advice. <sssss> And this book is going nowhere near my rucksack. <sssss> Sorry, I am too stoic for this book. <sssss> I would recommend people read books about the places they want to go. <sssss> Learn their culture and a little bit of their language. <sssss> Don't worry about the trip just go on it. <sssss> My passport is the only material possession I truly value.
A Reader		Shantaram: Library Edition: Books: Gregory David Roberts,Humphrey Bower		1		Unfotrunately Shantaram did not grab my imagination at all. <sssss> Nor did I find it emotionally satisfying. <sssss> I realize Shataram is meant to be a kind of Bollywood story - over the top, flowery, cliched etc. <sssss> but the Bollywood movies I've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying, despite their soppyness etc. <sssss> Shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story.
Seehorse72		Journal of a Solitude: Books: May Sarton		2		If you're into reading memoirs, this is exceptional. <sssss> Her clarity of thought and her ability to portray her feelings into words is unsurpassed, in my opinion. <sssss> I enjoy her prose so very much. <sssss> I can find myself relating to so many of her feelings and thoughts despite the difference of age and time. <sssss> This is a great read
"emily328"		The Tenth Good Thing About Barney (Tenth Good Thing about Barney Nrf): Books: Judith Viorst,Erik Blegvad		1		I work in a school library and as a cat lover am always seeking out the cat books. <sssss> This one caught my eye and I was expecting something wonderful. <sssss> I found the story to be hopeless and defeating. <sssss> How sad the only comfort the father has to offer is composting tips and the last memory the child has to hold is that of a decomposing cat. <sssss> I'm no censor, but two thumbs way down. <sssss> Also, if you are looking for something wonderful for pet loss, try Cynthia Rylant's, Cat Heaven
K. Patterson		Positive Discipline for Teenagers (Positive Discipline): Books: Jane Ed.D. Nelsen,Lynn Lott		1		I did not like the book. <sssss> It did have some interesting points to consider, but it did not seem like discipline to me. <sssss> I am more of a Love and Logic fan. <sssss> I think kids cannot always see the natural consequences of their own behavior (or don't care) until far into the future and must sometimes have consequences imposed upon them, which this book says not to do. <sssss> I just don't agree with it
Chino Fernandez "techtor"		When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough: Books: Kushner		2		Beautiful. <sssss> Kushner attacks many of the world's carnal attitudes and inputs thoughts and principles that help combat them. <sssss> Though he is not Christian, this book is full of principles that help you avoid being conformed to this world and be transformed by the renewing of your mind
Quinn D. Hubbard		The Photoshop CS2 Book for Digital Photographers (Voices That Matter): Books: Scott Kelby		1		First off, so much of the copy is devoted to his horrible sense of humor, imagine a junior high school student "acting big" to impress his friends with jokes, that type of annoying bravura humor is simply unrelenting throughout the book. <sssss> It is filler. <sssss> The illustrations are sized so big the actual technical content of the book is quite low. <sssss> Just more filler. <sssss> Finally, all the techniques in the book can be found during normal operation of PS, or at worst a few internet searches. <sssss> I think this book is over-priced and I wish I could return it. <sssss> Caveat emptor
Mom of 2...2 pppppppppp under "Mom of 2...2 pppppppppp under"		Feeding Your Allergic Child: Happy Food for Healthy Kids: Books: Elisa Meyer		2		I love this cookbook pppppppppp use it all the time! <sssss> My daughter has many allergies (tree nuts included) so we haven't been able to use all the recipes, but those that we have are wonderful! <sssss> I keep checking back, hoping to see another book by this author, but haven't found any so far. <sssss> As for the "rantings" spoken about in another review....I read the book cover to cover and didn't find anything that fits that description. <sssss> I enjoyed Ms. Meyer's stories of her children and her 'journey' and appreciate her having shared it. <sssss> Thanks
Harsh Critic		Abide with Me: A Novel: Books: Elizabeth Strout,Gerrianne Raphael		1		This is a very bad book. <sssss> It is poorly written, the characters are caricatures in misery, and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter, who suffers in silence after the devastating, and, to her, mysterious, death of her mother. <sssss> Her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter. <sssss> He is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child's behavior, which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response, rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion. <sssss> He fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break. <sssss> I couldn't finish this. <sssss> It is drivel
Brett Steenbarger		Trading Risk: Enhanced Profitability through Risk Control: Books: Kenneth L. Grant		2		In his book Trading Risk, Ken Grant draws upon his experience as a risk manager for Tudor Investments and SAC Capital to create an insightful and surprisingly non-technical guide for traders and portfolio managers. <sssss> As Director of Trader Development at a large proprietary trading house, I have been impressed with the role risk management plays in the success of the firm and its individual traders. <sssss> Moreover, this is a scalable difference: risk management very much impacts the outcomes of individual trades, results of trading days, and performance across entire quarters. <sssss> Where I believe Grant has admirably succeeded is in documenting that risk management is much more than simply "cutting your losses". <sssss> Trading Risk systematically breaks down elements of the process of managing trades, from the establishment of concrete objectives to the allocation of risk capital to specific trades and the use of correlation analysis in evaluating trading results. <sssss> His discussions of adjusting portfolio exposure and evaluating the risk components of individual trades are highly practical and encourage a rigor of self-analysis that is rarely practiced. <sssss> Perhaps an example from my own work with traders that overlaps Grant's ideas might be illustrative. <sssss> I encourage traders to keep a log of all their trades that tracks time of day, position taken, position size, holding period, and profit/loss (P/L). <sssss> Changes to the position are also documented, as traders scale into or out of trades. <sssss> From this record, we can evaluate a host of performance statistics, such as position sizing as a function of market volume/volatility, the correlation of profitability with trade size/holding period, and patterns of activity within the trading day. <sssss> While Grant's background is with portfolio management-appropriate to a manager who is holding a basket of positions in a variety of equities-his ideas are easily adaptable to the intraday trader who is trading a single instrument. <sssss> By viewing each trade during a day as an element of that day's "portfolio", we can ask important questions about the mix of position sizes, overall directional bias, and the management of volatility as a function of trade capital/loss limits. <sssss> Written in an engaging style with bits of humor interspersed, Trading Risk ends with a practical chapter that summarizes the book's major points. <sssss> He explains the importance of developing and modifying trading plans, defining one's trading "edge", judiciously allocating risk capital, and improving performance "at the margin". <sssss> This latter point is a particularly neglected element in risk management. <sssss> For the active, large trader, the ability to squeeze the extra tick out of trades is frequently the difference between a winning day and a losing one. <sssss> Superior traders have an ability to read the very short-term patterns of price change and momentum to determine when it is prudent to hit the bid or let the market go offer in exiting a position. <sssss> At such points, good risk management and good trading are indistinguishable. <sssss> I have few reservations about Grant's book. <sssss> A text of 250 pages is not going to provide many workbook-like examples, something that would help the more mathematically challenged master the ideas of value-at-risk and correlation analysis. <sssss> Small retail traders who trade only occasionally will probably find the risk metrics less compelling than larger, active traders or portfolio managers, though the basic principles emphasized in the last chapter certainly apply to any serious trader. <sssss> Considering the absence of serious discussions of risk management in the popular trading literature, Trading Risk is a major contribution and a worthy addition to a library. <sssss> I plan to use it as a core reading in our training program for new traders, perhaps the best endorsement I can give.
Kate Smart "burnabyheights"		The Organized Home: Design Solutions for Clutter-Free Living: Books: Casey Ellis,Randall Koll		1		This book has taken photo after photo straight out of the Ikea catalogue! <sssss> Obviously, the authors have decided that they have nothing to offer and opt instead to refer to Ikea's design and storage ideas. <sssss> This book actually put me in a bad mood. <sssss> Listen up folks, THE IKEA CATALOGUE IS FREE. <sssss> Do yourselves a favour and pick one up, because none of these so-called "organization" books have anything to teach you that cannot be found at your local Ikea store. <sssss> These authors should be fired. <sssss> Shame on both of them
C. H Mitchum		Two Dollar Bill: A Stone Barrington Novel: Books: Stuart Woods		1		Since I listened to this as a cd it is difficult to comment on the book as Tony Roberts performance was so bad, it was impossible to follow the story line. <sssss> He read so slowly that it seems he received a bonus if he could stretch this little book into 7 excruciating cds which he did. <sssss> In addition to the slooooow reading, his characterization were completely over the top. <sssss> Dino sounded like a moron and "Billy Bob" well like a Texas moron. <sssss> And what about Billy Bob, that cliche name eptomized the whole weak little story. <sssss> Skip this this one or prepare to suffer
Dennis Littrell		Doyle Brunson's Super System II: Books: Doyle Brunson		1		"The Most Anticipated Book in the History of Poker!" <sssss> exclaims a blurb on the cover. <sssss> Well, if so, I can tell you that a lot of people have been, or are going to be, VERY disappointed. <sssss> Comparing the classic Super/System from 1978 with this book is, to paraphrase Mark Twain, like comparing lightning to the lightning bug. <sssss> This book is more of a tribute to Doyle Brunson than it is "A Course in Power Poker." <sssss> Johnny Chan writes a fairly vacuous Preface in which he lauds Brunson, but doesn't say anything about how to play. <sssss> Then we have Brunson's Introduction in which he tells us mostly about the contributors to the first Super/System. <sssss> Next there is an autobiographical sketch by Brunson entitled, "My Story." <sssss> (If you want a book that gives the real flavor of Brunson's "story," get a copy of According to Doyle (1984). <sssss> It contains 47 chapters in which Brunson recalls his early days and life on the road.) <sssss> Following "My Story" is a short history of Texas Hold'em by Crandell Addington which isn't much, and then there is the first chapter that could actually be considered part of a course in power poker. <sssss> This would be 43 tips from Mike Caro cribbed from his lectures and books. <sssss> However the tips are hardly "exclusive" for SuperSystem2 as claimed. <sssss> Beginning with Caro's cute but now very familiar, "In the beginning, everything was even money," most or all of the tips have been recycled. <sssss> For example, Tip #18, page 146, "WHEN A FREQUENT BETTOR CHECKS TO YOU...don't bluff" is just about the same as Tip #10 "Seldom bluff if frequent bluffers have checked into you" found on page 137 in Caro's Fundamental Secrets of Winning Poker (1996). <sssss> In fact Caro even recycles his "exclusive" tips in this very book. <sssss> Tip #31 says that PLAYERS STARING AWAY...are almost always more dangerous than players staring at you," while Tip #40 says in part that "OPPONENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BET OR RAISE IF THEY ARE: ...(3) staring away." <sssss> Jennifer Harman's chapter on limit hold'em is so ordinary that it's remedial. <sssss> There's not even a hint of anything new. <sssss> There are a number of books on the market that cover the same ground much more thoroughly. <sssss> I especially recommend Small Stakes Hold'em: Winning Big with Expert Play (2004) by Ed Miller, David Sklansky and Mason Malmuth or anything by Sklansky. <sssss> Also her insistence on referring to hands backwards, "6-7" (e.g., on p. 252) instead of "76" is annoying and contrary to a well-established convention. <sssss> And the caricatures by Russ Braun! <sssss> They are so bland and flattering that each may have passed prior inspection by the subject's mother. <sssss> Comparing these to the witty and sharp work by Stan Hunt in the original is like comparing a cliche to something alive and vital. <sssss> Brunson doesn't even look like himself. <sssss> Here he's just a generic, smiling, dough boy kind of guy--except in the small, clever, lifelike drawing gracing page 7 which WAS drawn by Stan Hunt, copied from the first book. <sssss> Good are the chapters on Omaha and Stud Eight-or-Better. <sssss> However, although Brunson has Bobby Baldwin billed as his author of the Omaha Eight-or-Better chapter, actually it was written (as acknowledged) by Mark Gregorich. <sssss> He does a good job of introducing the game and giving some of the strategies, and I'm sure he is a fine player, but what about Bobby Baldwin? <sssss> Well, as CEO of Mirage Corporation and President of the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, Bobby is far, far too busy to write the chapter himself. <sssss> So he just lent his name and his supervision. <sssss> Can you spell R-I-P-O-F-F? <sssss> Perhaps the most embarrassing part of the book is Doyle's chapter on no limit hold'em. <sssss> It is little more than a reprise of the same chapter in the first book published 28 years ago. <sssss> Also recycled is the section on "Colorful Names of Various Hold'em Hands" on pages 628 and 629. <sssss> The dated references to Raquel Welch ("38") and Broderick Crawford ("10-4") seem more than a little out of touch. <sssss> Indeed, this book is nostalgic tribute to Brunson and the great success he and the original book achieved. <sssss> And that is a shame, because this book is billed as an exciting event in the history of the publication of books on poker when in fact it is something hastily put together to flatter Brunson and, hopefully, the pocketbook of those involved. <sssss> One final thing: there is a Glossary, suitable for beginners, which is okay as it defines such things a "Deuce," "Flush," "Four of a Kind," etc., but seems a little basic for "A Course in Power Poker." <sssss> Worse though is this definition of a "Cold Deck": "A term often used to describe the deck by players who feel they're not getting enough playable or winning hands." <sssss> Players may indeed remark that "the deck is cold," but the origin of the term comes from the fact that a stacked deck used by cheaters that is switched into the game tends to be "cold" to the touch since it has not been handled since it was stacked. <sssss> Bottom line: pass
H. Male "southpaw32"		Mrs. McGinty's Dead/(Variant Title = Blood Will Tell): Books: Agatha Christie		1		Hmmm. <sssss> I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. <sssss> She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. <sssss> Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. <sssss> I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. <sssss> Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the pppppppppp quot;who, where and why pppppppppp quot; were finally revealed in the end. <sssss> I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. <sssss> I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. <sssss> Very disappointing. <sssss> Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd
Fiona Manning "Hawaiian Eye"		Shopaholic pppppppppp Sister: Books: Sophie Kinsella		1		This fourth installment of Becky's trying tribulations is the worst. <sssss> The qualty has plummeted from passable fun to total embarrassment. <sssss> I don't understand how Kinsella's editor didn't draw the line (and the red pencil) at the litany of shopping expeditions. <sssss> And her endless, excrutitating 'inner' reflections. <sssss> Becky's exploits aren't amusing anymore. <sssss> Her purchases on her honeymoon aren't wacky. <sssss> They're bewildering. <sssss> For a shopaholic with supposedly good taste, Becky buys the ugliest sounding things on her travels and then flogs them all on Ebay once home in England. <sssss> And oh yes, then she discovers a long lost sister. <sssss> That situation is about as believable as three designer wedding dresses and two weddings from the previous book. <sssss> And then Bex and her sister wind up on a rock rescued by Tarquin in his personal helicopter. <sssss> I am not making this up. <sssss> It's all there in the book. <sssss> And none of it is even remotely entertaining. <sssss> And now God help us, Becky is pregnant. <sssss> AARRGGGH!
Guacamole		The Golden Compass (His Dark Materials, Book 1): Books: Philip Pullman		2		If you're an easily offended religious fanatic who's always looking for the vaguest insult or contradiction to your beliefs... <sssss> I guess you shouldn't read this. <sssss> (Actually, you could probably read this one and just skip the sequels.) <sssss> But if you're anyone else (of any age) who enjoys a really awesome story with great characters, adventure, danger, fantastic visual writing, and not a single boring moment, (well... it might take a little effort to get past the beginning, but that's coming from a really impatient reader) then yeah. <sssss> Go for it. <sssss> Because there's just nothing that compares
Chris Long		Debt Free Living: Books: Larry Burkett		2		This book was the best financial planning book I have ever read. <sssss> It had real life situations that helped out alot. <sssss> I didn't realize how much in debt I was until I read this. <sssss> I didn't have a problem with making payments and even paying extra on them. <sssss> But I never planned for a disaster or loss of a job. <sssss> If you spend a couple of years paying off your debt, that is years of happiness just knowing you don't others money. <sssss> This book helped me realize this. <sssss> Thank You Larry Burkett for this and all of your other books, God was really with you during your writting
Oleg S		Econometric Analysis (5th Edition): Books: William H. Greene		2		This book is inspiring! <sssss> The coverage is very broad and it can serve as a handbook for graduate students. <sssss> Even the hardest bits of econometrics are explained in an easy to understand way. <sssss> My personal favourites are chapters 16, 17 and 18. <sssss> I will definetely buy a hardcover of the next edition of this econometrics masterpiece. <sssss> Summing up, it's one of my favourite books.
Jill Malter		War Is a Force that Gives Us Meaning: Books: Chris Hedges		1		This book belongs in the Fantasy section of the library. <sssss> Let's start with the question of Israel's borders. <sssss> Do some folks say that these borders ought to be the Nile and Euphrates rivers? <sssss> After all, Israel is kind of small. <sssss> Doesn't it need, um, a tiny bit more land? <sssss> Well, Israel may need a little more land. <sssss> But almost nobody is proposing anything like this. <sssss> I see very few Israeli politicians demanding even all of the West Bank, let alone all of Jordan. <sssss> And as for the Nile to the Euphrates, this is pretty much exclusively anti-Zionist propaganda. <sssss> There's a nice article by Daniel Pipes in the March, 1994 issue of Middle East Quarterly that goes into this in some detail, in case anyone cares. <sssss> Yes, we've seen propaganda before. <sssss> In the 1930s, some Germans claimed that the Jews were planning to take over the whole world. <sssss> Now, what do we see in this book? <sssss> What we see in this book is Chris Hedges quoting someone as saying that Israel allows state-funded religious schools to preach that Jewish rule should extend from the Nile to the Euphrates. <sssss> Is there any connection between this and truth? <sssss> Yes, there's a connection. <sssss> You see, in the Bible (in Deuteronomy), Moses says at one point that Israel's borders shall run from the river Euphrates to the "western sea" (presumably, the Mediterranean, but definitely not the Nile). <sssss> Of course, someone might want to ask a Jewish authority about what the Bible says. <sssss> It turns out that there's much more detailed material in the Book of Numbers, and that is what Pipes says religious Jews are taught is Biblical. <sssss> And that specifies a much smaller Israel. <sssss> In addition, it is quite a leap to go from Biblical borders, no matter how large or small, to preaching that Jews ought to rule such an area today. <sssss> Hedges is doing us a big disservice here. <sssss> You may want to check all this for yourselves. <sssss> In addition, Hedges has an exciting description of the Battle of Khafji (which took place during Desert Storm). <sssss> Some people who were really there dispute it, however. <sssss> You may want to check that as well. <sssss> We also see Hedges describe the behavior of Israeli soldiers in Gaza on June 17, 2001. <sssss> Now, remember that these soldiers are trained to obey orders. <sssss> Their superiors know that Israel can't afford unnecessary violence. <sssss> The soldiers are there to protect lives, not to hurt or kill others. <sssss> And in fact, it turns out to be true that in the fighting between Jews and Arabs, the Jews (as expected) have rarely been guilty of gratuitous violence. <sssss> On the other hand, the Arabs, who have rather different goals and constraints, have displayed quite a bit of bad behavior. <sssss> Nevertheless, in spite of logic and facts to the contrary, in this book, Hedges comes up with the following (as usual, I encourage you to verify for yourselves what the truth is, and you might want to start by finding out how many people died that day and who they were): "I had seen children shot in other conflicts that I had covered - death squads gunned them down in El Salvador and Guatemala, mothers with infants were lined up and massacred in Algeria, and Serb snipers put children in their sights and watched them crumple onto the pavement in Sarajevo - but I had never watched soldiers entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport." <sssss> Well! <sssss> What is it about Israelis that could lead them to behave in such a surprising manner? <sssss> Hedges speculates that exposure to all sorts of nasty reading material about the Holocaust has perverted these unfortunate young men. <sssss> Well, I'm perfectly prepared to believe that men and women from all nations have been exposed to all sorts of reading material. <sssss> But I don't buy Hedges' absurd conclusion at all. <sssss> Nor do I buy any of what he says about the behavior of the soldiers. <sssss> And no, I'm not in denial. <sssss> If you believe Hedges, I think you may be in denial, though! <sssss> I'll stop here. <sssss> Anyone capable of saying what I've quoted from Hedges so far is capable of saying anything. <sssss> We readers do not need this.
Sarrah		50,001 Best Baby Names: Books: Diane Stafford		1		This book has a lot of names. <sssss> I'll give it that. <sssss> But, there are some relatively common names that are missing. <sssss> And so many invented names. <sssss> My favorite of the invented names are Schmoopie and Poogie. <sssss> As if these names will show up on a birth certificate!! <sssss> The definitions/origins of the names are poorly researched and confusing. <sssss> For the name "Cowboy" the book tells you it means "country" for the name "Country" it tells you it means "western". <sssss> Not that either of those is a standard name, but, for "words as names" aren't you going to pick it because it has meaning to you? <sssss> Also, the lists are totally false, something the author (if you can call her that) made up while sitting around drinking with her buddies. <sssss> And some of the names on these lists aren't even found later in the book. <sssss> (ex. <sssss> Lynus on the "Party animals" list) I wish I had held out for a trip to the bookstore instead of just picking up the first book I saw at Walmart. <sssss> I figured with so many names I would find one I liked, but I am just so distracted by all the junk that I will never find a good name here.
Julie Lovisa		Walk Away the Pounds: The Breakthrough 6-Week Program That Helps You Burn Fat, Tone Muscle, and Feel Great Without Dieting: Books: Leslie Sansone		2		I am a total addict of Leslie Sansone's Walk Away programs - I had many exercise videos, but never stuck to anything until I found her energizing, fun, and most of all easy workouts. <sssss> In her personal, talking-to-you-like-a-best-friend style, Leslie shows you how regular exercise benefits you in all ways from your health to your body to your mind and then presents her easy to follow basic workout which consists of three walking steps that are interchanged and sometimes modified while doing the program. <sssss> There is no dieting in this program! <sssss> She is a strong proponent of getting up and moving to better your life and shows it here by offering a few modifications you can make to your way of eating to help you lose weight, but no real diet, which I think is great! <sssss> It helps to show that the real health factor is getting the exercise you need, not feeling deprived of the food you want which is why many diets fail. <sssss> She has many success stories to motivate you peppered throughout the book and closes with a discussion about how stress affects your life and how you can beat it through exercise. <sssss> I love Leslie! <sssss> She is personable, motivating, and a great teacher - I am forever grateful to her for getting this former couch potato, at-home mom to stick to an exercise routine that I know will always benefit my life
Filth Reload "Fort Delilah"		What Good Are the Arts?: Books: John Carey		1		This was expected. <sssss> A fanatic relativist dismembers absolutist views into little irrelevant pieces. <sssss> Our civilization has been jumping between absolutism/universalism and relativism ever since its decline, with only a few people realizing a third alternative. <sssss> With this whole book based on a flawed definition, it is a pointless and utterly tedious read
Rebecca McEldowney "author of 'Soul of Flesh: A Novel of the Hungarian Revolution"		The Historian: Books: Elizabeth Kostova		1		I'm at page 116 right now. <sssss> The writing is lovely, the specifics dense, and the sense of place rich. <sssss> If the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say, "I just can't go on with this story!" <sssss> I'm going to throw the book at the wall. <sssss> Also, so many embarrassing little holes. <sssss> If I were a librarian I would say, "So Dracula's checked out. <sssss> Go to a bookstore. <sssss> Every bookstore in the country has a copy." <sssss> And if I were the cat, I would know I was a goner the second I appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph(you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you're going to fire it). <sssss> Lastly, it seems like Dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them. <sssss> Unless "Dracula" is related to our heroine--that would be good. <sssss> Will read a bit more. <sssss> . <sssss> .
Simon Withers		iCon Steve Jobs, the Greatest Second Act in the History of Business: Books: Jeffrey S. Young,Barton Biggs		1		A disappointing book about a fabulous story. <sssss> The book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and, if you look at the chapter notes, this appears to be how it was researched. <sssss> There are little irritants, such as referring to Steve Jobs as "Steve" as if he's a close friend, but the big problem is that it recounts a number of interesting incidents in Steve Jobs' career while missing the main story. <sssss> And what a fantastic story that is. <sssss> I hope that someone has written a decent account of Steve Jobs' life because I would like to read it. <sssss> One thing is certain: "iCon" sure ain't it.
"cotham1025"		Through a Night of Horrors: Voices from the 1900 Galveston Storm: Books: Casey Edward Greene,Shelly Henley Kelly		2		This is the best book available on the Great Storm of 1900 and its effect on Galveston, Texas. <sssss> An unbelievable amount of research obviously went into it. <sssss> Very well written. <sssss> Highly recommended
Happy Hoppy		Sleep No More: Books: Greg Iles,Dick Hill		1		I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. <sssss> I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one! <sssss> Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much. <sssss> So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. <sssss> WRONG! <sssss> The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests. <sssss> I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). <sssss> I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless. <sssss> As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. <sssss> I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book. <sssss> In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles. <sssss> Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers.
Christopher J. Abate "Jpjr"		Den of Thieves: Untold Story of Men Who Plundered Wall St pppppppppp Chase Brought Down: Books: James B. Stewart		1		Anyone that knows anything about Milken knows that the guy created millions of jobs, and contributed much more to society than people like James Stewart, who often act like parasites at the expense of others. <sssss> And what about Milken's life after this whole affair? <sssss> I wonder what Stewart will write about in the sequel, since Milken has taken on a life of philanthropy basically unrivaled, and certainly contributes more to this country than most. <sssss> Milken's creation of a liquid market for junk bonds allowed credit risk to be redistributed throughout the capital markets, effectively creating more capital, more jobs, and more wealth creation. <sssss> Anyone up and coming in IB, or looking to inform themselves of the 80's capital movement, please at least check out some other perspectives on the era. <sssss> Note: These comments don't apply to Boesky or the arbs who were doing nothing but breaking the law. <sssss> I would argue a strong distinction between Milken and most of the other characters in this book
E. Marvin		What Remains: A Memoir of Fate, Friendship, and Love: Books: Carole Radziwill		2		I just finished the book last night, crying as I read the last few pages. <sssss> I guess since Carole Radziwill and I are the same age and share a lot of the same interests helped capture me into this memoir and unable to put it down. <sssss> It also gives you some unheard stories of the famous family. <sssss> I felt like I knew Carolyn Bessette Kennedy better through this story rather than the tabloid press. <sssss> She was a delightful and woman, filled with life, which makes her ending even more tragic. <sssss> The book honors a beautiful friendship and a marriage tested by CANCER. <sssss> It pays homage to Anthony Radizwill as well as John and Carolyn Kennendy as it lets you see them as real people rather than tabloid fodde
Peter Zink		Posing for Portrait Photography: A Head-to-Toe Guide: Books: Jeff Smith		1		I bought this book to try to learn some useful poses for my subjects, and given most other people's ratings, I decided to give it a try. <sssss> However, upon opening the book my first thought was, "these all look like high school yearbook photos", which is exacltly what they are. <sssss> It seems that that's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market. <sssss> His main concern, which he stresses throughout the book, is creating a "saleable picture", and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom, since she's usually the one with final say over the pictures. <sssss> A better title for this book would have been, "How To Take High School Senior Pictures". <sssss> Even then, most of the pictures are not very good, both in their original execution and in their print quality for this book. <sssss> In addition, the poses are unnatural and awkward looking, and the book is filled with typos and grammatical errors. <sssss> To be fair, the author does suggest some useful basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject, but there is really very little useful information here. <sssss> So, if you're interested in learning how to take pictures that look like a Sears portrait, this may be the book for you. <sssss> However, if you really want to learn some useful techniques for posing your subjects in a more natural or more artistic manner, I'd steer clear of this book
Dave Holwill		At Large: The Strange Case of the World's Biggest Internet Invasion: Books: David H. Freedman,Charles C. Mann		2		It is not often I reread a book but this was well worth it. <sssss> It is the true story of a pppppppppp quot;cracker pppppppppp quot; who set about trying to break into computer networks and how people from system administrators to the FBI try to stop him. <sssss> Written in the style of a thriller, you are swept along in amazement at the exploits of the cracker. <sssss> If this doesn't alter your view of internet security nothing will. <sssss> On the down side it becomes a chore trying to keep all the players straight in one's head, it is indeed a cast of many. <sssss> Although somewhat geeky at times and it does help to have some background in computer networking it won't prevent you from enjoying what is surely the most bizarre story of internet hacking you will read
Chloe Symes "Clo"		Heartland #18: New Beginnings (Heartland): Books: Lauren Brooke		1		This book is not my favourite in the Heartland series. <sssss> It is not even really about heartland, the main part of the book is based in Occanumba. <sssss> Also, there are hardly any horses in this book, just Maverick (who is only a minor part) and a tiny bit of Spindleberry and Albatross. <sssss> It is mainly about Carey and her mood swings. <sssss> It is also a bit unrealistic, as Amy comes out eith long, involved, emotional speeches that no teenager i know would blab on about! <sssss> The way she talks is more like a middle aged psychatrist! <sssss> I also think that the most recent books have been targeted at a younger audience. <sssss> At the start of the series i would class them as 'young adult' material, but now they are just for kids who like horses. <sssss> She is supposed to be going out with Ty but they never seem to kiss much or do anything romantic. <sssss> In this book he goes to Occanumba with Amy and they don't even get off together once! <sssss> Even though they are in the forest all alone at one point, with no adults around. <sssss> All in all this book is ok, but rather boring. <sssss> Nothing much happens, i thought Amy might at least have an arguement with Joni when she takes over with Spindleberry, but no, Amy has gone middle-aged and doesn't do anything. <sssss> I would only recommend buying this book if you are a total heartland fan. <sssss> Carey is really annoying at the start and the horses hardly feature at all. <sssss> I hope the last 2 books in the series are better, because this one was rather pants.
Eric Kent		Information Security Risk Analysis: Books: Thomas R. Peltier		2		This is a great book about risk. <sssss> Very valuable. <sssss> Written in a clear and easy to understand style. <sssss> A bargain at 5 times the price. <sssss> You can't get this info and data anywhere else
Tesibria		Goodbye, Darkness: A Memoir of the Pacific War: Books: William Manchester		2		William Manchester, the greatest narrative historian of or time, provides a vivid account of his experiences in the Pacific Theatre during World War II. <sssss> As with all of his books, we see, hear, smell, taste, and feel the experiences with him, as if we were there. <sssss> Although more personal, of course, than his other narrative histories, Goodbye Darkness provides the same factual details, and each sentence, paragraph, and chapter is crafted with the same beauty and skill that is Manchester's hallmark. <sssss> An amazing memoir by a truly great writer.
Nisha Martin		Getting Thin and Loving Food: 200 Easy Recipes to Take You Where You Want to Be: Books: Kathleen Daelemans		2		I really like this book. <sssss> It's simple to follow instructions, and there is good advice all the way thru it. <sssss> Everything from the author's mom's advice to what to do to jazz up a low fat, high flavor recipe to make it more flexible, tastier, or fancy enough for company. <sssss> I like KD's tv show on Food tv, and I liked her first book, this book is better than the first. <sssss> I am eating more healthfully(Is that a word?) <sssss> and keep taking the small steps KD recommends to keep doing even better. <sssss> I highly recommend the book
J. Berg "Red Ink"		Intensity: Books: Dean Koontz		2		I could not put this book down! <sssss> I was so amazed with this shocking story that I bought several copies for gifts. <sssss> Reading this book was like watching a scary movie.
"azucarblanca"		At the Root of This Longing: Reconciling a Spiritual Hunger and a Feminist Thirst: Books: Carol L. Flinders		1		The author is certainly writing for a target audience.......as one other reviewer said, white, upper-middle-class, female would-be mystics. <sssss> I found the stories of life on the commune mind-numbing (then again, I was born in Berkeley in 1970, so that hippie commune kumbayah stuff reminds me of eating carob when I was a kid) and the rest of what I did manage to read alienating.......zzzzzzzzzzzz.......I am not saying this is a bad book at all, just that it's focus was so narrow that it completely lost my interest. <sssss> The language was so fuzzy and woo-woo that it just irritated my Gen X (for lack of a better word) postpunk sensibility. <sssss> It's a shame, too, as I was really looking forward to this book and hoping it would assist me in reconciling my own struggle between feminism and spirituality. <sssss> C'est la vie
Clive Ong		Plan for Profitability!: How to Write a Strategic Business Plan: Books: Lee E., Jr. Hargrave		2		Mr Hargrave's book contains practical guidance to developing a sound, realistic and executable strategic business plan. <sssss> Drawing from his wealth of business experience from working pppppppppp amp; leading various corporations and running his own consultancy practice, the book provides a detailed framework from which managers can follow to draw up their own plans. <sssss> On top of that, explainations are given throughout the book on why certains steps are needful while others are superfluous, what key issues to consider and what pitfalls to avoid in formulating the plan. <sssss> Three words that describe the content of the book will have to be: impactful, illuminating and practical. <sssss> A must-read for managers and aspiring MBAs in strategic management. <sssss> A second edition to bring in the role of IT in strategic planning would be great
Simon Cleveland "Author of 'The Basenji Revelation'"		The Judgment of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade That Gave the World Impressionism: Books: Ross King		2		If not, here is a chance to find out. <sssss> Two figures left an imprint on the French art amidst the turbulent times of the late nineteenth century. <sssss> Manet, whom history dubbed the father of Impressionism (although at the time art critics branded him untalented) and Meissonier, then the highest paid painters and now a figure obscured by history. <sssss> How did time turn the tables on these two characters? <sssss> Why is Meissonier forgotten, while the Manet's paintings sell with $20 million price tag? <sssss> The answer is in this book. <sssss> Mr. King's skillful examination of the art's progression from its realism to the appearance of impressionism in the latter part of 1800's makes for a delightful reading. <sssss> He analyzes the art critics of the time, the leading political figures, the consequences of a war with Prussia, the French life and French economy. <sssss> Written with intellectual appeal and with an eye on the events that drove history, The Judgment of Paris is highly recommend to all lovers of historical non-fiction. <sssss> -by Simon Cleveland
Jim Vadnais		Indestructible: The Unforgettable Story of a Marine Hero at the Battle of Iwo Jima: Books: Jack Lucas,D. K. Drum		1		A biography about a boy - and a very tough and brave one - who was in battle for such a short time he was spared the continuous horror that veteran survivors (or killed and maimed) of Iwo experienced. <sssss> He saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice. <sssss> By strict definition, this act was deserving of the Medal of Honor. <sssss> His terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching, but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of Iwo veterans, or any other battle, I have read. <sssss> The other accounts I have read generally conclude: War is a horrible thing to experience, and not glorious, but "I would do it again.........". <sssss> The recent books I have read will illustrate this contrast: "GOODBYE, DARKNESS", William Manchester "GOD IS NOT HERE.....", Richard Overton "THE QUIET HERO", Gary W. Toyn "FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS", James Bradley "THE LAST LIEUTENANT", John Shively These men may have entered combat as boys, but they certainly left as men.
BestWeddingSites.com "Editor"		The Art of the Table: A Complete Guide to Table Setting, Table Manners, and Tableware: Books: Suzanne Von Drachenfels		2		The Art of The Table - A Complete Guide to Table Setting, Table Manners, and Tableware, is extremely thorough in covering all the details related to proper table etiquette. <sssss> Author Suzanne Von Drachenfels makes it so easy, and entertaining in the process, finding the answer to any mealtime dilemma. <sssss> In nine, worldly-wise written chapters, you will learn all about table fundamentals. <sssss> Starting with the dining experience (formal vs. informal), then dinnerware, flatware, stemware, table linens, serving techniques, dining finesse, menu planning, Suzanne completes her mission with her undertaking of table manners in a changing world. <sssss> Her history lessons compliment any given subject and are very enjoyable. <sssss> Excellent
