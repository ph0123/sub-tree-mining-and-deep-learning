Not a good thing while drivin
i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book, the killer angels.
it is not fair to compare the two, but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one, i thought i should mention it.
this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book.
it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg, so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle.
but the result is a less satisfying book.
it skims rather than digs deep
This book is mostly hype.
The writing is not that great.
Japan must be really dying out if the country of some of the world's great literary giants can award such a prize for such weak work.
However the book has erotic energy and is fresh in that way.
If you are a serious reader skip this book.
For someone who spends his career attacking politically-motivated science, Stephen Jay Gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book.
Gould rambles on and on, attacking giants of modern science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton, and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own.
Gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class.
Gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct.
For anyone who has no knowledge of biology, this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science.
Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist; evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him, and it would be best if he, as well as all other crypto-Marxists who wish to blend science and politics, stay out of it
I am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book.
I guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans, but I just don't see what was great, or even good, about this story.
Two teenagers enter a school and end up killing seven people.
They are caught, they confess, and the Grandmother of one of the killers hires Spenser to prove the boy's innocense.
We are given the impression a great mystery, with possible red herrings, is about to entertain us.
Alas, it is not to be.
The kids did it, plain and simple.
Why they did it is so stupid.
The story reads as though a sixth grader has written it.
The plot is lame, and even as lame as it is, it isn't executed well at all.
The characters are boring and 2 dimensional.
The banter which takes place between the main character and others, while it seems to be trying to be witty, is just dumb and unbelievable.
I just can't say enough about how stupid this story is.
There are too many wonderful mystery authors out there writing gripping, intense works of fiction to waste your time on this one.
This is the first novel I have read by this author and will most definitely be my last
I bought this reluctantly because it was decided upon by a discussion group I was partipating in, but I ended up being very glad to have read this wonderful piece of contemporary literature.
Mary Lawson weaves an incredibly sad but totally compelling tale of life in a small community in Canada.
Others here have given insight into the plot and characters, so I'll keep this short by saying that you won't be disappointed and that I eagerly look forward to reading more from this author, she seems to have exceptional talent
this is most definitely my favorite book on earth!
i'm so serious, this is such a cool book.
it really appeals to anyone.
kids could read it because there are short sentances and pictures (some tough words though...start with epiplectic??)
but teens and adults (i'm sure) can also appreciate the morbid and brilliant humor of edward gorey.
for anyone that thinks that $10 is too much to spend on a little book, ((you may be right in some circumstances)) but this is such a fantastic book i know i am gushing but i love it soooooooo much!!
!
F this self-help industry crap.
Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst.
I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title.
Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them.
And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase.
Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you?
Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch.
That's a great start to a sane life
J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.
The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.
I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.
In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.
Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving.
Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.
This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.
A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.
A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.
Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.
Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.
The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.
The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.
As to the general plot of the book.
Poorly done.
Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.
Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.
My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.
A very disappointing book
in the possibility that Steve Berry could ever transcend his not-so great debut, The Amber Room.
Romanov Prophecy started in the right direction, Third Secret was OK, but I think he hit his *peak* right there.
I really want authors to get better--heck, I hope to write better papers as I go along in college.
But, Steve Berry, sorry.
And for all you people out there who don't like it when people give negative reviews of a book you like, just hang on a second before you give me a big fat NO vote.
First of all, even though this is fiction, the whole Da Vinci Code genre purports to be based on fact.
Berry always writes his Note at the end to underscore this.
However, if you want the reader to accept your plot, please get some basic facts correct first.
The most annoying one for me, as, ahem, a French major, is the very dramatic chapter closer where they zip off to the "Palais des Popes."
Excuse.
Me.
"Popes"?
Just because the English word looks kind of like the French word "pape" (for pope) doesn't mean you can flippantly swap them!
Eek.
And, btw, this is a real place, so some editor somewhere should have noticed this.
Shame on you, S.B.
's editors.
OK, I'm not saying a novel must contain no anachronisms whatsoever (it IS fiction, after all), but really big, glaring mistakes of geography or history cannot be tolerated.
The other main issue I have with this book is the vehement attack on Jesus Christ and the resurrection and the Bible as a whole.
Cotton Malone, our hero, says that the Bible contains hundreds (I'm paraphrasing) glaring inconsistencies.
If I remember correctly, he says that one of the gospels (he picks on Matthew a lot) doesn't place Bethlehem as the place of Jesus' birth.
That one doesn't hold water--I checked Matthew myself.
Says so in ch.
2.
I don't mean to thump the metaphorical Bible, but who is Steve Berry to question the authenticity of the world's #1 bestseller ever?
That's quite audacious ... some would even say blasphemous--but I tread on glass.
I really can't go into the terrible character development, or lack thereof, or the wussy Knights Templar.
Yeah, they're big and bad, but Malone seems to bump them off with the greatest of ease.
Some "Knights of Christ" they are.
Well, having alienated most of you, I bid you farewell as I go in search of a more worthy book
In light of Rev.
Falwell's unfortunate comments about the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001, I recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand, pppppppppp quot;Why would that guy say that stuff?
pppppppppp quot; Harding presents an objective, intelligent, perceptive analysis of the way that Fundamentalist language shapes the way in which they relate to the world, and how Jerry Falwell changed that shaping from withdrawal to the active Moral Majority of the 1980s.
Harding combs through Falwell's history and sermons to observe how the language of pppppppppp quot;being born again pppppppppp quot; affects the listener, showing Falwell's shift from separatism to political activism.
She critiques both Falwell and Falwell's critics in a fair and keenly insightful way.
Good reading and good understanding
While this book had some minor flaws (I'll discuss those briefly later), it is worth owning, especially since it is one of the few books to truly discuss the creative process of Cirque Du Soleil and how the rest of us can learn from what the performers do every day- the type of risks they take in hopes of creating magic, the beauty and spiritual resonance of their performances.
There is another book out there that explores one man's experiences with one performer and it is also intriquing but this new book reveals more about a wider variety of artists, directors, designers, etc.
And, for all those who've watched and been entranced by a Cirque du Soleil performance...wouldn't we all like to create a little of that magic in our lives?
Wouldn't we all like to ignite our own creative fires, even if they come out in different ways, perhaps in writing, perhaps in our work lives or the time we spend with our families or while alone.
One of the main lessons I got from this book is that being fully open as possible to one's imagination, hopes, dreams and aspirations can lead in wondrous directions and affect even the most "practical" or mundane tasks of life.
It just takes the willingness to take the risk, to accept failure and setbacks in return for spiritual and emotional growth and lifechanging experiences.
This is more than a book geared to artists and peformers.
It truly is for the rest of us.
It can change your life.
Having said that, I found myself wanting more, felt myself not quite fully satisfied by this book.
I felt some of the sections were a little too pat or formulaic.
But these are minor quibbles when the book offers so much and is one of the few books that really explores the Cirque du Soleil creative process.
Until a better one comes along, I'd consider this a MUST for anyone wanting to know more about the secrets and techniques of the Cirque du Soleil "spark", a spark that can affect us all.
Wow..I LOVE this book!
The recipes are creative and the presentations beautiful.
I love the simplicity of each recipe, which give the warmth and richness of traditional old fashioned taste with a twist of the class pppppppppp amp; sophistication of today's refined culinary experience!
Sara's food philosophy and the atmosphere she has created in her market has been my dream.
I'm living it through her cookbook right now
Classic book is great in dribble-proof format with good reproductions of the original illustrations.
Lots of squirming and hugging while reading this one
Its a good book to draw examples of idustries in different stages of technology evolution.
However it is lacking in theoretical content,
The trouble starts early.
There is an apologetic preamble which states that the author(s) would not dedicate precious space to titles that are well known and well documented beyond the gaming community.
This is an enormous assumption about the general public's knowledge - both of video games and more-so it's history of design.
Many people that have heard of these games or seen their children watch the TV-spinoffs, most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look(ed) like or anything about their play dynamics in a gaming environment.
Even though Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, Defender, Asteroids, Missile Command, Frogger, etc.
are mentioned briefly there are no images of reference for these classic games for us to (a) review and recognize, and (b) learn from.
If this is supposed to be a sort of retrospective of the graphic art of game design (this is not about studies of techniques for rendering) then why not show some of these all-time classics as well as the 'new-time' classics?
The latter are better represented throughout the book but some of the choices are omissions are questionable.
The brief smattering of 'classics' that are shown tend to be more human-looking figurative than 'iconic' which seems lacking to me in breadth and style of representation.
Beyond this much of the work - but not all - feels and looks rather 'same-y' to me.
Lots of brooding dark scene-scapes and characters clearly inspired by countless horror/goth/fantasy masters such as Boris Vallejo or much of the work seen in Heavy Metal.
When there is mention of games that are actually considered modern art on display at world-famous museums, such as "Rez," -- we are not shown any images of it because space was taken up by two nearly identical renderings of Lara Croft(!)
in the same spread.
One has to ask oneself: what was the author/picture editor thinking?
The fact of the matter is that for all the long-winded talk in the intro there is little to graphically show us where the industry came from verses where we are now.
And from what I can tell, there is absolutely no mention of the explosion of games and utterly unique designs being done in FLASH.
Arguably one of the largest and least expensive/complicated environments for making a unique game.
Furthermore, all the games covered and talked about (that I can tell) are from very large corporations and as such tend to be slanted and biased in a number of regards.
My biggest problem with this book was the editing - particularly with regard to choices of art.
Far too many examples if things that look the same versus examples of unique design concepts and forms as well as proper representations for an historical analysis.
Very nice printing, some nice layouts, and some interesting topics are raised with relation to character conception versus form, versus environment - but I would not recommend this for critical graphic design analysis or critical anything
Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life.
Well, I thought, next chapter will be better.
NOT.
The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels!
Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it!
If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book.
I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate.
Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload.
I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds....
I mean, does that seem like a lot to you???
For a light-hearted "tender" memoir????
Jeez louise!
I can't sleep at night from this book
Not insightful, not even humorous.
I am willing to admit that maybe I just don't get his writing style, whatever that might be.
I hope Mr. Rakoff gets into a new line of wor
As a recent grad of an org chem graduate program who had to suffer through the nearly 20 year old text "Mechanism and Theory in Organic Chemistry" by Lowry and Richardson, this book by Anslyn and Dougherty is a fabulous update that is easy to read and great asset to any chemistry student.
I agree with the other reviewers that the problem sets are challenging, the text is clearly written, and the material relates well back to current research issues.
If you are a graduate student considering getting another reference to help you through your organic chemistry graduate program, get this book before you try "Advanced Organic Chemistry: Structure and Mechanisms" by Carey and Sundberg.
I expect that "Modern Physcial Organic Chemistry" will become a staple to most chemist's shelves similar to that of a CRC Handbook or "Advanced Organic Chemistry" by March.
"Spring Snow" is unquestionably one of the finest Japanese novels ever written, as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right.
It is an eloquent, moving story with a "tale as old as time," that of star-crossed lovers who's love transcends social roles and obligations.
In another culture, with another writer, this would be a romantic, if not happy, story.
But this is Japan, and the writer is Mishima Yukio.
In his hands, the lovers Kiyoaki and Satoko transcend literary stereotypes, and become agents of their own happiness and destruction.
By the very nature of their relationship, raised together since childhood, playing a complicated cat-and-mouse game of love and sexual tension, their future is never in doubt.
It is impressive that a writer such as Mishima, known for his right-wing politics and his samurai dreams, could craft such a tender love story.
While knowing the eventual conclusion, the reader savors and hopes for each stolen moment of happiness between Kiyoaki and Satoko, and knows that even their despair is something to be treasured because it is shared.
Not that it is a clear path.
Even knowing Japanese literature, and the road it usually takes, there are surprises on the way.
Things do not turn out the way one would expect.
I was incredibly moved by "Spring Snow."
It is a novel that affects the heart of the reader, and lingers long after the last page is turned.
Dr. Rieux, the main character of the novel, moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner.
He goes thru the motions of "doing his job" while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague.
I find Jose Saramago's "Blindess" to be a far superior book to The Plague.
Similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving.
The Plague was clinical in its approach - almost bloodless.
I found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re-read, often having to re-read many pages over and over.
I would pass on this book
Well in my opinion, there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies, and some people have had some unusual experiences (mostly disturbing, but some apparrently enlightening), but the question is, is it all as it seems?
The fact of the matter is, various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us.
Holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys (this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events); there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario; advanced, drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now (Verichip).
I'm not saying that other lifeforms don't exist in the Universe (far from it), and perhaps there are a number of entities here on Earth carrying out agendas, but this idea that there are little, menacing Greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense COLLUSION seems suspect.
It smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us.
Historically, there's been the Barbarians, Huns, Mongols, Pagans, Jews, Christians, Vikings, black Natives, Cannabals, red Natives, Mexicans, Germans, Nazis, Communists, now the Arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on Earth.
Even President Reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80's.
The fact is that with known technology (not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked), they could quite easily pull the hoax off.
Even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and PRACTICED (albeit "underground") than most people can fathom.
What has become another fact is the major extent to which the UFO community has been infiltrated and compromised, of which Strieber has been front and centre at various times.
My belief is that Strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign, sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups.
In this book, his "hard-evidence" is flimsey and suspicious.
For example, why wouldn't super advanced Aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue (thus not showing up on any X-ray, MRI, CT, etc)?
And design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body?
Surely, this would be child's play for Alien scientists?
Why no major discussion or mention of the human military, or NAZI connection with abductions?
There seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange "fragments" of memories that are slipping through various memory covers.
Why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the Greys?
Why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms?
Why are some speaking English, others German?
Why is there a connection with deep, underground bases and specifically Antartica?
These are things Strieber never mentions, which I find curious.
My point is, things are happening, but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what, and Strieber's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas.
If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you.
This book has no insight on anything.
It is vague.
It doesnt explain anything in detail.
It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont.
Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes.
Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more!
You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor.
It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy
Briggs has perfected the art of the wordless book, and this is a great title to use to teach older kids how to do storyboarding for video or movie-making.
Compare the book to the video as a final "lesson" and students will see the intricacies of the craft.
This newly reissued edition has a "sparkly" cover, and is sure to be a favorite for families with kids of all ages, as well.
This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.
"True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.
There is no plot.
No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.
The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.
Wow, is this bad.
"Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.
You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed.
I was forced to read this book for my graduate studies and I found it surprisingly helpful.
By filling out a basic personality inventory, this book will tell you what pppppppppp quot;style pppppppppp quot; of worker you are and then how to deal with people of other pppppppppp quot;styles.
pppppppppp quot; I see this book being a hit with sales people who have to interact with many other people everyday.
But I can also see how this book could provide a foundation for learning how to work with other people in any environment.
If you are willing to make slight modifications to your personal behavior, this book gives you the skills to build great relationships.
I agree, however, with the previous reviewer's comments that this book does not go very deep, thus only 4 stars.
Do not expect to change your boss into a nice guy just by reading this, but you can make your day-to-day dealings with him more enjoyable using these tactics.

This is the real story about wall street firms and the way they look at their clients.
Beware that you may not like the way they look at you.
It is a good wake up call for those who think their broker is always looking out for their best interests.
Very entertaining with great stories.
You won't want to put it down!
I found Lovemaps a valueable and insightful look at the way individuals relate to sexual behavior and establish their sexual identify and desires based on life experiences which as Dr. Money indicates occurs in childhood and which is unconsciously formed by the individual.
I found this book extremely helpful while working on my Doctorate in Human Sexuality and now 6 years later as I continue my research and work as a Sexologist and Sex Therapist.
I highly recommend this book to other Sexologist and Clinicians, as well as any man or woman who is interested in learning more about sex and sexual behavior; and in essence more about themselves.
It definitely helps if you read a book before judging it.
And this book should be in everyone's "Sensual Library".

Like so many of the books in the for dummies series it is well written and just gets down to business.
The approach taken with this book is a nonviolent approach to training with training being enjoyed by both man (or woman) and beast.
I have been training my Shiba Inu puppy based on this book for the last two months now and have had good results.
This book offers such a fabulous collection of ideas.
The information and ideas one can gather from these pages is both a great way to trace the roots of feminism as well as to decide where we go from here.
Each section and piece has introductory information giving a setting of time, place and situation before the writers present their views.
There are so many ideas, ideals and beliefs that while not always agreeable or congruent, can be applied to today's feminist movement.
There is virtually nothing in the book that isn't valuable as either an example of progress or the seed of a new branch for the feminist tree.
To understand the position in which women today navigate life, this book is essential reading.
Interesting, entertaining and informative, it ought to be required readin
I am a big Tananarive Due fan because she never fails to deliver the goods in terms of interesting plot, storyline and characters, which many can be anyone of us.
She is a fascinating author as she creates several different scenarios that are very different over a great span of time and unites them in a way that is nothing short of amazing.
Keep up the good work.....A T. Due fan!
Trinice S. Moses - Sisters with a Purpose Book Clu
This is a revolutionary book.
It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage.
It's questionable how novel this metaphor is, but this is certianly its first explicit statement.
The language used to present the ideas of the author is, like most sociological writing, unecessarily complicated.
There are some problems with clarity and structure; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me.
No sociological background is presupposed, there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources, many footnotes, and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book.
So if you are interested in reading sociology, this is probably a good place to start (again, the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it's bane as an introduction).
However, the book is misguided.
The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary.
The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer.
(The following is a charicature of the author's argument).
There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people (the audience) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor.
Well, if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations, infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage, "All the world is not, of course, a stage, but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify" (p 72).
The performances can either be with individuals, or groups of people, and they can be performing conciously or unconciously.
(end of charicature) There are other arguments, obviously, and the statement "we can draw a parallel with other situations" is most of the content of the book, which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence.
But the real question here is, is the view worthwhile?
My answer: No.
Social interaction is a complex phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor.
Yes, some social interaction is like a performance, where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another.
Yes, some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs.
However, most social interaction is exactly the way we see it, conciously controlled, meaningful, purposeful interaction with individuals; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a "reality".
I hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out: the book is a waste of time.
Where the author is right, the statement is little more than common sense.
Where the author goes outside of common sense, he's wrong, sometimes plainly so.
This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes, that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control (here the wool is the performance, and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions).
There is no real empirical support given for most of the claims.
Where "evidence" is given, the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter.
Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth.
Various sources of sociology are cited, but this is more like intellectual bullying.
Saying that some author, which also didnt have any empirical support for his claims, agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims.
The claims in the book have no practical application in the world, but only serve to intepret situations differently, and in personal opinion, less correctly.
Nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology.
In short, this isnt a scientific study at all.
My final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph, the use of language.
The best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction "A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants" (15).
This is a curios definition.
Me breathing while i work is a performance, it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers.
Me staring into space is a performance, other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced.
Infact, me simply existing is a performance, since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants, as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing.
Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person, and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance.
He didnt.
He used a word that we associate with controlled behavior (performance) and defined it in a way no one is used to.
Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance, its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality.
I hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to Goffman and sociology more generally.
So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt.
Why wont this subject go away?
This book is an integral part of sociology, and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition.
The methods are questionable; the style is obscure.
Like it or hate it, sociology is a part of modern thought.
Read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings
This isn't really a novel and it isn't really a collection of short stories, but the vignettes are more fable than whimsy because fables are filled with lessons.
Alan Lightman writes about many possibilities of the alternate reality of time, as he imagines Einstein envisioned them.
Each alternate reality builds off a cliched phrase we use to describe time: Time is Money, Time Flows Uphill, Live in the Present - Forget the Past, Time is Motion, etc.
Lightman writes beautifully and his imagined realities are intriguing, each could be the setting for powerful stories.
It's a quick read, a fun read, and well worth the 'time.'

I really liked this one because of the characters... and of course the background being about wine.. and the lifestyle of those who create it :) I definitely recommend this one.
This book is so outdated.
All the techniques listed in this book are from the 1980's and earlier, which means that most of the things you can learn from this book are already learned by you from the past.
There are much more recent interesting researches and discoveries of human nature you can find in other books
I agree with the reviews already written.
I too got bogged down with trying to keep track of the names.
It is when I got to the end I found the listing of the people.
If I had known that earlier it would have reduced my mind confusion.
Really enjoyed the way the book was written.
You felt their pain with out seeing their blood.
I better understand the explosion
This play was amazing!
I am not a reader, and I couldn't put it down.
I recommend this play for any actor.
It will stretch your mind and acting abilities.
I consider myself knowledgeable about history, especially WW2.
After reading just half of "Flags of our Fathers'" I realize how much I 'didn't' know about this part of the war.
Most of my research was of the european theatre.
I am so glad I purchased this book.
It makes me feel so humble as to my own time spent in uniform for I never had to endure or sacrifice what these young men did.
Anyone thinking of not voting should read this and be sure to vote for these young men gave everything so that we could have that right.
Even more they went through hell before they did it.
Do yourself a favor and get this book.
Richard Neal Huffman - Author of Dreams In Blue: The Real Polic
Finally there is a solution to the problem of world poverty!
Yunnus has proven, by the success of his bank's loans to the desperately poor, that the poor are masters of survival and the best equipped to pull themselves out of poverty given the right tools and support.
Founder of the Grameen Bank, he and his collaborators in many coutries throughout the world (including the US and Canada) have shown that lending to the poor, helping them realize their own potential and giving them the support network they need to succeed is having dramatic results wherever it is tried.
Yunnus' book is inspiring and an eye-opener.
It made me realize that professionals working in large international charity organizations cannot bring about genuine change unless their offices and employees live and work among the people they are trying to help.
It's hard to separate the book from the idea.
One is as fascinating as the other.
Out of 5 points, I give it a six
I have nothing more to say than I've already said in my headline.
Lou Dobbs' book was a big disappointment for me.
I am from Romania and the book arrived in about 2 weeks.
I am very pleased of it, it has no damages, it arrived quickly and, most important, it's a very good book.
A touching story that will make you laugh and cry.
I recommend it
Wendell Jaffe swindled a lot of people out of money and then conveniently disappeared from his boat.
The verdict was suicide, but the insurance company that had sold him a half-million dollar insurance policy is not convinced.
When 5 years passed, the company was forced to pay the premium to Jaffe's wife.
Two months later, a man looking very much like Jaffe is spotted in Mexico.
The insurance company hires private investigator Kinsey Millhone to investigate and she does spot a man who appears to be Jaffe, along with his girlfriend Renata.
They escape Kinsey's surveillance and she returns to California.
Jaffe's son Brian is in big trouble with the police and Kinsey concludes that Jaffe will return to help his son.
As she continues her investigation she becomes acquainted with Jaffe's supposed widow and his two troubled sons.
She also comes in contact with some of her long-lost family, and agonizes over whether she wants to establish a relationship with them, and open up old wounds.
Sue Grafton can be relied on to provide a good read, and this book, although not the best in the series, is no exception
The Reviewers above and below warn that the novel is difficult to read.
If you a person of average intelligence, all you need is a character list and a careful reading and you will have absolutely no problem finding your way through the greatest novel ever written.
(It's an incredibly easy read the second time around.)
The Sound and the Fury is a summation of Faulkner's works.
Everything that is done in the rest of his novels was first done in The Sound and the Fury.
The Sound and the Fury is poignant and tragic.
It is monumental in its mythical power.
It is Southern and yet it is universal.
It is Faulkner's triumph as a novelist.
It is a study of human consciousness, perception, and existence.
The novel follows the decline and eventual fall of the Compson family.
In Faulkner's world of Yoknapatawpha County, the Compsons and Sartorises, the Sutpens and de Spains, in other words, the established old families of Jefferson declined as the invasive and unethical Snopes, portraits of the modern businessman, ascended to power.
The story is an intimate portrayal of the Compsons, and yet it is a symbolic and mythical account of decline and tragedy.
Why is it the greatest novel ever written?
It takes the innovations in narrative technique as developed by Joyce and Woolf in the movements of European Modernism (which it does better and with more purpose than Joyce and Woolf) and combines them with an exploration of storytelling and an intense devotion to a portrayal of place and region.
The story is great and moving.
The characters are loveable, hateable, tragic, and intensely vivid.
The place is conceived and presented with taxing reality.
The language, as with all of Faulkner's novels, is at times soaring and at times quite terse.
The structure is perfectly balanced and symbolically paired with the passion of Christ (the three days are Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday).
In short, it is the paradigmatic example of what literature can (and should) do; even the greatest of literary feats stand in its shadow
One of the best new authors to date, and possibly one of the best writers in the history of the English language!
Jasper has a VERY firm grasp of the language and creates a..slightly...twisted version of reality where people jump into books, fictional characters jaunt around the real world (Hamlet) and books have a tendancy to re-write themselves.
Characters include Jane Eyre (of course), the Cheshire cat, The Red Queen, Hamlet, and a slew of minor personalities from books out of print (for good reasons).
If you like puns, you'll LOVE this series
I purchased this book to gain a better insight about Aspergers.
Instead, it left me with many unanswered questions.
The book is the equivalent to a boring, monotonous `Dear Diary' that gets stuck in one era: His college years and his interest in music.
(This is understandable as the author is terrified of life outside of college, pppppppppp music is all he knows.)
Yet I craved more details, I wanted to know more about Mr. Shores' childhood, his parents, the stims, and the chaos...DETAILS!
It felt as if the author was trying to prove how intelligent he is, boasting of his accomplishments and how he's almost neurotypical.
His failures were blamed on other people out to get him for unknown reasons.
Lets say it for what it is: A man who looks kind of disheveled and a bit `odd' (Unabomber) gets a job in a financial institution, he rides his bike in, hangs out in the shadows getting dressed, doesn't socialize - and no one wants him around.
It's BECAUSE HE'S WEIRD!
Yet the author blames his co-workers.
I'm sorry but the reality is, the author probably can't see and understand that he IS different because he has Aspergers!
I mean, most typical people can spot someone that is odd/weird/different a mile away.
They avoid them not because they're being hurtful, they just can't relate to that person.
I wished he had focused in much greater detail about his feelings, emotions and behaviors when he was younger-to gain a better understanding of what shaped him into the person he is now.
The book was written as if he fast-forwarded through his entire youth and got stuck on `pause' when he got to college.
While this is obsessively interesting to him, it was tiring reading page after page of redundant accounts of his college days.
There is no depth to the book, it was shallowly written and there is not enough elaboration to make me understand, (or want to for that part) what makes Stephen Shore the person he is.
While this may be due in part to his disorder, it left so much to be desired.
I'm sorry to anyone who takes offense to this review, as this is not my intention.
I applaud Mr. Shores accomplishments and the hurtles he's overcome.
He must be MUCH more dimensional than the book conveys.
I wanted to know more about HIM and not what he's done in his life.
I'd suggest a better read would be one of Temple Grandin's books.
I got a true feeling of who she is and an understanding of how she got there and how autism fits in.
She goes into details about what she was thinking as a girl, teenager and adult.
Her pranks, her temper, the metaphors and their importance..everything.
I bought this book based on reviews, and I felt it necessary to give mine.
Dr. Freeman's justly esteemed "Lee's Lieutenants" -- a THREE VOLUME work -- still stands (despite the discovery of materials unavailable to Dr. Freeman when he first wrote in the 1930s and 40s) as the baseline for any study of the Army of Northern Virginia.
The cheap attempt by a modern publisher to squeeze a few cents out of the franchise, offered here, throws out TWO of every THREE words Dr. Freeman wrote to allow for a one-volume "abridgement" for those presumably too intimidated by the thought of reading three entire books.
The three-volume work, as Dr. Freeman wrote it, was reprinted fairly recently.
If that is no longer available on Amazon, any decent sized used book store will have it in stock.
WHATEVER you do, avoid this butchered, one volume version like the plague
Who better to write a book about morons than Flynn?
An abyssmally miserable book with so little substance I was surprised it didn't float out of my hands.
It's a great resource for those looking for a plethora of examples of pitifully poor logic; Two wrongs don't make a right, non-sequiturs galore, red herrings - they're all there.
It seems apparent the goal was to scoop up the easy money from the thin thinkers in our world.
It certainly wasn't to write a scholarly treatise where the reader came away enlightened in the slightest way.
I guess I have fallen into the category of "moron" by spending money on it and worse yet, reading it to completion.
I'm embarrassed.
Flynn should be too
This is like teen-love-fiction, and by that I mean it's like a teenager wrote it, one who uses bad detail, cliche phrases, overused idioms, bad dialogue and poorly crafted plot.
Meet mr. millionaire who teaches polo to a woman -- and they of course fall in love, slowly, boringly, painfully.
Then the kids come in and the remainder of the book is like a couple dealing with kids, with no plot development.
Yuck.
She says on the back she's responding to a call for something like energy and thrills and sexy writing.
Uh, not in this one.
The only sexy scene is on page 138, and that's not very good either.
The best part of the book is that it proves she really does need to go back and learn the craft of writing because either she never learned it or she forgot what she learned
This book is highly informative, updated to include everything up to around Hero's Trial (New Jedi Order), which makes it a must even if you already have the more presentable Star Wars Encyclopedia.
While the Encyclopedia has more interesting and fact filled entrys, it's also hideousely out of date, a problem that this one would easily correct!
I read it cover to cover in a few days, and was quite impressed with how much research went into it, and how few errors were made.
Even so, I have to say I'd recommend this book mainly to fans experienced with EU stuff, lest they quickly become lost and overwhelmed
First off, I have to admit: I am 22 years old and read the entirety of this book in one 7 hour sitting on my way to Paris.
I picked up the novel out of sheer curiosity and personal research for my job.
I work at Barnes pppppppppp Noble and am in charge of both the Teen and Children's sections.
When our store sold out of New Moon within a week of initially getting the book, my curiosity was piqued -- I felt I had to give its predecessor a try so I knew what the hype was about and could give an honest opinion about the book.
Now here I sit and I have finished both Twilight and New Moon.
I have to admit -- Meyer has a talent.
Both books I read at breakneck speed, barely stopping to eat or sleep.
Her prose is smooth and easy, accompanied by a plot that I found engrossing.
I went back after reading Twilight and re-read my favorite sections more than once.
The love story was hypnotizing and surprisingly seductive.
I definitely plan on recommend this book, mainly to teenage girls who will swoon over Edward.
However, I only gave the book four stars.
While I enjoyed it immensley as I read the novel, a few things bothered me upon looking back: 1) While Meyer deinitely has a talent for writing an engaging novel full of beautiful descriptions, the character descriptions at times felt extremely lazy.
If I had to read one more time about Edward's marble, angelic face (what, exactly, does that mean??
), his liquid topaz eyes, or how Bella glared at Edward, I thought I was going to pitch the book down the aisle of the plane.
2) I'm not sure I buy their romance.
It was heartstopping and climactic during the read, but honestly, what DOES he see in her?
If Bella keeps asking that question to herself, maybe her audience shoud seriously consider it.
3)Bella herself bothered me.
I found Bella to be horribly dependent on Edward to the point that I got irritated with her.
And her constantly having to catch her breath around Edward -- Puh-leeze.
Be a woman!
Stand on your own feet!
She never fully developed into a character for me since she revolved solely around Edward, something that I, as a self-sustained woman, cannot connect with.
And lastly, 4)Bella wants so desperately to become a vampire, but that seems like it could pose a problem between herself and Edward.
Since I haven't seen any evidence that Edward likes Bella for any other reason than that she smells wonderful (a scent that she has because she is human and has blood coursing through her veins, mind you), what happens when she no longer smells good?
Meyer is really going to have to prove to me that Edward actually loves Bella for other reasons than her smell, otherwise it will be completely unbelievable if Bella turns into a vampire and Edward is still attracted to this ordinary girl...
Although the plot has its shortcomings, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and that is why I give it four stars.
I will read the next one when it comes out, and any other subsequent after that, for the simple reason that the books are entertaining and Edward is so dang alluring
.... you can get all three of these wacky books in one neat volume!
Doesn't this hurt the bottom line at Hagee Ministries?
What, has the pool of his mesmerized followers begun to dry up?
It reminds me of when the band, KISS (aka Kings In Satan's Service) re-packaged their first three albums as "The Originals."
At least in that case you had an extra track of "Rock and Roll All Nite", assuming you already had the album "Dressed To Kill."
On the other hand, maybe Hagee Ministries was using the KISS model, assuming that it wouldn't hurt to have his drivel repeated in one handy, compact volume of fear
Toward the end of How Now Shall We Live, Chuck Colson states, regarding popular music and media, that a little cotton candy is permissible as part of a healthy diet.
However, he warns, a diet of junk food can be fatal.
Good advice concerning pop culture-but even more applicable to this book.
Yes, it contains a kernel of truth, but it ultimately is dangerous if not balanced by a heavy diet of other thinkers and theologians such as Thomas Merton, St. Francis of Assisi, Ron Sider, Tony Campolo, Brian McLaren, Brother Lawrence, Philip Yancey, Wendell Berry-the list goes on.
It often is guilty of oversimplifying the ideological conflicts the modern Church faces, drawing the lines down to "Christians" against the "naturalists" or "humanists," thus ignoring the wide range of threats that seek to destroy the Church.
While there is truth in Colson's writing, I believe it ultimately stems from a flawed worldview-one defined largely by comfortable middle-class American thought and militaristic nationalism, sprinkled with the politically correct amount of Christian belief.
His faith seems to be overly academic, one that favors rhetoric and proof over prayer and other spiritual disciplines.
Evangelism, it seems to Colson, is comprised heavily of apologetics.
The secularists must be shown that they are wrong, he says.
Yes, there is truth and there is time for debate, but this book seems to prefer winning debates over building bridges and relationships.
You see, I used to fear evolutionists and the proverbial round table of "secular humanists" that many conservative evangelicals love to discuss.
But as I've grown, I realize that threats to the Church come more often from within than from secular culture, and they almost always have more to do with power and politics than the Enlightenment or science.
Mr Wong is making a good living selling his book and working the lecture circut.
Some good ideas but a lot of impractical stuff included.
The reality of the classroom and the ineffectiveness of school administration make working under such ideal circumstances unrealistic.
Work in 5 classes of 40-50 kids each day who can't read (many are moved up so they can be with their friends) and such touchy feely programs quickly fall aside.
Geez.
Its a book folks.
Nobody said it was going to be perfect.
Granted the sentence structure leaves alot to be deisred but use your imagination.
Draw upon your inner child and immerse yourself in the story and stop worrying about the piddly things.
If you want to read books then read them and enjoy them.
If you want to EDIT them then go be an editor.
We live in a world where people sell drugs that kill our kids for money and your worried about this guy making a few bucks with a writing career?
It's called priorities people, get some.
I say he should continue to write and see what he becomes.
I have read Tolkien (not just The Hobbit and LOTR - but ALL of his works).
Dark Tower, Harry Potter, and Star Wars stuff too.
I love Sci-Fi.
Stop nitpicking.
If your at that point then you have lost the purpose of picking up a good sci-fi book.
Start over.
Do not pass go and do not collect $200.00.
I liked the book except the ending,I do not think she should have taken Sam back,He did not stand by her when she needed her most instead he went after another woman,The things he said and did to Alex were unforgivable,Sorry doesn't cut it.
When our book club selected this novel, I was enthusiastic ~ the premise appeared to leave so much room for the development of great characters and a great story.
However, after the first chapter or so, I kept waiting for the big "wow" factor...and it never came.
I found most of the characters unsympathetic and not very well-developed.
Like other readers, I finished it out of obligation, but never gleaned any enjoyment from reading it.
These are revised remarks since my comments about "Prediabetes" and "Stop Diabetes" being the same book.
I got them both and felt somewhat duped.
Gretchen did contact me to explain the Prediabetes is a second edition of Stop Diabetes.
I wish it said that on the cover.
The book(s) info about stopping the progression of diabetes is great, so I do recommend either of these books.
It is well written in a style that's easy to understand.
Just don't get both books; they're essentially identical
Imaginary playmates are not unusual.
But, there hasn't been a playmate like TillyTilly since those nasties Henry James created in "Turn of the Screw."
And, like them, TillyTilly seems to be something more than what a child has imagined.
Jessamy Harrison, the eight-year-old daughter of a Nigerian mother and a British father, is a precocious and lonely child subject to screaming tantrums and panic attacks.
During a visit to her Nigerian relatives, Jess explores an abandoned building and meets TillyTilly, a child of her own age, who she befriends.
The problem is, no one else can see TillyTilly.
On their return to England, TillyTilly mysteriously shows up and soon leads Jess into a heap of trouble.
Fun becomes horror as Tilly demonstrates a penchant for cruelty.
Given that Miss Oyeyemi was only 18 when she penned this complex novel, there are some drawbacks.
Jess is often portrayed as much more sophisticated and articulate than the reader can believe and some characters are not drawn out enough.
Despite these flaws, maturity is certain to give us a writer well worth watching for in the future.
I "religiously" read all of Baldacci's books - he can't write them fast enough for me; and this is one of his best!
I'd give it 10 stars if I could
I found stale recounting of very well-known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics, with no insights.
Since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors, and it's only 200 pages in a fairly large typeface, I wasn't expecting historical depth.
But I was expecting at least one fresh idea.
I bought it on the strength of a much earlier book by Nathan Rosenberg (about technology in the economy of the 19th century).
I was disappointed.
I get the feeling the book is intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower -- college freshmen born in the 1980s.
I'll bet they find it kinda stodgy
I have a book of Ross' by the same title, but the cover is different (remake?)
but most of my problems with his theology come from his advocation of the "big bang theory" which has numerous scientific problems (quantized redshifts to name one) and serious theological implications.
If the big bang were true, then there were animals before man.
Animals that lived and died.
The Bible says that man's sin is the reason why we die and suffer.
If death was around before sin ("For the wages of sin is death") then what good would Jesus' death on the cross have been
If you are a gourmet chef this book may be far too basic for you but it is great for a beginner like me.
I have two kids under the age of two and have been able to cook a decent meal from this cookbook every night for the past month that I have owned it.
My husband has been very impressed with my new found cooking abilities and all but one of the meals I have fixed has been good.
I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost faith that they can ever cook well
I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.
Not one of my better decisions.
Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."
We are talking zero development of characters.
Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.
Well, he's wrong.
You basically just don't care about these people.
They aren't real, and they talk weird.
Not much action either, unless you count actions like: they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.
You get the picture.
This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.
Don't fall into his trap like I did.
There are a lot better books out there.
The book claims to help you: 1.
Say goodbye to aching joints, sagging skin and fatigue 2.
Improve the quality and function of the genetic material in your cells 3.
Ramp up your body's self-repair functions 4.
Increase your stamina, endurance and sex drive 5.
Dramatically improve your resistance to disease, including cancers 6.
Have more youthful, radiant skin You don't need to be a cynic to be able to tell that the claims are all inflated.
Sure, you'll see some improvement if you have been leading a very unhealthy lifestyle, but for those of us who are already exercising regularly and eating a relatively healthy diet, some of the tips on progressing further to "genetic repair" will sound a bit too good to be true.
In fact, most of the advice and recommendations given in the book are not very different from that found in many other books on nutrition and supplement.
The authors just gave all the info a "DNA twist".
I stopped reading the book a few chapters from the end when it begins to talk about hormonal supplementation and some glowing testimonial on the author's services.
All "natural"?
No side effects?
How long have the subjects been followed up and how long have physicians really practised hormonal therapy on otherwise healthy individuals?
The results may be real, but how safe is it for the rest of subject's life?
Sounds like another one of those practice-promoting books in this genre.
Disappointing
I was not expecting this book to be a Sunday afternoon photo shoot for reanactors.
It lacks reality and substance.I returned this book out of disapointment.Seeing the same faces in every picture but in diffrent uniforms takes a lot away from this book.
However, the color photos were nice.
Better luck next time but a A for effort
This was a comprehensive collection of statistics and War Department strategy notes but it had no life.
It gave no feel for the soldier, sailor or marine on the ground.
It was all acronyms and big picture strategy.
If you are looking for something less academic and more readable try a different account of the battle.
Since this was one of the most gruelling and bloody encounters of the war, the participants should get more ink.
Here, the brass get all the attention
This second edition of a classic provides an update on a reference recommended for college-level collections specializing in Chinese literature.
Sources of Chinese Tradition has been recognized already as a scholarly staple: in its new form Sources of Chinese Tradition has been extended to include the Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin eras of China and includes invaluable source readings on history and literature of the times, from the 18th-century Qing civilization onward
Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian.
This book is awful.
The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry.
There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books.
I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot.
This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it.
If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember.
If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does.
The material is first-rate but his writing style is horrid.
His five-part typology of memory doesn't make sense since he is basically repeating the same theme for each type of memory in each chapter.
The underlying theme is about the destruction and shattering of the self.
Very poorly written and bad organizatino of his material.
There are much better and clearer books on the Holocaust!
Don't bother with this one
I have read almost all of Greg Bear's books and loved EON and ETERNITY as well as THE FORGE OF GOD and ANVIL OF STARS.
I found LEGACY a little disappointing compared to EON and ETERNITY, which preceded them.
The narrative spends a lot of time on the human interactions of the characters, and not much time on the technological concepts of the flaw and gate openers, which I missed.
I did finish this book and at times was quite spellbound by it.
Not Mr. Bear's best work, but a must-read if you have read EON and ETERNITY
You know that guy down the street who acts awful snake-like?
What about the cashier at Walmart who is catty?
And there are always people in our lives that could easily be one of many species of monkeys.
Neil Gaiman shows through fiction that there may be more to these strange characters in our lives than we realize.
In this novel, gods (which represent animals) roam the earth in the bodies of humans.
The main character is the clever, trouble-loving spider who interacts with other animal-gods in everyday human life.
This book, along with other science fiction books, has given me an appreciation of the creativity of the human imagination.
The strong point of this novel is the humor employed by Neil Gaiman.
On par with Douglas Adams, the author of Anasi Boys fills the pages with quirky, pop-culture laden humor.
The main character, Fat Charlie, I found much in common with.
His awkward moments with friends, family and everyone else reveal a social insecurity that many are familiar with.
The story, however, isn't anything special.
I like witches and animal-gods as much as the next guy, but the plot is uninteresting.
It is a rare book that combines wit with plot, and this is not one of those rare books.
The Andromeda Strain tells the story of a bacteria growth in Piedmont, Arizona.
This bacteria kills people in a matter of seconds and killed everyone in the town except for a 69 year old man and a baby.
A top secret commission is formed to see how these bacteria kill people and to see how they can be stopped.
This book has the makings of a real thriller.
I couldn't put the book down through the first 250 pages.
However, this book had a dissipointing ending.
This book involves a lot of "cool" technology.
This book could have taken place today (instead of 1969) because I could visualize a lot of the book.
I found myself thinking "Awesome technology" more then I was thinking that Crichton is sure a great author.
He seemed to involve a little too much foreshadowing.
This book does involve a lot of research and "up-to-date theories" for 1969, but is a little dated today.
This does not take anything out of the story.
I would recommend this book because it is really interesting.
Lots of research went into this book.
The book is fast paced and has many modern aspects of a Crichton novel
I've been reading a chapter a day for over a yr.
It's a great motivator for the day ahead.
I've found this translation to be the best I've read.
Other translations have been boring or too dense.
This one was very powerful
I bought this book along with Saving Dinner and Saving Dinner for the Holidays last year.
I LOVE the concept of having the weekly menu planned out as well as the grocery list put together and ready for shopping.
We went through the entire book and I have to say, it really broadened our food horizons as we had been stuck in a rut for a long time with our regular foods.
Also, the books really did eliminate a lot of stress by allowing me to know in advance "What's for dinner" and be ready to prepare it.
The only cons I can think of would be that the food is not exactly kid friendly, and you will need to be an open minded eater.
If you have a lot of people with finicky preferences in your household, this may not be the book for you.
Also, our grocery bill for two went up from about $75 a week to $125 because of the veggies and meats.
Good, healthy quality food ingredients, but unfortunately, painful to the wallet.
That said, I have NEVER seen a low carb book out there that compares to this one, the food is good, the variety is there, and it takes the low carb lifestyle above and beyond "bunless burgers" and eggs and bacon.
Overall, I would recommend Leanne's Saving Dinner books.
For the open minded foodie.
Or for those weeks that you just want to not worry about dinner and the grocery list.
These books are great to have and do offer a good variety of recipes to broaden horizons while removing some stress
Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf."
When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with.
What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption.
The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose.
We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus.
From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works.
Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.
The big story is, alas, not so impressive.
It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens.
Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die.
In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.
The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is.
He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end.
Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught.
And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night.
When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess?
Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild?
Does anyone really care?
I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't.
Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects.
And what a bore that became.
There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write.
If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics.
If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone.
Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting
I like most of Jack Kornfield's work and this book is no exception.
It has a lot of good stories that are very entertaining and each of them illuminates important spiritual truths.
The focus of this book is on misconceptions about enlightenment and samdhi experiences.
Also, it contains some beautiful accounts of samdhi experiences taken from various religious traditions.
There is a lot of practical wisdom in this book about finding meaning on the spiritual path and in life in general.
Jack Kornfield dispels the illusion we are ever a finished product or that our various personality quirks will ever disappear completely.
In one section, he quotes Ram Dass who once was asked, did you get rid of all your personality problems and he replied, "no.. but I've become a connoisseur of my neurosis."
In another section, Jack talks about vocation or purpose in life.
I found this to be particularly well done and personally meaningful.
While the book is good, I think you may get more out of the audio CD because you get to hear the tone of his voice and inflections.
I think this carries a part of the communication that doesn't come across in his books.
My favorite taped work by Jack Kornfield is your Buddha Nature.
This is on the 10 paramitas (perfections) and I think it represents his most poignant expression of his thinking on life.
If you like After the Ecstasy, the Laundry... you may want to consider purchasing this as well
Sheer and utter.
This hardly can be called a work of fiction.
Had this been his first work, I could understand the grammatical mistakes, but this is inexcuseable.

Robert Kiyosaki's books are all the same thing re-packaged over and over again.
This book could have been condensed into a couple of paragraphs and saved it's readers a lot of time.
He writes in an arrogant, condescending manner that is hard to stomach.
I would hate to have been his real dad.
It's obvious that he despises him and worships at the alter of "Rich Dad."
It's offensive and disturbing.
Read the first review of this book and you'll have the essence of the whole thing.
Don't give this guy any more money for putting out this drivel
Woodward and Bernstein, famous reporters for the Washington Post during the Watergate scandal, chronicle their experience investigating and exposing the deceptive actions of President Nixon and his cronies during Watergate.
This book takes the reader through Woodward and Bernstein's efforts at uncovering the truth, internal dilemmas about the information they were uncovering, and covert meetings with confidential sources.
They tell a tale of mystery and intrigue that stands up to some of the world's best fiction except that this story actually happened and signaled the end of an era where the US Presidency was respected above all else.
This book is a fascinating look at how investigative journalism once was.
Instead of printing first and asking questions later, Woodward and Bernstein, along with their editors, took painstaking efforts at checking, double checking, and even triple checking their sources and information before putting something derogatory in print.
It seems a sharp contrast to journalism today that appears to be publish now, ask questions later, and file a retraction in small print even later.
This book also tells the tale of two very opposite reporters and how they pulled together to write about the crime spree of the century and topple a corrupt Presidency.
It gets better with each reading
If an author sets out to write a collection of short stories about adultery, you'd think they'd have a lo say about it, right?
Well, Ford certainly expends plenty of words, but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel-gazing group of stories.
Mind-numbingly similar in tone and temperament, the ten stories center of upper and upper-middle class white, middle-aged, married professionals who seem to have drifted into infidelity.
Story after story plods cautiously along, poking at the consequences of adultery in a very mild way, with leaden dialogue and a lot of empty moodiness.
Adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite-of-passage for a disconnected male.
Marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons, and yet Ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it.
I have no idea what his personal background or situation is, but it's a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something.
If he wasn't such a literary bigshot, there's no way this would have been published-it strikes the same note over and over and over, and isn't provocative, insightful, or even interesting.
PS.
If you were planning on the audio version, don't.
Ford is a terrible reader, sounding like someone reading the telephone book aloud as punishment
Cahill's writing is somewhat of an acquired taste.
This is a compilation of outdoor stories which do not always seem self contained - some missing context, some missing closure.
And they are not necessarily adventures in the conventional sense, as stories may focus on nature, archaeology, sociology, etc.
While the book cannot be construed as an outdoor reference, there is good information (ex.
pppppppppp quot;wisdom pppppppppp quot; of cave diving).
Some stories hit the vicarious adventurer's sweet spot.
The author is at his best in this book when relating his experience caving in Kentucky, engaging the reader with educational content (ex.
barometric effect on air flow), spectacular descriptions(ex.
lightening igniting bat guano), and hair raising suspense (ex.
getting lost in a maze of passages).
Not all of the stories held an equal level of interest for me, but they are short enough to peruse and ponder as time permits
Hateful liberals once again undermine their so-called ideology by promoting the hatred of over half the US population.
They claim to be tolerant and open-minded toward all lifestyles,religions, races etc... but that open-mindedness obviously shouldn't apply to people who disagree with them.
Throughout the "book," Moore also demonstrates his racism towards caucasians and thin people.
If you like this book, I also recommend Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler.
Both "books" are jam-packed full of hate.

John Tyree is a soldier first, a man second.
Or so he thinks until he meets Savannah Lynn Curtis.
While on leave, he falls desperately in love with Savannah, the proverbial girl of his dreams.
Sweet, intelligent, and giving, John knows he'll always carry her torch.
When September 11 changes the world, John is no exception.
Moved by patriotic loyalty, he chooses to "re-up" in the army, adding time to his service and breaking his promise to return to Savannah.
More promises are broken when he must attending to his ailing father.
This is the story of how an ideal love can falter, despite its purity and strength.
Not every romance results in a happy ending, but with a great deal of luck, those who don't survive will find meaning from the experience.
Love, loyalty, friendship--all those sentiments are great, but to what cost?
And how does this make a good man great?
This is John's journey to that understanding.
It goes without saying that Nicholas Sparks is one of today's "master" storytellers.
Part of what makes him so successful is that he has the ability to create moving stories without pulling punches or painful twists.
Such is the case in DEAR JOHN.
Sparks offers a love story that has all the requisite components--well-crafted setting, high emotion, obstacles, resolution--then breaks it.
It is from the sadness that hope emerges, and John Tyree, although still quite young, gains wisdom that will last a lifetime.
Sorrow will be a large part of this, yes, but there is room for something more, something that will reach beyond the pages and touch John's tomorrow in a way only he will see.
While this works, there is something lacking.
It is one of those hard-to-define qualities that marks the difference between a good book and one that is outstanding.
Maybe it's the heavy reliance on John's soldiering as an excuse for certain behaviors.
Or perhaps it has more to do with aspects relating to John's relationship with his father, who appears to have Asperger's syndrome.
I'm giving DEAR JOHN 4-Books for a beautiful story, but not five because of that indefinable element that was lost between idea and paper.

Paul Auster's City of Glass is perhaps the worst read I've experienced.
The story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious; the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself; we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated--I kid you not.
The best part of this novel is the end.
I read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid; however, I was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams.
To all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical, existential tour de-force, I beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ.
I believe the author had no such thoughts in mind, had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining, dry-dry-dry piece of fiction with one or two not-so-clever plot devices, gather such literary praise.
Like a Rorschach image you can see life, love, death, a myriad of wonderful symbols, and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth, intepret and dwell in that depth--coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life, well, then, good for you.
But in reality, the person that made that Rorschach for you is Auster, and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you All bought it...hook line and sinker.
This novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere, show us little on the way and still receive praise, despite an ending which is refelctive of the entire work, in that it plain and simply: sucks
BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, the textbook currently used in my Introduction to Management class, does not effectively convey the important fundamentals of business management.
The book is structured around eight 'roles' of an effective manager, and each role is further broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that particular role.
While I appreciate the effort to organize a relatively broad subject, I do not feel that the book is necessarily easy to follow.
The reading is constantly being interrupted by assessments and applications for each competency, and while meant well, they are usually skipped over in an attempted to finish the reading and they seem to me to be a large waste of paper.
Furthermore, BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER stresses models and theories of management that I find useless without the necessary fundamentals of management, which are not adequately presented in the textbook.
Some of the models and theories have merit and should be discussed more in depth, but in a more advanced level of business management.
And while BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER is the official textbook for my management class, I have relied heavily on a different textbook for my information, and only the eve of a test do I bother to look over BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, I do not recommend this textbook for an introductory class at all
If you read one book on food ethics in your life, it should be this book.
Singer and Mason's book is an excellently researched and foot-noted exploration of three different American diets, tracing these diets back to their sources and showing the many hidden affects that our food choices have on our environment, our neighbors, the animals that many of us eat, and ultimately ourselves.
This book shows how these seemingly innocuous choices really do make a difference in our world, and then guides the reader towards resources which might help them make different choices, if they so choose.
This book is not only full of an amazing depth and breadth of information on everything from organics, to local food, to intensive factory farms, to fair trade products, it also is immensely readable.
The meetings with the three different families are very vivid and help to humanize these issues further.
I highly recommend this book to every thinking person who eats.
Which is, really, all of us.
Please read this book!
Do yourself, your neighbors and your planet a favor!

This book shows how Robert has been lying all along.
He talks about how he bought his dream car while being homeless.
Ok then, how did Robert make the monthly payment?
Why would he be stupid enough to sleep in a Porsch as a bum?

He is a conman and a good one.
Thats why hes a motivational speaker.

Don't fall for this conman!
This book contradicts what Robert has been preaching in previous books.
Robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless.
That would be odd but it isn't odd because Robert is a professional liar
Since God is Infinite Goodness, we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion.
When we are comfortable, we are too shallow-minded to realize that we need God.
Since God knows that He is the only thing that we really need, He inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact.
So pain is God's megaphone.
If some people, such as the Jews, try to love God without going through Christ, it is not yet God - merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain.
Hence poor God is forced to keep screeching at them through His megaphone.
But even people who try their hardest to love the true God, such as Job, or C. S. Lewis for that matter, cannot adore God as much as He wants to be adored, so He uses pain over and over again to "plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls."
Where does this notion of an Infinitely Good God come from?
Given mankind's painful existence, "an inference from the course of events in this world to the Goodness and Wisdom of the Creator would be preposterous."
God had to reveal Himself to mankind by Revelation; thus it is in the likes of Abraham and Moses, who identified God as righteous, that all peoples are blessed.
Lewis informs us that God expostulated with His own creatures on the basis of their own ethical conceptions - "What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me?"
One has to wonder if Lewis has ever actually read the Bible.
Can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that Abraham and Moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters?
I have never understood why, or how, I am supposed to pretend that this is not true.
Of course, God is wiser than me, so if I could only see it from God's viewpoint, I would see that the butchery of whole populations, including babies and animals, was actually an act of love.
In MERE CHRISTIANITY Lewis condemns this line of reasoning in eastern religions as "damn nonsense."
Undoubtedly, we get the impression of a just and loving God through the teachings of Christ, but the conviction that God is Infinite Goodness, Omniscience, and Omnipotence did not come from biblical revelation; it was developed by medieval Christian philosophers by reasoning through extrapolation -- a process that Lewis, rather inexplicably, deems impossible.
Lewis's insistence that people have free will needs to be examined.
Even as he describes it, since we are born in sin, we cannot use free will to avoid sin, and most people are blind to their sin.
Hence, it logically follows that there can be no free will without the ability of self-perception.
The evidence suggests that incessant pain, especially when inflicted upon children, destroys this ability.
Abused children typically grow up to be abusers.
In my own case, I adamantly insist it was the drug, marijuana, which first gave me introspective ability, at the age of 23.
Prior to that moment, God knows that I had no free will.
Free will is not a realized trait that we are born with, but a potential ability that requires a great deal of effort to develop.
In most people it remains largely dormant.
Since free will is dependent on self-knowledge, the role of religion needs to be the development of introspective ability.
Dogmatic adherence can only hinder this.
Lewis is at least honest enough to acknowledge evolution.
Unfortunately, it is hardly possible to reconcile the notion of evolution of man from animals with his fairy-tale notion that animals only exist by destroying each other because they were corrupted by Satan before man's appearance on Earth.
Somehow, the perfectly good "Paradisal Man" descended from animals already corrupted by Satan.
Lewis can be abominably silly sometimes.
Lewis is given to disjunctive, either/or, logic.
Either the common human experience of supernatural awe is a mere twist in the mind with no biological purpose, or it is direct experience of the supernatural - a Revelation.
I would once have scoffed at this, but a Numinous vision of Christ was the major turning point of my life.
The problem is that this Revelation was not at all consistent with Mere Christianity.
According to Lewis, the purpose of pain is to break our will, since it is our tarnished wills that keep us from God.
I had only recently come to realize that I had not had free will until my sense of self was awakened by an illegal drug.
I experienced Christ in the very moment that I was cursing Christ for demanding that I beg forgiveness for that which He was responsible.
Albeit, at the time I was an atheist, and was only cursing at what I had been taught about Christ.
I experienced Christ as the core of my being, not as an entity completely separate from myself, and as an awakening of will, not a surrender.
Lewis assures me that the feeling of being one with God, rather than a creature of God, is Satan's ultimate deception.
But I have also experienced Satan within myself.
If Christ were not the core of my being, I would never have survived Satan.
I know the difference.
I do not acknowledge that Christianity has the authority tell me what my experience of God must be.
I am a scientist by training, not given to superstitious credulity, however much like it what I have written above must sound.
In my attempt to make sense of my experience of Christ and Satan battling within my mind, I have come up with the following myth: It is, at least, not completely unreasonable to assume that consciousness is an inherent quality of existence.
This consciousness would first be in a primordial state, probably in some way responsible for evolution, though not by anything like intelligent design by direct control.
There could be no distinction between good and evil; in fact the terms could have no meaning, until consciousness evolved to a complexity capable of self-awareness.
As self-awareness developed, so did awareness of pain and terror, and a rebellion against achieving a level of awareness capable of experiencing pain.
The human mind, as the vessel of consciousness experiences these antagonistic trends and, for whatever reason, tends to personify them as God and Satan, or their various cultural equivalents.
What makes the Christian God so detestable is His complete refusal to accept responsibility for anything.
Satan can therefore be described as "God's self-ignorance."
Buddhists are apparently able to put themselves into the conscious state of inanimate matter, hence there insistence that good and evil are identical.
C. S. Lewis tells us that "it is not God's purpose that we should go back into that old identity."
I think I agree with him on this point.
Mankind's goal must be to attain free will be becoming conscious of what we really are.
(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA: A YOUNG MAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF)
I studied the medieval Islamic world a little in college, and fell in love.
It's a fascinating age in which Central Asian Buddhists, North African nomads, Ethiopian slaves, Greek cave-dwellers, Persian aristocrats, Arab bureaucrats and a host of different cultures came together, mixed, wrote wonderful literature, and lived the kind of drama that makes history fun.
But it's hard to find anything written about the time that isn't arcane professor babble or Islam 101.
(You know, "There are five pillars of Islam..." Snore.)
Here Hugh Kennedy has written the book I always wanted.
He wisely concentrates on medieval Islam's golden age, the early Abbasid dynasty, when Baghdad ruled a large portion of the world-and, even more astutely, on the dramatic stories and personalities of the court.
Let's face it, you read about the Abbasids because you want to know how the slave girl Khayzuran not only managed to marry the caliph but to quell a military revolt, why her son Harun al-Rashid was immortalized in The Arabian Nights, and why the all-powerful Barmakid family suddenly fell from grace to prison and execution.
Kennedy brings the caliphs and their families to life.
He's up front about the fact that the book is about aristocrats, but the common people of Baghdad, the "pickpockets and sellers of cheap sweets" who fought back when their city was besieged, and the middle class who developed Islamic tradition dance around the edge of the narrative.
Kennedy doesn't believe everything he reads, and doesn't think you will either.
He repeats stories-like the "harem intrigue" tales, in which devious women are blamed for various deaths-that are almost certainly not true, but tell us something about the people who believed them, and are still enormously entertaining.
He also is frank about the same-sex relationships, male and female, that were a part of the era's culture, without the awkwardness of many modern historians.
And he's smart enough to explain the geography-why southern Iraq could support such a fabulously wealthy monarchy, and why the Afghanistan/NE Iran region was so critical to the faraway Middle East-in a way an American can understand.
Very rare for books on Islamic history, the book boasts an excellent map, naming both cities and regions-invaluable for a hapless Westerner who doesn't know where the major cities of Iran are today, never mind where long-gone kingdoms like Yamama and Ushrusana used to be.
There's also a surprisingly good index (another rarity).
The book isn't flawless.
Kennedy twice awkwardly interrupts his straightforward account of political events with fascinating chapters on aspects of court culture-palaces, poetry, science, and (my favorite) women's lives.
Unfortunately, this structure means the reader learns about the palace Mutawakkil built before she knows enough about him to care, and doesn't hear anything about Ma'mun patronage of scientific research until long after he's dead in the main narrative.
The last chapter goes into far too much detail about the depressing downfall of the dynasty, short-changing a more interesting discussion about its legacy.
But all in all Kennedy does a great job, and I for one plan down to hunt down his earlier books.
If you know nothing about Islamic history and want an accessible introduction to an fascinating period, or like me know a little and want to learn more, I highly recommend this book
I was anxious to try the Artisanal gougere recipe, and I was not disappointed!
The cheese puffs were light and cheesey and beautiful to look at!
I compared his recipe to Le Cordon Blue recipe, and his adds a pinch of baking powder and about 2-3 times the amount of cheese.
Plus he give approximate mixing times, which was a blessing for me since I had never made cream puff dough before.
The Cordon Blue version had no mixing times and with such a small amount of cheese compared to the Artisanal version I cannot believe that it would be anywhere near as good.
This book appears to have Terence's personal touch, not just regurgitation of classic bistro recipes

As one reads Peter Pan, one doesn't have to do much thinking to figure out why its story has achieved such worldwide acclaim.
I had ridiculously high expectations of Mr. Barrie's imagination before purchasing this title, and he has fulfilled them completely.
Many parts of the story are nothing but nonsense, which I enjoy above all else.
Mr.
Darling, the head of the Darling family, commands his children to take their medicine after he hides the medicine he's supposed to take.
He brags about how noble he is for drinking a medicine that tastes so much worse that theirs.
Unfortunately for him, during his bragging his medicine is found, and the whole family agrees to take their respective medicines on the count of three.
Sure enough, when three is reached, everyone except Mr.
Darling takes their medicine, and Mr.
Darling once again tries to hide his.
This kind of scenario is what I'd call Mark Twain nonsense.
You can imagine it being true, even though it's quite high up on the ridiculous scale.
Then there's what I would classify as over-the-top nonsense - AKA bull - which there is plenty of in Barrie's original story of Peter Pan.
Going back to Mr.
Darling, if we take a look at how he's doing near the end of the book, we find him going to and from work in a dog kennel.
Ah, yes...grown men in pet taxis.
What could be more fun than the "he-didn't-even-try-to-make-this-belivable" silliness of such a scene?
To be honest, I don't know if I'd even read books if they all left out fun stuff like this.
Other silly parts of the book involve Wendy growing up a day quicker than most girls; the narrator claiming he hates Mrs.
Darling only to call her his favorite character a few sentences later; the lost boys asking Wendy to change the characters her story just two sentences into it; the narrator using the phrase "woke into life" because Peter likes the word "woke" more than "wakened;" and my favorite, Captain Hook using a stale cake as a missle and then falling over it in the dark.
I believe the novel version of Peter Pan was written after the author had already established Peter Pan as a successful play.
That may explain a lot about the colorful narration, which takes many, many literary liberties.
We see everything from blatant narrator interference with the characters in the story to the shameless attempt at informing the audience that the narrator only chooses to make the events in the story happen a certain way so certain characters in the book won't be disappointed.
Perhaps without these wacky (and maybe even insane) traits in the narration, there'd be no reason to read the book, since it would be no different from the play.
After reading the Peter Pan novel though, I'd have to say it almost seems criminal to watch an adaptation of Peter Pan without any wacky narration.
Contrary to most adaptations of Peter Pan, the individual lost boys (of where there are six I believe) are actually more developed as characters than John or Michael Darling.
Heck, at the end of the book they actually end up moving out of the Neverland to live with the Darlings and grow up to busy themselves in interesting professions.
I may not like the actual land of Neverland as much as I like the land of Oz, but Barrie's narration is unbeatable in my opinion.
He could probably make a Jeopardy contestant's Friday night schedule sound exciting.
I believe Barrie has written another Peter Pan book as well, a prequel of sorts entitled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens."
It should be interesting, particuarly if it addresses what is contained in the dark dreams that haunt Peter throughout this book.
Freud would have a field day with such dreams and the whole mother issue.
The only thing I expected to see in this book that I didn't see was "happy thoughts."
That must have been a creation of Disney
I recently read "I", "K", and "L" in succession.
Compared to "Innocent" and "Killer", I found Lawless to be slow paced (even though this edition finds Kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country) and the plot twists less surprising.
With others I've read in the series, I am usually hooked relatively early in the story line.
I was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome.
Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...).
I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in "L" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next.
Anyway, there are others in this series I would recommend more highly ("M" being one of them)
Being a dyed-in-the-wool Mcguane fan, I think he just keeps getting better.
Not only is he the best fishing writer alive, but his non-fishing stories are bizzarely entertaining, have an interesting twist, and always explore human interaction.
I believe his writing is based on his many and varied experiences, from crazy street people to ego-crazed CEOs, as well as the many places he has lived.

I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc.
However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.
For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate.
I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.
Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author.
Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive.
She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work.
In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.
The first half of the book is also really dry.
This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly!
The book started to pick up about half way through.
Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.
However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women.
I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March).
The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.
In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee."
If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book?
Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now!
I found this book extremely verbose and unorganized.
It would serve as a great reference book for a lab researcher or grad student.
But it's way too technical and dense for an introductory genetics class.

I enjoyed the plot and the characters -- it was very funny.
But there were too many grammar mistakes in the book, which I found too irritating and distracted from the book.
Some conversations did not flow logically -- one person would answer herself, which didn't make sense.
Also, the author switches from 1st person to 3rd person with the character of Nickel.
And she used 'to' instead of 'too.'
As a former copy editor and English major, this was very distracting!
But overall, a great book.
I plan on getting the next 2
I bought this book because it was required for a class I am taking.
I had the 3rd Edition already and wasn't too impressed.
But this 5th Edition is much more appealing.
I just became PMP certified and reviewing this book before taking the exam was a great primer to get my head out of pure PMBOK and into real world Project Management.
The case studies and Directed Readings are great for seeing real world PM activities.
I would suggest the book for guidance and classroom type learning.
If you're an experienced PM then this book is too academic and won't feed your intellect.
Buy something else
I was so excited when I initially bought this book and honestly, when I read it I was disappointed.
I thought it was a bit dry and boring to read through, despite the useful tips.
Although the authors try hard, they really don't convey the spirit and fun that college life has to offer
Is this a book of New Yorker cartoons or a puzzle book?
Well, it's a little of both, and the result is a novel way to laugh and exercise your brain at the same time.
Most of the 83 puzzles consist of cartoons that are missing words, captions, or picture components.
By figuring out the missing elements and sometimes combining them with acrostics, crossword puzzles, or other word grids, the cartoon humor is revealed.
For the most part, the puzzles are of only moderate difficulty, although there are a few difficult ones (at least for me) that involve matching a cartoon with the decade in which it was created or matching cartoons from early and late in a cartoonist's career.
Frequent puzzle solvers will recognize many of the familiar puzzle types from Games Magazine and other media that Puzzability publishes in.
The foreword to the book contains a casual and loosely coupled conversation between New Yorker cartoon editor Robert Mankoff and New York Times puzzle editor Will Shortz.
This is an entertaining book that you'll hate to throw away when it's been completed because of all the witty cartoons it contains.
Enjoy!

While not written at the level of technical philosophical detail as Aquinas or Pannenberg (as another review here stresses), this text is still set apart from most general theological treatments by its philosophical clarity and coherence.
This is in addition to the virtues of its serious treatment of the range of Scriptural data concerning each topic, its apologetic engagement with differing views, and its practical counsel for life and ministry.
It is a great resource for thinking through major theological issues and positions.
I recommend it highly
Great gift from Grandmother.
Children love this book.
It's a great book for anybody learning the English language.
EVERY class should have this book.
This is a gift that everybody appreciates.
Get the book down for the child to look at and learn.
Great teaching tool!
Exceptional pictures!
I always buy two--one for the new grandchild, and a copy goes to the school, when they start school.
You have my vote for the VERY BEST
The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together.
The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental.
By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation.
I wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up, stay focused, and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand
This is an excellent book if used correctly.
When you apply everything that the books says to your life it will change things for the positive.
It is a realistic approach to evangelism that really works
Dr. Alex Delaware is completely incorrigible!
I love this character, but no wonder his pal Milo is going gray - keeping Alex out of trouble is a full time job!
There is a scene in this one where Milo tells Alex straight out not to go snooping - he tells him, "I know you ..." Yeah, Milo knows him all right, and so do we, don't we?
(And if you don't - read the books!
They're great!)
Okay, Alex is a clinical psychologist who is semi-retired, does mostly forensic work now for the court and the police.
His best friend Milo Sturgis is a homicide detective with the LAPD.
Once Alex gets involved in a mystery, he is incapable of letting it go.
In all fairness, it is Milo who gets him involved in this one.
Alex and his girlfriend Robin are rebuilding their house - she's a carpenter, so she's very hands-on with the rebuilding.
In the meantime, they're living on the beach in Malibu.
Sweet.
Milo is quite taken by one of the jurors involved in a particularly gruesome and high profile case.
Ever since the trial, Lucy Lowell has been having nightmares and Milo asks his friend Alex to try to help her.
She's quite a character and Alex is taken by her too.
(Things get a little complicated when she reveals her crush on Milo - FINALLY!
A woman falls for Milo!
(I'm not the only one!)
The fact he's gay does put a crimp in things, but no matter).
While her recurring dream becomes more intense, other strange happenings have her - and everyone else - questioning her sanity.
But there is obviously more going on than anyone originally thought and Alex is afraid maybe this dream is not a nightmare at all, but a long suppressed childhood memory.
The memory of a murder.
Milo is tied up with another complicated case, so Alex goes off digging on his own - again.
I had to laugh - several times, Alex comments about doing something "on impulse" and I'm sitting there waiting for someone to try to kill him.
The lies come so easy for him in this one - he's been getting a lot of practice.
He pretends to be a journalist, a freelance novelist, a publisher and he even manages to keep his lies straight - he's amazing!
But the inevitable happens and he and Lucy find themselves staring down the wrong end of a gun.
The mystery is 20 years old, so it's a very cold trail and a very complicated case - you won't figure it out - the ending is quite a surprise
This book is built around the idea "I wish it were true = it is true".
While this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives, if you're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life (i.e.
intellectual integrity), you'd be better off buying an introduction to probability
It is quite rare that a book appears that is this good; but this book is so good that even men (I am male) can (i.e.
should) enjoy it.
A groundbreaking, unabashedly feminist (wo)manifesto, The Vagina Monologues has given voice to countless women in the past ten years, and has ushered in a new era of sexual liberation.
If you are still incredulous, ask yourself how many books published hitherto so much as had the word 'vagina', let alone all the facts thereabout in it?
A wonderful book
In addition to the fact that I, too, felt that I was enduring a commercial for DFA, I was annoyed by the fact that this book is nothing more than a rehash of The Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You'll Ever Need: Index Mutual Funds and Beyond - The Way Smart Money Invests Today, Swedroe's May, 1998 book.
He introduces a small number of new studies and illustrations, but if you've read the first book, there's no reason to look at this one
With the hype over the Da Vinci Code and its related popularity, you can sometimes get the feeling that some people probably think the grand conspiracy novel started with Dan Brown.
Of course, this is not the case, as Brown is merely one in a long line of such thriller writers.
Probably the biggest in the bunch was Robert Ludlum, but not to be forgotten is Jon Land.
Not quite the big name that Ludlum or Brown, Land is nonetheless the most pure fun, with outlandish plots and tons of action.
The Last Prophecy brings back Danielle Barnea, an ex-Israeli cop and Ben Kamal, a former Palestinian detective.
Despite the obvious conflicts caused by their different backgrounds, the two are faithful lovers and, as the novel begins, both working as investigators for the U.N.
In this case, the two are called to look into a mass murder in a Palestinian village.
At first, it appears to be a massacre by Israeli troops, but it soon enough appears to be something far more sinister, a conspiracy tied to events uncovered at the World War II and some lost prophecies of Nostradamus.
The last of these prophecies provides the key to the conspiracy.
Land uses his standard formula for his Barnea/Kamal novels: the two split up for the majority of the book to separately unearth parts of the plot only to converge at the end to stop the bad guys.
Typically, the people who provide the information are assassinated by the villains before they can reveal all.
This formula works well enough since Land executes it well (and really, Brown and Ludlum use a similar formula themselves).
I won't say this is perfect writing, but it's plenty good enough to merit a strong four stars.
My biggest "problem" with Land is that he is only writing books featuring Barnea and Kamal; I miss his older novels with Blaine McCracken, which were even more delightfully outlandish with their James Bond-like world conquest plots.
But in the absence of McCracken, this series still fits the bill for what Land does best: entertain from beginning to end.
My sons, 4 and 8, saw this book at a well know book store and loved it.
It costs $20.00 there, so $13.00 is a steal.
They love the pictures and the book is very attractive and "cool" looking
I thought this was an excellent book.
Those who say this won't turn you into a champion overnight, I've got news for you - NO book can do that.
Only you can...I've raced (retired now) for most of my adult life including some pro races, some of my crew have gone onto Champ cars, NASCAR, and F1, I was lucky enough to be associated with a team that won the Champ car title and my engineer was from that team.
This book gives excellent information and if you can read between the lines you will learn quite a bit that can help you in your racing career.
Those who can't learn anything from this book are advanced enough they don't need to buy any books, but most of us don't have last names like Andretti, Senna, Unser, etc.
If any of you have ever read Senna's book on driving you might also say it's nothing special but you need to read between the lines and figure out what he is alluding to, not what he writes directly about.
Few people will directly give you the "secrets" to motorsports
One of the few Roald Dahl books I read, it remains one of my favorites from childhood.
I saw the movie too, and the movie is very funny, and I felt it did the book justice.
Matilda is about a precocious little girl named Matilda who has a crazy family (who doesn't support her at all and certainly doesn't respect her intelligence).
At a very young age, she is able to read very advanced books and she wins the admiration of her new teacher Mrs. Honey.
The only problem is her dim parents and the evil Mrs. Trunchbull who rules the school with an iron fist.
And then there's Matilda's new found super powers.
It's very funny, the predicaments Matilda gets into and the things Mrs. Trunchbull says, even if she is cruel.
It might be a little scary to very young children, but it depends on the child
This book is 'oragnized' into sections - Getting Started, Organizing Room by Room, Organizing Finances, Organizing Time, Organizing Home Life, and Organizing Transitions.
Who needs an entire section telling you the benefits of being organized - isn't that why I bought the book?
The author takes 'plain and simple' to new heights...for example - "To organize your refrigerator, start by uncluttering it."
I was hoping for something with more substance.
There was nothing in this book that I didn't already know.
If you're looking for something very basic as far as what to do in your home...you will like this book
I originally bought this title when it came out as a four-part mini series in 1997 and it is still one of the favorites in my collection.
Kingdome Come is an Elseworlds (what if) story set approximately ten years after the retirement of Superman and subsequently nearly every other super hero.
As the story unfolds, the reason Superman quit is revealed.
A rival hero named Magog killed the Joker and was put on trial for murder.
When the public cried out for his aquittal and it was granted, Superman quit in disgust.
The results of the public choosing a hero that would kill are very apparent in the future.
The children of the super heroes we know are everywhere.
They hold society in a state of terror as they enforce justice and fight each other in the way they see fit, destroying property and causing chaos.
Wonder Woman approaches Superman in his self-imposed exile in the nuclear wastleland that is Kansas and asks him to return and lead the former heroes in returning order.
When Superman returns to the public eye in issue #2, it sets into motion an Apocalypse as described in the Bible, but with Superheroes being the catalyst.
The new Justice League rounds up every violent super human and puts them into a prison designed by Mister Miracle(The world's greatest escape artist) called the Gulag.
All this is shown from the viewpoint of Norman McCray, a disillusioned pastor and friend of the Golden Age Sandman.
He is led on his journey by the Spectre (DC's Angel of Death) I absolutely love this story by Mark Waid, the way he wraps comic characters and events into a Biblical epic is brilliant.
The painted art by Alex Ross is jaw-dropping in it's realism.
The re-imagined characters are god-like in their depiction, especially the Flash- a red blur wrapped in lightning wearing a winged Greek helmet.
Issue #3 ends in a cliff-hanger with all the villains rioting and breaking out of the Gulag.
As Superman races to the scene, he is thrown to the ground by the only person that could, Captain Marvel.
I still remember waiting for issue #4 to come out.
The fight scene between Captain Marvel and Superman was voted #1 all-time by Wizard magazine and is worth the price of this trade alone.
Even without this fight scene, I would rate this as one of the ten greatest mini-series ever, but with it Kingdom Come is #1.
The only possible negative to this series is that you have to already know something about comics to fully appreciate all the subtleties Waid and Ross weave into this story.
Nearly every DC character is pictured at least once.
(A geek's paradise I guess) After reading this I actually liked Captain Marvel, who I had always seen as an even cheesier version of Superman.
The fear the other heroes have of him and his power level make him hard to laugh at, despite Jerry Ordway's Power of Shazam monthly series to the contrary.
I hope my description of the story has led any undecided mind to pick this up.
Fabulous art and incredible writing.
(This should be 5 stars, but I can't seem to edit my rating
Each Planet listed in this book has details on length of day, length of year, species, population, size, climate, terrain, pppppppppp much more.
Each one also has a picture of the planet accompanying it.
There's also a map of the core worlds along with key location / site maps on nearly every listed planet(very cool).
Coruscant has a huge 29-page entry to it.
It also has the GM character Dexter Jettster, info on the Jedi Temple, and many more spots on this planet.
Great for many, many adventures.
Alderaan pppppppppp Corellia get around 7-pages.
There's also a few new species, many new creatures, and a lot of GM characters to throw at Players.
Some starships are also in here, inlcuding : TIE/Ad Defender prototype pppppppppp E-Wing.
My only complaint is, there AREN'T more of these Planet books out there for this RPG.
WotC could have done a series of Secrets of... books for each system (or something like that.)
Otherwise, there ARE a lot of things in this book that will make players believe that their characters are in STAR WARS.
So, yes, buy the book!
Support this space fantasy RPG
if you ever eat fast food after reading this book, you obviously didnt read it.
it covers how the fast food industry has changed america for the worst.
how they manipulate kids into eating fast food.
the conditions of the animals that are raised to be eaten.
the diet of the animals.
what goes on in the slaughter houses.
how they have made the farmers go out of business.
how the restarunts are run.
fast food in schools and much more
This book states that it's better to die than survive a rape: "Also far-reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity.
Once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained.
Even in a forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged.
If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position.
There is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation.
It is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle."
(p.196) How much more twisted can it get?
This book, by the way, was published in 1988, NOT 1998 as the notes above indicate.
It is also reflected in the books theme and attitude.
I have read three chapters so far and this is what I have gleaned from the book: 1) Your daughter will only be "successful" if she chooses male oriented occupations.
2) Your daughter will only be "successful" if she is a doctor, NOT a nurse.
Heaven forbid she be a nurse, housewife, teacher.
3) Your daughter won't be "successful" if she goes to a coed school.
Send her to a female only institution, that way she only has to compete against other girls.
4) Your daughter won't be a success without playing poker, chess or other strategy games.
Don't even think of pulling out Dora or some other "girl" game.
Surely there must be better books for Dads to gain some info on theie daughters and ways to help them along as they grow.
I could go on with more examples from this feminist rant, but frankly don't have the time.
My daughter and I are going to kick the soccer ball.
And BTW, don't even let her enjoy an english class or play with dolls.
Force her into that science and math slot.
Sign her up for computer camp because we all know that PC's are designed strictly for boys.
I really feel this book is outdated, both in examples and most importantly, attitude.
Try something different.
I have bought many books in my life, but Randy Gage's "Why You're Dumb, Sick and Broke" is the first time I ever bought a book with a parental advisory warning for explicit language.
Gage does things a little differently than anyone else, which is something I quickly discovered when reading this book.
This book is brash, to the point and filled with insight and inspiration.
I thought that Gage presented his points in a well thought out manner that really took the establishment on head on.
Many points presented in the book are in other personal development books.
However, I don't know of any book that has all these points in one book.
Even Gage himself admits in an interview that this is a combination of Think and Grow Rich, The Secret, Ayn Rand and several other books and cd's.
A lot of it you have heard before, like if you say you are broke, then you will always be broke.
However, I didn't realize how much the mainstream media and the political establishment are contributing to our negative, broke thoughts.
Most frightening of all, I learned why the establishment needs us to be broke in order to keep their power.
I am taking Randy's lead and watching less TV, especially the news.
That's the worst of all!
There is also a nice introduction to Libertarianism and the works of Ayn Rand.
As a Libertarian myself, I was delighted to see this included in the book.
With recent reports circulating about Britain on the verge of becoming a police state, this warning about big government couldn't have come at a more appropriate time.
As expected, Randy does make a plug for MLM, but this is by no means an MLM book.
The MLM plug is just a few short pages.
However, it is still a nice resource for MLM people to use for third party credibility.
He also mentioned real estate and information marketing as good businesses as well.
I must be smart, healthy and rich, as I am already involved in all three.
I found myself nodding in agreement to this book.
I also found a lot of places where I was thinking, "Oh, I'm not the only one who this this way.
Why hasn't this been mentioned before in the press?"
Other times, I thought, "Oh my god, I am being really manipulated here."
While he was "preaching to the choir" with me, I'm sure that many people with more "mainstream" views will feel more challenged reading this book.
Bottom line, if you love MLM get 10 copies of this book, if you support the Libertarians, get 10 copies of this book.
If you are like me and love them both, get 25 copies.

I have had this book for 9 years and it continues to be my favorite.
I have several other quotation books, but I always keep coming back to this one.
It covers many topics that are categorized in a user friendly format which makes searching for the perfect quote a breeze.
I recommend this book for the quotation fanatic
This is my all time favorite book!
I have never found myself going through so many different emotions while reading one book.
It is definately one of Nicholas Sparks bests
Buy a Girls Gotta Do What a Girls Gotta Do instead.
Snortland's book is more of a feminist's political treastise on how males and females are raised and nurtured versus a pragmatic approach on skills to identify potential threats and strategies to deal with them.
She does hype Impact training which sounds like a beneficial program.
I bought it for my daughter, but read it first.
Actually, I tried to read it; halfway through the book I decided to toss it.
This is a great compliment to the more project-based MAKE magazine, as it focuses a little more on the personalities of the "makers."
Of course, it also describes (and shows, in beautiful photographs), their projects, but it's a great way to see into the personal side of the amateur engineers, bored brainiacs, and fringe-worthy souls who are the heart of the newest form of the DIY geek culture: creating incredible, real-world projects, from the mega (a home built submarine for 3) to the micro, (a diy bat detector), to the whimsical (a Lego blocks project that will solve the Rubik's Cube).
If you're a vociferous reader of Slashdot, you may have seen some of these projects before, but the book really gets into the motivation behind them.
Production values, writing, and design are superb, and of course, URLs are provided so you can find out more on the makers' sites.
Bottom line, this fascinating survery of Make culture (and cool projects) is a must for every geek's coffee table, and it's also a great way to introduce your mom into what it is you actually do with your spare time..
'A Little History of the World' is exactly what the title indicates.
Gombrich takes the reader from the dawn of time to the mid-twentieth century.
Gombrich covers cave men, great religious leaders, philosophers, and events over an incredible timeline.
I got this book for my eight year old son and I to read together.
There were certain chapters and topics which grapped his attention.
Other chapters were a little over his head in regards to understanding the causes for certain events.
In particular, the chapters covering the Inquisition and the causes that lead to the French Revolution were a little difficult for him to truely understand.
This book is a great way to introduce a child to the wonderful stories that make up the world we live in.
It may also be a stepping stone to further reading on subjects that spark some interest
My son (34) is currently incarcerated.
He asked for this book so I had it sent to him.
He holds on to it for dear life and swears, had he read this years ago, it would have changed his life for the better and he wouldn't be where he's at.
He raved so much, he insisted I order one for myself.
I did.
In summary, what I derived from the reading was one must be callous in this life and put yourself first.
Otherwise, you'll be no more than a stepping stone for others.
It's a good book but I oftentimes got lost in all its references to those that preceded us by 500-600 years.
Fellow inmates that have the book feel the same as my son.
It's a Bible to them and they refuse to part with it for others to read for fear it will never be returned to them
In a sea of books from self-proclaimed "career counselors," Mr. Corcodilos has no-nonsense advice from a true insider.
Instead of the usual yada-yada, Corcodilos explains how a candidate can stand out in a sea of prospective employees clambering in a recruiting system designed to produce the status quo.
One hears a lot of complaints from hiring managers that effective, qualified employees are in short supply.
However, Corcodilos lays bare the true cause of this corporate angst: The present recruiting system is broken.
Ask the headhunter is worthwhile reading for both the candidate and the hiring manager; two agents who are in desperate need to meet
How some people gave this book a five star review is way beyond me.
First of all, I'd just like to mention that this nice book gives you schematic diagrams using symbols and other things without explaining them first!
Secondly, if you want to understand electronics it can only be assumed that you want to understand the physics behind it!
This book dedicates about a sentence to a paragraph to physics for each section.
Horrible!
So basically, this INTRODUCTION to electronics doesn't do a lot of introducing you to anything!
I'm on transistors right now, and I've spent days researching the physics of how they work on the Internet, and guess what?
It's using schematics I don't understand, and yet again I'm going to have to do more looking on the net.
This book is not worth it.
Don't buy it!
Just please, for your own sake, find another one.
Also, half the book is dedicated to projects.
That is, actually building electronic circuits!
Why didn't the author just entitle this, "How to build electronic devices", then?
It's beyond me!
As far as explaining things are concerned, the book does very little, and assume you know more than you do.
Unfortunately I'm going to have to end up buying another electronics textbook, because this one is just horrible.
I was really wanting to learn something from this book, but it's just not happening.
For every chapter I've read on this book I've had to do research on the net, and I'm sick of it.
I'm on pg.
154, and I'm closing it.
DO NOT buy this book!
I've already found a better book on amazon.com (just buy reading the Table of Contents!!!!!!!!!!)
and I'm going to get it!
Dr. Gray must be a wonderful lover.
As a woman I read his hints and suggestions for a man's love making technique and marvel at his insight.
I truly could not have imagined a man so aware of what a woman really wants in the bedroom.
However there are no corresponding ideas for a woman geared to improviing her skills as a lover.
By maintaining a position of gallant "ladies first" mentality he, in truth, is demeaning the power of women's sexuality.
There is much to be gained by men reading this book.
Attitudes can improve, skill levels can rise and even the articulation of loving feelings can be created and/or grow with the help of this book's suggestions.
Women are unfortunately reduced to being receipients of, not participants in, in bedroom activity
This is a great devotional book.
The book uses an engaging, real-life story to set the context.
I read it with my kids every night and they look forward to the little story and they take turns guessing the correct behavior.
The included bible reference provides the ultimate answer and it is a great way to introduce bible teaching to the kids
George DeWolfe sees the photographer as an artist, not a technician, yet his book provides the technical knowledge and shows how to use Photoshop to create consistently high quality fine art prints.
Writing for the experienced photographer with a basic knowledge of Photoshop, DeWolfe begins by showing the photographer, with many examples, how to evaluate an image and decide what adjustments will bring out its special qualities.
The experienced photographer has always used his or her understanding of how light, luminosity and color give life to an image, and has traditionally used various techniques in the darkroom to enhance them.
DeWolfe begins by training the eye of the artist to see these elements and understand how they work.
After showing the reader how to truly see the image and decide how to fine-tune it, DeWolfe then gives us a very detailed digital workflow which, once mastered, allows the photographer to produce excellent prints on a consistent basis.
The workflow is clarified by many screen shots showing Photoshop techniques and before/after image adjustments.
Those who think visually will find these particularly helpful.
DeWolfe's approach is to use the simplest techniques that can produce consistently fine results.
(Some Photoshop users will be surprised by his use of the history brush instead of masking; as a photographer who uses this tool, I appreciate its simplicity and controlled results.)
His focus is not on "tips-and-tricks in Photoshop", but on how to get the best possible prints in the simplest, most straightforward way.
While a first reading gives valuable insights, the book's true value becomes evident when the photographer uses the workflow on his or her own images, and practices to become proficient.
The proof, as they say, is in the print
King did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one.
There were some areas that could have been condensed and were sometimes confusing.
For the most part, not bad.
Would make a good movie
I read this book and could not put it down.
Mr Moyers will change the way of thinking for many as this disease has no limitations on the age in which this disease affects someone and all those around them.
This book has insight and boundless wisdom for all generations involved.
I would recommend all colleges make it madatory reading, and only wish somehow every adult knew it was available.
Very little plot, which is boring.
The reader should be paid by the page, if not by the word, to read this book!
A good and clear illustrated guide to exercises with both machines and free weights.
Also the best methods for each body type outlined.
You even get sample workouts for people at all levels of fitness and exercise development.
The book shows exercises for each body part so you can develop your own routine and it also includes a log you can copy.
The book includes routines for seniors and weight loss.
There are some 300 color photos and you'll learn how to do each exercise and what to avoid that may cause injury.
A good book for anyone at any level of fitness who needs a complete, handy guide.
Being spiral bound it will go with you and you can easily use it daily.
My one complaint is that some of the routines are devoted to using machines only and many people don't belong to a gym but work out at home.
For them, this creates a real problem
My only caveat about this otherwise enjoyable installment in the Eve Dallas series is that the web site did not prominently state (i.e., I missed it!)
that this had previously been published as part of an anthology.
I made the mistake of only checking the publishing date, decided it was a new novella published independently (as would be deserved, given the track record of the series), and ordered it without checking further.
My bad.
But a reminder to readers who want to buy everything from the series -- be sure to read the description carefully enough to determine whether it is a previously-published-in-a-book-you-already-own item!
I'm thankful that I was able to get this book at the library and didn't spend $15.00 buying it.
I own The Blue Day Book by the same author and I think it's fantastic and it cheers me up right away.
He should have stopped with that book.
It claims to be a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way.
The only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures.
It did have one thought that I really liked: pppppppppp quot;Some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge.
If that's true, then why do smart people dress so badly?
pppppppppp quot
"By a hypnotism that defies explanation--at least by a non-German--Hitler held the allegiance and trust of this remarkable people to the last.
It was inevitable that they would follow him blindly, like dumb cattle but also with a touching faith and even an enthusiasm that raised them above the animal herd, over the precipice to the destruction of the nation."
This remarkable book is based principally on the captured German documents, the interrogations and testimony at the Nuremberg trials of German military officers and civilian officials, the diaries and memoirs which some of them have left, and on Shirer's experience in the Third Reich.
Shirer became one of the most respected journalists in wartime Europe.
The book is exhaustive and detailed with extensive notes and bibliography.
A bit of patience is needed to get through the dialect, often quoting Mein Kampf.
Shirer brings forth wonderful descriptions of the people who played a role in those troubled times.
The individual battles are not detailed, so one will need to refer to other sources for a more detailed look at these battles and horrors that ensued.
This is an important book for those interested in Germany and life in the Third Reich at this time.
The Reich rises with a quick run through of Hitler's youth and the German history, then the politics and Hitler's megalomania that led to national socialism and the rise to dictatorship.
The Treaty of Versais and the fall of the mark lead to Germany's economic fall, allowing for the people to welcome in a dictatorship, a new messiah by deceit.
The military buildup could now begin.
The coups to overthrow Hitler and the Nazis had already failed and will continue to fail throughout the war.
For the officers it was either death by Hitler or death by fighting.
The massacres of the Russians began soon after the invasion of the East.
The French and other countries were also caught up in the massacre, and William gives us the eyewitness reports.
The "Jewish cleansing" started soon after the nazis took over their first countries.
The Nazis kept developing more and more efficient means of extermination and experimentation.
There is an exhaustive lead up to the start of W.W.II, the invasion of Poland.
There was freighting information discovered on what would have been in store for Britain if invaded, not to mention the world and the slaughter of Russia.
The Nazi's pinnacle arrives at about 2/3 of the way through the book where the fall begins with the Allied advance.
It took military action eventually to stop Hitler's "New world order", not the people.
The lack of doing anything to stop Hitler from walking into the Rhineland should not be forgotten.
Does not the blame fall partly on the people, Chamberlain, and the military generals?
Maybe if more would have read Mein Kampf, and not disregarded it's contents millions would not have lost their lives.
The Nazi propaganda took over the press, and soon indoctrinated the German people.
There were many opportunities to stop Hitler by France and Britain early on.
Have we not learned anything from the past?
Is there not a parallel in our country?
"The Germans imposed the Nazi tyranny on themselves."
Hegel was one of the many influences on Hitler and Marx.
Hegel and Marxism is still very much alive today in humanism, nationalism, "supreme state", racism, and mysticism
Don't make the mistake of judging the entire Hard Case Crime series by this lackluster entry.
I can imagine the publishers being overjoyed when Stephen King agreed to write a novel for them and then cringing when they received this manuscript.
The writing is fine, as you'd expect from King, but there's nothing remotely hard-boiled or sexy in this novel.
(Don't let the cover fool you!)
It's simply the meandering story of an apparent murder that happened years before.
There are a couple of interesting hooks, but they certainly don't lead anywhere.
This one's for Stephen King completists only.
This is one of those life changing books.
I first came across this while looking midlessly through my local "spiritual" bookstore and ended up reading the entire thing in the next two hours.
As a fast read, with a simple, concise message, this book lacks nothing.
It isn't dated, unless you consider religion or spiritual ideas dated.
Richard Bach creates a story that can effect you as much or as little as you want- but it teaches the precepts of becoming a messiah yourself and helps you to view Jesus, Christianity, God, and yourself in a brand new light.
Needless to say, this is a five out of five.
Buy it today and then give it away
Totally disappointing.
From the beginning the novel read well, but like a Sherlock Holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue .
I, personally, do not like reading this type of mystery....I want clues.
Alas, there were none.
Also, the characters did not make sense.....most were too undeveloped.....Mr. Patterson needs to go back to the drawing board pppppppppp try to forget the $$$ he is being paid up front by the publisher
There isn't much I can add to previous reviews of Civilziation and Its Discontents.
My own reaction (after 2 cracks at it, one in college, and one post-) is one of bafflement and boredom.
With academic, convoluted language, Freud discusses the role of the individual with his neuroses and his conflicts with socialization and civilization.
Many of his jumbled sociological observations are better recorded by previous thinkers--Rousseau, for example.
His psychological conclusions have more or less been explored at length in his previous works.
Therefore, the redeeming value is found, perhaps, in Freud's closing passages, eery portends of Europe's ugly years
Pamela Jaye Smith has an incredible talent for inspiring writers to dig deep into the core of their characters, which invariably leads them to discovering their own personal nuggets of truth.
She has an encyclopedic knowledge of mythology, spirituality and metaphysics.
Yet her real gift is being able to relate all of this amazing information in an entertaining and clear manner so that it's easy to understand.
The book is very well organized and packed with all kinds of valuable treasures.
I highly recommend it
I am admittedly a terrible cook, so I follow recipes to the letter, often with nonmagical results.
With Julia Child in my kitchen, however, things are looking up!
Her recipe for roast chicken was so exact that even I could not mess it up.
That and the sauteed beef steaks are now my go-to dinners because they are easy and reliable.
I've also had great success with the quiche and biscuit recipes and look forward to trying breadmaking for the first time.
This book is essential for anyone out on his or her own for the first time, newlyweds, or people like me who just don't get it (but really want to)
This is my favorite Jonathan Kellerman novel.
The book focuses on a disturbing story about Munchausen's Disease by Proxy.
This book so quickly caught my interest, that I ended up doing my psych 101 paper on this disease.
I had not heard of this disorder when I read the book.
It was disturbing, intense, and tore away at your heart.
I would definitely recommend this book!
Munchausen's Disease seems to have become a more popular topic since I read this book.
I have seen countless documentaries on, and it was also featured in the newest episode of House.
It is a disturbing, yet intriguing disease, and this book delves straight into the ugliest form of it, Munchausen's Disease by Proxy
I found the book thought-provoking, but there is more to philosophy than provocation.
The common underlying argument of this book, and its only valid statement as ethics, is that since the only purpose of ethics is to regulate human behavior, the ethics society adopts should reflect the kind of society we want to live in.
This results-oriented approach is all very well, but Singer doesn't really build upon it through any legitimate philosophical argument.
Virtually all of Singer's arguments about particular issues rest upon emotional premises that the reader either does or does not accept.
If you accept the premise you are likely to find at least some merit in the argument; if you don't accept the premise, its impossible to follow along to any useful conclusion.
In short, these are not ethical writings but the political writings of someone who is too smart for standard political discourse and not interested in limiting his thoughts to philsophy as a discipline.
How useful you find this is up to you.
I personally don't know Singer from Adam and had not received any prior indoctrination about how groundbreaking he was before I picked up the book; as a result, I have trouble seeing what people are so excited about
I am a Lutheran church librarian and I am glad I bought this very satisfactory book for our church library.
Its text stresses that children are the same the world over.
They have the same feelings and needs, and have the same hopes and dreams.
The illustrations are a nice change from the usual.
Each page is surrounded by a gold picture frame in which faux jewels are embedded.
The illustrations appear to be tempera or opaque watercolor, drawn in Persian style.
The colors are very saturated.
The book's cover gives you an idea of what they look like.
The message of this book is one of diversity--that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities, races, ethnicities, languages or faiths, they still have the same hopes, dreams and daily needs.
This is a very important message for children to hear in today's world where there is so much suspicion of those we "perceive" to be different.
The more children realize that kids are the same everywhere, the more tolerant they will be.
Children pick up prejudice by the time they are three years of age, say researchers, so you have to nip it in the bud very early, and this book does that in a wonderful way.
H.G.
Wells wrote War of the Worlds as a warning to the complacent, world-dominating British citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted.
The arrogance of some British politicians in particular rubbed Wells entirely the wrong way, particularly their sentiment that the British had an 'obligation' to 'civilize' the world (read: colonize) for its own good.
Well's book was a rock thrown at that attitude-on-a-pedestal, and although he didn't knock it down, he made his point- and in spectacular fashion.
In one way, the Martians *were* the conquering British, with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of Africa and other areas colonized by force.
Wells' dark tale was also a warning that even the British- despite their firm belief in their world destiny- could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that didn't give one whit about the British (or anyone else's) false boast of superiority.
In the end, though, it's a hopeful book- just as the Martians died off because they weren't biologically suited to live in this world, Wells also foretells the end of the British Empire because the British (alien) way was not the native way of life in the colonies, suggesting that the British wouldn't survive there long; the natives would eventually prevail.
And they did.
On top of all that, it's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense.
And that's why it's still in print a hundred years later.
-Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstei
My comments are not on the CEV translation, but rather on this particular edition.
Among all low cost editions of the whole Bible (Protestant canon), this one is outstanding in three respects: 1) it has the most extensive annotations (footnotes, introductions and outlines for each book of the Bible, and study helps) of any.
They are not as extensive as many full-fledged study Bibles, of course, but it is a fraction of the price.
2) these annotations appear to have been designed to be solely descriptive, not reflecting any particular theological or scholarly bias.
Thus, this edition can be used by persons with quite a wide range of theological orientations.
3) it has the largest print size.
(Many low cost editions have rather small print.)
so very boring... i gave up halfway in.
i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time.
my sister liked it though.
I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING!
Such filth!
I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up.
But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards.
I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy.
The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes?
In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time!
(Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.)
But Clifford treated Connie poorly.
With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway.
Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick.
A moving story of a family of all boys from New Zealand who have a young sister named Meggie.
They are hardworking lower class people who work the land and shear sheep.
When the family moves to Australia to inherit property, young Meggie becomes bonded to the local Priest from the first day she saw him.
As she grows up, the friendship blossoms into a school girl crush, then a first kiss.
Meggie wants the relationship to go further... but she is not able to get her wish.
Young Meggie is in love and is not able to forget Fr.
Ralph no matter what she does.
She soon moves away from the family homestead by becoming married to Luke O'Neal, a substitute for Fr.
Ralph.
Her marriage to Luke is terrible and she is extremely miserable.
Fr.
Ralph, in a moment of weakness and concern for Meggie's health, comes back into the picture.
He cannot forget the love he had for Meggie either.
Both are not able to say no and their passion overwhelmes them.
The consequences of their act plague them for a lifetime... a remarkable story showing the vunerability, yet obedience to the priesthood
I REALLY enjoyed this book.
I thought the movie incorporated most of the good parts in the book.
There were some character changes and some additional characters in the book, but I don't think they hurt the story line by trimming here and there.
I read the book after seeing the movie - I always wondered what the movie had been based on.
I love baseball, and I think the book was great
Here is a book written for literally anyone who wants to learn lessons for life on how to get rich.
And for all those desperados out there dreaming of getting fantastically rich with ridiculously little effort: here is your guide.
You will learn that making money and getting rich isn't hard at all, but it requires a little discipline.
There are only a handful of tips given in this book, but they are sufficient to make a real difference in your wallet and a real difference in your life!
The style is very easy to understand and very straight-forward.
A child could read this book, even though the setting is that of the ancient city of Babylon, but that makes the story and the lesson all the more interesting.
Five stars are awarded to this book and trust me, you'll agree with me
In "The Year of the Jackpot", a statistician graphs the points of convergence of cyclycal events.
Overlapping his graphs, he notices that the wavy lines are approaching extremes.
Interesting times.
The story "By His Bootstraps" is not logically sound: How did Bob Wilson get to the other side of the Gate so that he could operate the Gate before sending for the first version of himself?
"The Menace From Earth" tackles Earth Moon female jealousy.
"Sky Lift" details the heroism of a rocket pilot carying an antidote to the Pluto colony.
"Goldfish Bowl" asks: What if humans were kept as pets by disinterested intelligent beings?
"Project Nightmare" is about Psionic humans who are able to locate nuclear devices and prevent atomic fusion -- using psi ability.
"Water is for Washing" is about a mega earthquake that creates a new sea between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate.
The Gulf of California extends to Los Angeles
This the one book that taught me more about how to use my SLR than the camera's manual itself.
The step by step approach and the logical arrangement of chapters makes it a book that really teaches you photography.
I also liked the way Mr.
Frost uses two photographs to illustrate a filter.
One take without the filter and then the same one with a filter.
Also explained very well is how longer lenses reduce depth of the photograph and small helful tips on increasing your depth of field.
An encompassing book, the last few chapters tell about how a slide show can be made more interesting and how to take care of your equipment.
The peppering of photos and illustrations make you want to go out and take pictures using the methods shown.
A good buy and money well spent.
My only gripe is that I preffered the smaller size of the previous edition as it fit easily in my kit bag
I read this book and hated it; I was sorry I wasted my money....
Normally, I would have donated the book ater reading it.
But, in this case I was so disappointed, I threw the book away after reading it.
I was disappointed with the author for scrubbing the language so clean that the area she set the book in could have been anywhere in the US.
I was also disapponted in the Oprah book club selection committee.
It seemed to me they found a "story" they liked, and that is where their critical thinking ended.
It was the only and last Oprah book selection I ever bought.
After reading it, it was obvious to me that whoever had chosen the book for the Oprah club had never been to western Pa.
I am from western PA as is O'Dell and this book lacks local color.
She either forgot or choose to ignore that language is also a part of the landscape of a locale.
Landscape is just not about dysfunctional families, EatnParks and religious statues in the yards.... People in that area of PA say "ain't," "slippy," and "youns."
This would be esp.
true for someone like the main character, Harley.
(There are people with college degrees from this area who still have "color" in their language.)
O'dell is no Faulkner or Caufield.
I find this lack of "local flavor" with a lot of modern authors.
Unfortunately, our books are even becoming Mcdonaldized.
There is nothing special about this book
If you are in the computer business, or in sales, you already know the Dell story.
It's about a driven man, Michael Dell, who came up with a simple idea - direct sales - and then expanded his company into the world's second biggest manufacturer of personal computers.
Dell's personal story is inseparable from the story of his company, and his book gives readers his unfiltered, first-person perspective.
He covers his company's history, challenges, problems and successes in an unvarnished, matter-of-fact style.
We highly recommend this book to anyone in the computer industry, to entrepreneurs and to managers who want to make their small businesses grow
Huge disappointment.
Trace wasn't that good either.
Having read all Scarpetta's previous storiesbut I was hoping Trace would be only bad one.
However, the downhill trend seems to continue.
These two books are not the usual intelligent plots Cornwell is capable of writing.
Save your money, don't buy it.
I completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so I won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details
You want to read a horror story?
This is it.
This is the shameful way our government dealt with AIDS in the first six years it appeared in the country- by doing nothing at all.
EVERYONE ignored it.
The CDC, the NIH, the National Cancer Institute, it was ignored by everyone but a handful of scientists and doctors, and they were ignored too.
Over 2000 gay men (and hemophiliacs, and straight people, and babies) died before the government even acknowleged that yes, something new was going around.
Newspapers and media did not report this, because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a "gay disease."
Gay men didn't want to discuss that it "might" be spread through sex, and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of hard-won liberation was unthinkable.
Blood banks wouldn't even ACKNOWLEGE the fact that their products were contaminated, even after it was PROVEN that transfusion AIDS was possible and happening.
By the time President Reagan FIRST uttered the word AIDS, over 25,000 Americans were dead from the disease.
This book made me cry.
The entire way through it, I wanted to scream, I wanted to throw things, I wanted to hit people until they realized that gay people deserve to live too.
A university official that was denying AIDS researchers desperately needed funding had the nerve to actually remark, "Well, at least AIDS is getting rid of a lot of undesirable people."
How absolutely disgusting.
This is a dauntingly large book- 621 pages of reading, all of it frustrating, angering, scream-inducing, and yet, still inspiring.
They didn't give up.
No one threw in the towel until their last breath, or until funding, sufficient funding, was finally granted.
Sadly, the author himself died of AIDS in 1994.
God bless everyone who worked so hard to make AIDS a household word, which finally happened, oh, about SEVEN STINKING YEARS after it first started killing people in the US.
What the heck is wrong with this country?
Why did people have their heads in the sand for so long?
What's so stinking WRONG with us?
Another book everyone should read, if only to know how our government helped spread AIDS around the world by ignoring it for six damn years.
How many people did they kill by doing that?
Far, far too many.
We were the last civilized nation to institute an AIDS education/prevention program.
This book made me dislike the bureaucracy of this country even more, and I didn't think that was possible.
God bless everyone who is working to make life better for people with AIDS
PROS: 1.
John Corey is still a funny, memorable character.
CONS: 1.
Very little suspense.
The author's use of a doomed character's point of view--switching to third person--to tell the reader all of the hows and whys of the main villain's Dr. Evil-esque plan ("FIRE THE NUKE!").
Then, after we know everything, we get plopped back into the first-person, investigative head of Corey, who doesn't yet have the story solved.
The result is predicatable and tedious.
2.
The don't-look-behind-the-curtain (gratuitous?)
use of the Ted Nash character, who makes a brief appearance at the end...despite having died in NIGHTFALL...and, uh, THE LION'S GAME.
Why is Ted's appearance so brief here?
Well, he admits to screwing Ms. Mayfield.
Naturally, Ms. Mayfield opens fire and fills Ted with bullets.
Presumably, Ted's dead for good now.
3.
The politics of DeMille's novels has been present in other books, but it's never been this catty.
Why is the nuke kook a right-winger?
(Hey, why not?)
I should have known when the jacket cover said the book "will challenge you to question everything you thought you knew about your leaders and your country."
The only thing this book has made me question is how anyone can seriously be more worried about conservatives nuking L.A. and San Francisco than the real terrorists out there...the ones who want to slit throats and post the footage on the web.
4.
Continuity problems from how the last book, NIGHTFALL ended...Corey and his wife seem way too disaffected by it all.
Yep, they are bothered by 9/11, but they are both working their same jobs, apparently having gotten over the whole sickening coverup (witnessed via videotape) that the "accident" of the TWA flight 800 was really caused by a missile.
There is passing reference to this, but not much.
Apparently, a guy like Corey doesn't do much soul searching.
He just keeps going to work.
In realilty, it's hard not to notice that DeMille still doesn't know how to deal with the storytelling hole he got himself in with the last book.
Corey is really all this book has going for it.
And, while in his capable hands the world will be saved from kooky nuclear schemes from kooky Republicans, he can't save this book.
I think I'm done with DeMille, for better or for worse
I'm not the expert fencer I long to be (yet), but I do have an ever-growing collection of swords, mostly gifts from grateful Spanish patrons, but I've also been able to purchase and acquire blades from several countries.
The pride of my collection is a fairly well-preserved Roman sword from the reign of Trajan.
Burton was, as we all know, something of a dabbler.
In this book, he offers us not only straight history of the sword, but also countless fascinating bits of sword lore.
I quite frankly can't imagine any sword lover being without this book.
I am looking for a first edition, but for now, this reprint is a valued part of my library
I'll skip the description since that has been done so many times here.
But I would like to say that I don't have much time for reading, so make sure the books I choose are those by authors I consider 5-star.
J.D.
Robb a/k/a Nora Roberts is one of the most prolific authors I've ever read.
How she manages to produce books that remain fresh and vibrant attests to her incredible talent and creative imagination.
I've read this series out of order, but each book is written so that the book itself can stand alone.
This one, however, revealed to me the reason behind Eve's sometimes belligerent attitude, her strong persona, and standoffishness.
Robb is great at revealing subtle conflicts, inner turmoils.
Great book
The author comes off as a whining, unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling' church environment; further apalled by the Church Founder's belief, in that it (the Worlwide Church Of God) was God's True Church through the ages, right on up to the present 'end time'.
Feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on Herbert W. Armstrong,the Church's actual teachings, and a general trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the general denomination as a whole, labeling it a 'cult'...and further damning its Pastor General as a "heretic", despite the Church's humanitarian works, publishing, Colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of H.W.
Armstrong.
Since Armstrong's death in 1986, Feazell and his cohort Joseph Tkach Jr. seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains, and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic Holy Days, sabbaths, ten commandments (which, in his estimation are now the 'ten suggestions') and general lifestyle of this 7th Day Church Of God denomination.
Mr. Feazell apparently does not speak for all the Church membership, as over 100,000 members left and formed various smaller independent Church Of God conferences throughout the United States...and continuing the legacy and apostolic, traditional Christian system of worship restored by Herbert W. Armstrong in 1927.
Recommended reading: "Autobiography of Herbert W. Armstrong"; "Mystery Of The Ages"; "The Incredible Human Potential"
I've used the lonely planet guides on other trips before, and have always been very pleased, but this one left me with a different taste in my mouth.
LP was the only guide we purchased, based on our previous experiences with them, but we had the chance to peruse others in the B pppppppppp B's we stayed in throughout our trip.
Of all of them, I'd rate the LP as the 2nd best for our interests - as they say, individual experiences may vary!
Ireland has become a very expen$ive tourist destination, so upon reflection, we would have been happier with the Rough Guide.
LP has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide, and has ended up short-changing all of them in the process.
I hate to say it, but I'd rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at best.
I'd still put it above most of the other guidebooks though.
Our first and foremost gripe is how out of date the price estimates on everything are.
I realize it was published two years ago, but we gradually learned to depend on everything costing about 20% more than LP listed.
That's quite a jump for 2 years, indicating to me either poor fact-checking for the 2003 edition, or some pretty crazy inflation and a need for another update.
Our second gripe was the local maps.
They failed to provide maps for a lot of the smaller cities, and only provided maps of the city-center areas in the larger ones.
Given the rarity of Irish street signage, those maps would have been a God-send for navigation in towns.
Also, and this may be a function of the 2003 printing, a lot of the towns in Ireland are instituting one-way patterns in their city-centers, and LP's maps rarely identified this.
A third, again related gripe is with the existance, or lack thereof, of the various restaurants, b pppppppppp b's, shops, etc.
listed in the guide.
Probably 30% of the restaurants in the guide just aren't there any more.
I realize they must have been when it went to print, but that didn't help us any.
Our last gripe is the rather uneven coverage of large areas of the country.
Granted, it reflected perfectly the tourist patterns - heavy coverage of larger cities and popular tourist areas along the coasts, pretty awful coverage of less touristed interior areas.
Unfortunately, we didn't just want to go where all the other tourists go, so this left our noses still further out of joint.
Overall, I'd say if you want a guide that covers the sightes well, both LP and Rough Guide do that.
If you want to keep the expenditures down, Rough Guide does it much better.
If you want to go all out, um, there's probably a third option, but neither of these two will do it well.
If you want to be thrifty in some areas and splurge in others, then this guide is the closest you'll get to filling your schizophrenic needs in one place - although, in that case, I'd really recommend getting two guides, one for each end of the spectrum.
One last piece of advice - buy a heritage card when you get to your first castle/tomb/historic place!
If you plan on visiting more than one or two historic places, its 20e cost will be recouped within days with all the free admissions it will get you for the rest of the trip
I fail to understand all of the hoopla about Susan Sontag.
While I have only read a limited selection of her work, in these essays, pppppppppp quot;Against Interpretation pppppppppp quot; being the ultimate example, Sontag emerges as a simple-minded, arrogant ignoramus.
In her utterly unreasoned invective, Sontag ignores (or is just unable to understand) two critical facts.
First, some works of art and theory are difficult to understand (in varying degrees) without the help of interpretation.
Sontag's flawed analysis of the supposed ruination of the works of Kafka by interpretation demonstrates that not only is she among this crowd, she has clearly reached new and unheard of misguided heights.
Second, Sontag ignores the fact that works of art in other languages cannot be understood in translation without the help of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which aspects of a certain culture are imbedded in the original language.
This couldn't possibly be clearer than in poetry.
Weinberger's excellent pppppppppp quot;Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei pppppppppp quot;, which adroitly considers the subject, hadn't been released when Sontag published this essay but it probably wouldn't have made a difference.
What was she thinking?
The only good aspect of the essay (and why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero) is the fact that it has given me ample opportunity to win arguments against individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy Sontag's writing
Someday, I would love to travel to the places that Ann Rule writes about!
As she is so discriptive, I usually feel like I have known these places, and the people she writes about, although...I have never been.
These cases she presents in NO REGRETS, are as REAL to me, as if I'd known them, and felt the sorrow of their loss!
My personal favorite was A Very Bad Christmas..I usually like her Christmas ones, like Black Christmas in Vol.2!
I have always planned to review all her books (of which I own), they are all wonderful, and Amazon has them.
Just buy them, you'll be glad you did
I was at the SFMOMA to see her YES exhibition, and exactly what I expected, I was overwhelmed with delight...
Her art is whimsically amazing.
Her music touches your heart and soul.
Seeing all the people there that day, I was glad that Yoko is finally getting all the respect she deserves, after all these years... Also caught her live performance at the Los Angeles's Roxy almost 6 years ago just took my breath away.
I truly think she's one of the true visionaries of our time
The Big Sky is not just a masterpiece, it's probably THE masterpiece of the genre of western frontier fiction.
This is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that isn't really dealt with that much - the Rocky Mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 - 1850.
The cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature, partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us: the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in "cowboy" movies mirror our own experiences in many ways.
The cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to Americans, when actually nothing was further from the truth.
Cowboys were regular working stiffs, about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day.
They didn't consider themselves "free", nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day.
They did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage, and there was a bit of swagger to it - people in town recognized cow hands for the tough-as-leather men they were, especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had.
But it was backbreaking work, and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years.
I said all that to say that "The Big Sky" really is about freedom, and really is about the West.
It's about the true, wild, primitive west, before the plow, before roads, when there were still huge, intact Indian cultures in place with armies of horsemen and enormous herds of buffalo.
So it's interesting to me that this genre is largely ignored, but I can see why - there are no set-piece plots just begging to be turned into movies - no "new sherriff in town" characters, because there are no sherriffs, and no towns other than a few trading posts.
There is only the land and the sky and the interaction between a few incredibly brave white men and all those Indians.
If you don't already know, this is the story of Boone Caudill and his friend Jim Deakins, and several important side characters, but it's basically Boone's book.
He's driven west by an aching need for wildness and freedom, and is pushed out by a brutal father.
He makes his way west to St. Louis, along the way befriending Deakins, in hopes of meeting his uncle Zeb who had become a trapper years earlier.
The rest of the tail is complex and interlaced, and not a simplistic good guy/bad guy plot at all, and what stands out is the crystalline depictions of the people and places and over all, arching like the sky itself, is freedom.
Freedom to roam at will in that beautiful country is the main character of this book.
Freedom is the religion, the politics, the philosophy, the recreation - it is everything that is important.
The trappers are there to trap - sure - but they're really there because this is a wild, free place, where they will not be hampered by rules, where they can be natural men.
It sounds over romanticized, but it really did happen that way, and from what we know, that is truly the way they felt about their lives and why they endured the agonies of that existence.
Despairing that new settlers are moving west and building farms and towns, Boone cries "Lord, Jim - remember the Tetons standing proud in the sun, and the Seeds Ke Dee...don't you remember her when she was all purty and new and not a man track on her save Injun?"
This novel makes you sob like few I've ever read.
The sense of loss, the closing of an age of the world, hangs in the air like mist.
They are going to be the last to see something so precious, and for their pains they get to watch their world wither and die under the press of settlement.
The movie "The Mountain Men" with Charleton Heston comes close to capturing a tiny bit of this book, and you can tell it's inspired in many ways by it, but no other book or film has ever come close to truly painting the world of the mountain man as has this novel.
"Jeremiah Johnson" is another good film, with many fine touches.
But if you want to follow the water up stream, back to its source in the mountains, then please, before you grow too old, read "The Big Sky" and open your heart to that time and place and the wild, brazen beauty of the America few Americans know ever existed
It has been said time and again that experience is the best teacher.
Antony Flew, the world's number one atheist (at least with respect to the rare ability to argue his point without using ad hominem arguments) has recanted his atheism.
Philosophically, Flew was a rationalist.
Having accepted the empirical evidence of intelligent design in nature, he was able to liberate himself from the tunnel vision of rationalism and hence from the shackles of irrational atheism.
Flew himself would give this book one star.
So, I don't think it ungracious to do the same
Being a student of photojournalizm in Moscow, Russia, I looked for the most complete book on photographic composition that is available.
I had studied one book on the subject by the russian author, but knowing that photography in the US is much more developed and professional I was striving to get a book by a professional photographer.
I was disappointed by the book "Photographic Composition" by Tom Grill for a number of reasons: 1.
It does not cover all important compositional elements, and those that it covers are not explained in full detail.
It does not explain: - how elements with the similar shapes, similar sizes or similar tone interact with each other, - the reverse perspective effect and its uses, - why right and left sides of the photograph differ and why, how it can be used on practice, - how to balance "weight" of different elements of the photograph, it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an incorrect example, - difference between compositional center and the center of interest, how to balance them if they are in different parts of the photo (does not match each other) - all signs of perspective, it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a clear sign of perspective (trivial as it may sound, it still should be marked in any complete work, especially when the author covers other three elements) - and much much more.
2.
It does not use photographs of the best masters to illustrate the topic, neither does it show how composition works in art, which I believe is very important.
3.
Most examples are in color, while most ideas on composition are best explained using B pppppppppp W photographs.
4.
Last but not least, composition is about meaning, making a message, not just how to balance different elements within a frame.
The book makes this statement, but in my opinion fails to provide poverful examples, while you can fully appreciate the power of composition only by studying powerful photos with good explanation why precisely this photo is good.
OVERALL: I believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all important considerations, not just a few and briefly explained "how-to-quickly-improve-any-photo-you-take".
This books fails to provide complete approach to composition and at times can be misleading.
I'd be very grateful if you could recommend me (and other folks that look at our reviews) a more thorough book on composition, I'm sure there must be a good book in english on that subject.
Thanks!
P.S.
For those who can read in russian I advise a book by A. Lapin "Fotografiya kak..", which compared to the book by Tom Grill explains composition in full
_The New Taste of Chocolate_ has the beautiful pictures of a coffee table book, but it has a lot of academic substance and a lot of value to the reader.
The main chapters are: - Growing Up with Cacao - A Natural and Cultural History of Chocolate - From Cacao to Chocolate - Identifying Cacao - Tasting Chocolate - Recipes There is also a glossary, and a list of companies to order fine chocolate from.
For a beginner like myself, who loved chocolate but hadn't progressed much beyond Hershey's with Almonds when I read the book, _The New Taste of Chocolate_ was very educational.
It explained the path from cacao bean to chocolate bar, and it also explained the difference between dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate.
It explained how cocoa powder comes from chocolate, why chocolate is so difficult to make candy with if you don't know what you're doing, and why fancier recipes will sometimes specify chocolate manufacturer and cacao percentage.
It was also quite interesting to read about the guidelines for tasting chocolate.
The discussion about criollo, forastero, and trinitario cacao plants was very fascinating from a scientific standpoint.
I later found that what is true for cacao trees is true for many other types of plants (including wheat): the plants that make the tastiest pppppppppp highest quality edible parts are also the least productive and most delicate, so growers pppppppppp breeders have to choose whether to grow something that will almost certainly produce a less-desired but still profitable crop, or to grow something that has an uncertain yield but is highly profitable should the plant actually produce anything.
The recipes were also interesting.
After reading this book, I became more adventurous in my chocolate-tasting and started trying some of the European imports I see in the local grocery stores.
My only regret is I am now knowledgeable enough and my tastes are spoiled enough that M pppppppppp Ms and Hersheys with Almonds seem pretty bland
This volume contains a lot of valuable information, and is the only work of its kind I am aware of, ie an exhaustive survey of worldwide charismatic Christianity.
That alone earns it four stars.
However, I was disappointed that the editors chose to write from a pro-charismatic bias that may alienate non-charismatics.
Indeed, some of the shorter entries seem more like blurbs for the ministers and movements they represent rather than academic, encyclopaedic introductions.
The problem is not with what information is included so much as what information is *not* included - for example, absent from the entry on Oral Roberts is any mention of the dubious fundraising techniques and outrageous publicity stunts for which he is most (in)famous.
Ian Bilby's entry details his leadership of Elim New Zealand, but includes no mention of the sexual scandal that led to his removal as Elim's NZ leader.
All but the most staggering embarrassments in Pentecostalism's history seem glossed over, as if not offending anyone was a major principle in deciding what to include.
I would expect a scholarly work to reflect both the glory and the shame of this important subject.
This is an annoyance in an otherwise very good work.
Nicely printed and bound - If you like James Allen you'll like this book
I bought this book for my son as a study guide, he is almost finished reading it for the first time, now he says he is going to go back and highlight key information that he will need on his exam.
He is raving about this book, worth the money spent and a very good price
An excellent overall guide for both beginners in weight training and women who are familiar with their local gym!
In this book you will find weekly workout plans laid out clearly for you as well as other lifesyle suggestions to meet your health and fitness/physique goals
I was recommended Borges' works by one of his innumerable over-educated sycophants and I will never forget the tremendous time I wasted attempting to grasp the supposed value of his life's work (when I should have been writing my dissertation).
Each time I read one of his pedantic, mediocre peices of short fiction, I was convinced by these elite book review troglodytes that I would like other examples of his work if I continued reading since pppppppppp quot;all of his stories are so unique.
pppppppppp quot; I found the exact opposite to be true.
One story after another about mazes, mirrors, mystical mathematical formulas and books, books, books.
The ideas were transperant, the language boring in the extreme.
His poetry is trite.
Who needs this?
Borges reads like a petulant graduate student at University of Chicago who failed repeatedly to get his/her short fiction published in _The Atlantic Monthly_.
Particularly among academics, literary elites and like people, many seem to cite Borges and worship his genius more than read him--and certaintly _no one_ reads him critically.
I read most of his work, and I can tell you, outside of a few interesting turns of phrase, you'd be better off reading a Yale dissertation on the semiotics of self-superiority.
People incessantly talk about how imaginative Borges is.
The vast majority of popular SF and fantasy writers are more imaginative.
Even many of the despicable magical realist pppppppppp quot;geniuses pppppppppp quot; make Borges look rather plain.
Borges merely litters his works with elite literary references and a kind of faculty cocktail party wit to make it more palatable to the kind of people who never step foot out of Manhattan or Cambridge.
If you're this kind of pompous fellow, you'll want to sleep every night with a portrait of Luis by your side and a series of mirrors, as it were, slowly attempting to seek some kind of trans-substantiation with this benighted old librarian.
If you're the kind of person who prefers reading about interesting characters, enjoying nuanced use of language, and grasping subtle, daring ideas that transcend purile academic banter, run far, far away from Jorge Luis Borges.
Even top authors from all over the world and every historical period get bad reviews.
The adulation of Borges merely underlines the fact that this is more about a cult of personality among (those who think themselves) intellectual elites than a serious attempt to evaluate his fiction.
I think his fiction is better considered a kind of academic experiment, relegated to quirky local fiction publications and coffee house poetry slams, and not an example of literary genius.
In that sense, 30min spent on one of his short stories gets you the drift of his entire body of work, and that's about as much attention as he deserves
I found this in the church library, but it is not Christian fiction.
It is simply an easy read.
The story is sweet, made even sweeter by the topic.
Cake.
I am not even much of a cake person.
I normally prefer ice cream or some sort of brownies/cookies, etc...
But, as I read, I found myself longing for a bit of these intoxicating concoctions put together by the narrator.
I don't recommend this book if you are diabetic or on a diet.
The need for sweets will be simply overpowering
As an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt, I was very disappointed in Mr. Brands' book.
It appeared to me that Mr. Brands' intent was to analyze the life of this great man strictly from his critic's point of view.
While any good biography worth its salt should present a balanced view of the man, Mr. Brands appears to go out of his way to find fault in almost all of TR's actions.
TR was by no means a perfect man, however, history has proven him to be one of our greatest presidents.
One gets the sense after reading this dreadfully long and depressing account of TR that Mr. Brands'truly disliked his subject
Having read all of McCarthy's other books already, I came into this knowing what to expect as far a style and content.
And I was not disappointed.
McCarthy can better develop a character in two sentences than most authors can in two chapters.
The vivid description of the mountains, the people, and their culture puts the reader right there in the story.
These harsh, terse, and somehow always beautiful images will remain in my mind for a long, long time.
I found this story a little more abstract than most of McCarthy's other works, yet I was able to see his message in the end.
Required reading for any McCarthy fan
This play explores the same old turf as "Death of a Salesman", but it does so with much less satisfaction and much less character development.
Eddie is no Willy Loman, though, and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a central, driving force like Willy.
Parts of the play seem borrowed from Tennessee Williams, and they don't seem to work in this context.
There is some business about the romance of the Old World Italy versus the New World of Opportunity on the docks of New York, and it is the only topic that is at all explored well, if still unsatisfactorily.
Eddie's dreams are represented in his pretty niece, Catherine; and unlike Willy Loman's uncle, she is still an attainable dream.
That makes Eddie's life seem all the more petty, in comparison to Willy's: he longs wearily not after what he could have had, but after what he can never have, as he is already married.
The death scene at the end of the play also seems like a forced, tacked on ending, and Alfieri's entire presence is a more or less unsuccessful stage gimmick.
There are better plays by Miller, and many better plays by others
It would take a book to answer all that is wrong with Farrell's reasoning, but to make a few points: 1.
He implies that female 'circumcision' is much the same as male circumcision which is astounding but points to his general ignorance.
If male circumcision is about teaching males to endure pain (actually more about male tribal bonding) then what on earth is a little girl being taught when she has her external genitalia cut away and is left with a tiny hole and a life-time of pain and health problems??
It's for protection?
What, or whose, interests are being protected?
2.
He does not acknowledge that the shorter male life-span is due to testosterone and all its consequences for males.
Castration is known to increase the male life-span.
Why do men even want more testosterone rather than less?
Surely illogical?
3.
The male 'instinct' to protect females is actually to protect the bodies men need for sex and reproduction.
As more than 50 million females have been killed recently in Asia simply because they were female should make us question this supposed 'instinct to protect'.
And protecting females most often translates into ownership and control.
This is a similar logic to that of men in certain cultures that use the pretext of honor to justify the murder of females.
Why do women need protection form their protectors?
Men need to explain their logic here.
Is it something like the protection criminal gangs provide for people against other criminal gangs?
4.
Powerless men are created by male-male competition for access to young females and again, the sacred testosterone drives this not women.
5.
His views on rape are ridiculous.
Young human females have permanent sexual signals whether they want sex or not.
These external signals do not usually reflect the females internal desires and concerns and this causes the confusion.
Men are responding to fake signals that females don't know how to override without becoming invisible altogether.
6.
This book is basically about all the hoops males try and jump through in order to rise in the male hierarchy and ultimately get their DNA into numbers of females.The men who fail are the men without power.
Farrell wants us to feel sorry for them which is as likely as men feeling sorry for, and diverting their monogamous sexual interest and resources towards, unnattractive old women.
7.Farrell does not explain the irrationality of men rejecting and being abusive about women who don't sexually reject most men (ie the easy women) at the same time as they complain about the pain of being sexually rejected so often by women.
There must be some mysterious male logic to it - perhaps situated in a fantasy world of being the only male who isn't rejected.
Duplicity is clearly a male trait that farrell failed to mention.
8.
It is a suspect logic that concludes that the people who have been the lawmakers and political leaders for millennia ie males, have actually only been acting in the self-interest of females.
For men to have evolved a lack of self-interest is impossible.
To argue that they have is Farrell's most ludicrous argument.
Of course women also have self-interest, intimately tied to that of their children.
The very real difference is that because we evolved with a mating system where females moved to male-bonded kin groups to breed males had the advantages of size, kin-bonding, no real reproductive demands of offspring and time and cicumstances that enabled them to be the rule-makers which included the enforcement of ownership and control of females as they were exchanged between groups for breeding.
They may have felt varying amounts of power within that system and they may have felt the power of their sex needs as female power but to say that this is actually women having and exercising power is absurdly illogical and contrary to reality.
It is another fantasy to add to that of South Sea Island free sex and mermaids.
This book is interesting for debate and as an example of male sexual frustration being blamed on women.
Ultimately it is about how some men suffer trying to get sexual/reproductive access to females and might help us notice that the 'power' being defined is reproduction.
In a market where the supply of sperm far outstrips the tiny market of eggs it does reduce the value of sperm and create massive competition in males and competition in females for better quality sperm and/or extras that improve the outcome for offspring.
Embedded in Farrell's books is the manipulative attempt to solve this by encouraging young women to 'put out' more.
It's the same old male longing for 'free' sex ie the usual reproductive behavior of male animals where post-copulatory costs are carried by females.
In nature male animals experience far less or equal disposability as females when they are monogamous and concentrate more on parenting ie are symmetrical with female reproductive behavior.
Can we look forward to this in the human male in the near future and solve the whole problem?
Can we expect men might consider reducing the supply ie their sex-drive/seeking multiple partners and increasing their childcare.
Reduce testosterone?
Or is that blasphemy?
The new question is What do men want?
The answer is the same as ever - sex.
The methods of trying to get it are the same even when put in a new wrapper such as Farrell's ie irrationality, deceit and manipulation.
Perhaps the real myth is the myth of ADULT power and we should direct our anger and frustration towards our gametes, hormones, fetuses, infants and children that are the real reason males and females exist, are pulled together and driven apart.
At least let's not create a new myth that the human male somehow managed to evolve a lack of self-interest.
How gullible does Farrell hope we are
I was very disapointed by this book.
After just finishing the 400+ pages book "Bull!
from Maggie Mahar" which is an absolute ecxellent book about market cycles (although the more recent boom of 1982-1999), "The great Crash" was really hard to read.
It totally shows its age (it was written more than 50 years ago).
The language is hard to understand and some words seem weird in todays time.
But its not just the language which makes this book not enjoyable.
It is not written with much entertainment value, and the book I mentioned earlier shows clearly that it is quite possible to write an very entertaining book about the stock market.
It also is very superficial, it doesn't go into much detail at all.
It doesn't tell any examples of real people or anything which would make the book more readable.
It lists names and companies without doing a good part of explaning why it lists them.
Sometimes I was thinking to myself "Please get to your point."
That book was probably a good read in 1955 while people still could relate to most of the names he lists.
But now (2004) there must be better books out there about the Crash of 1929.
I give it two stars and not one (you can't give zero stars) because it has some interesting facts.
Overall I would NOT recommend this book.
Try another one about this subject
This is a liberal's study bible.
The study notes show the best 'modern' scholarship, which doubts Moses wrote the first 5 books of the bible.
Doubts the authorship of most of Paul's Epistles.
Even doubts that the beloved disciple John wrote the Gospel of John.
Believes Redactionary Interpretive Theory is valid.
Falls right in line with most modern and so called 'higher' critisim of the Bible.
Avoid this study bible, if you believe the Bible is really God's word from cover to cover
Are you ready to become a "home gamer."
Are you seriously looking to improve your current results in the stock market?
Do you have a moderate level of knowledge about the stock market and our economic system?
Are you equally concerned with preserving your capital while earning a better-than-average return?
Do you prefer a system that incorporates probability and statistics as a tool to assess risk?
Are you a believer in using fundamental analysis AND technical analysis in choosing growth stocks as your preferred investment?
Do you have adequate time and interest to devote to actively managing your portfolio?
If your answers to these questions (especially the final one) are "yes" then buying this classic might be the best 10 bucks you ever spent.
This little gem is chock-full of information and practical advice garnered over 50 years of investment experience, coupled with an acute observation of human nature at work in the market
Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that "Three Junes" was listed as a popular book choice.
The title sounded interesting so I bought it.
That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition.
It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline.
I will finish the book because that's my style.
It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to.
As I've said before NATIONAL HYPNOSIS!!!
Liberals want to dupe the masses into believing that modern Conservatism and Lberalism are different ideologies (they both come from Hegel and Machiavelli the philosophies that gave birth to Communism and Facism).
I must admit I usually write only positive reviews as I buy books very carefully.
This is unfortunately a wrong buy.
I like the Shabby Chic style and since she's the person to get inspiration from on this style, I immediately bought this book without hesitation.
I must say I wasn't inspired at all not even on one item and I am usually quite easily inspired by just reading a mag, browsing through ebay or simply walking around the market.
The pics are big but on flowers??
I think I should've got the first book instead
Narrated through the heartfelt voice of Amy Tan, the Kitchen God's Wife illustrates a compelling story of heritage and self-discovery.
As a young Chinese woman, Winnie Louie, the main character and the conduit through which Tan expresses her voice, must endure an atrocious life under the abuse and torture of her wicked husband Wen Fu, a pretentious, arrogant, and egregious man who not only cheated his way up the military ladder, but also committed numerous felons including rape, murder, blackmailing, and extortion.
Day after day, beating after beating, Winnie slowly begins to realize that in order to escape from Wen Fu and start a new life free from violence and marked by love, radical and immediate actions must be taken.
When dealing with someone without even a modicum of human decency, someone like Wen Fu, the usual, traditional, and orthodox actions are futile.
Striking a perfect chord between concision and elaboration, Tan keeps the reader constantly engaged as the dramatic story of Winnie unfolds itself.
Relying mostly on authentic voice and keeping the meretricious elements to a minimum, Tan narrates the novel with surprising precision and unmatched beauty.
Against the magnificent backdrops of a WWII-era China, the novel reassures the universal nature of mankind, that the problems troubling people today are experienced by all generations, regardless of race, nationality, or social status.
As you read this rare gem amount literature, open the introspective window and enjoy the novel with your heart.
I didn't find the book too bad but it has no ending.
Did he leave out the last chapter?
I have always liked his books so hopefully he's got this out of his system
Got this book for my oldest daughter about a week ago and she reports the binding is very bad.
Pages are falling out
This is one of the worst books ever, don't buy it
This is truly a disappointing book.
It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.
Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.
The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.
She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.
I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.
Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.
Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.
Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.
In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.
I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.
Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.
That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.
The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.
It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.
His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).
This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.
Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.
Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts
Quite often, we read books for young people where the main characters must lean to care for others and not just themselves-where the main character must break away from childhood egocentrism and emerge into the adult world.
In Katherine Paterson's Lyddie, readers find the opposite theme: Learning to not lose oneself in the responsibilities of the adult world.
The novel follows Lydia Worthen, a teenager in 1840s Vermont.
With her father gone to seek his fortune, Lyddie, with some help from her brother Charlie, must take charge of the family farm, her emotionally unstable mother, and her younger sisters.
To cover the farm debt, Lyddie's mother leases the farm and sends her oldest children into forced servitude.
After a year of misery working for a local tavern, Lyddie becomes a mill hand in Lowell, Massachusetts.
While there, Lyddie's sole focus becomes earning the money to pay off the farm debt and reunite her family.
Her hard work and single-mindedness earn her a reputation as a "skinflint" and "Amazon."
It's only after the farm is sold, her youngest sister dies, her mother is sent to the asylum, her remaining siblings are adopted by another family, and her job is lost over fraudulent charges that Lyddie begins to look out for herself-that she begins to ask what she wants for herself.
While Lyddie is not Paterson's best work, the book does provide lively insight to factory life in Lowell, where many young women flocked in the early 1840s for economic opportunity.
While readers are not thrown into the heart of the labor movement, we are able to see the conditions that led to organized labor: The long hours, the sexual harassment, the illness and disease resulting from mill work.
Still, all of this background provides a fitting setting for the story of a young woman who must learn that she has more to offer the world than her back-breaking labor.
If you've enjoyed Paterson's other works of historical fiction, Lyddie will not disappoint.
Design is a difficult process that is often associated more with art than science.
With principles of style, concerns about how design works.
While many wring their hands about this, Alexander breaks the problem down, organizes it and then provides a framework for design that is relatively design neutral.
That is a feat in deed.
By thinking about how one structures a problem space and the bias that creates -- Alexander give the practioner a powerful tool for setting up the design process and scope.
He then goes on to discuss the design process and he makes important distinctions between concious and unconcious design.
Notes on Synthesis and Form are the foundation for Alexander's work on design patterns.
This is the must read book before spending time on these other works.
For the practioner, this book provides a powerful and applicable framework for addressing problems in multiple disciplines.
The book is manipulative and unrealistic.
I felt the author was blatantly trying to persuade the reader to believe that infieldey, betrayal and lack of morals is acceptable if you have a self absorbed best friend.
Definitely one of the shallowest books I have ever read.
I bought the book as it was rated as a "best seller" , and I was stuck in an airport for hours on end.
The entire plot is hideous as the "burned best friend" makes up reasons why it's accept able to betray her best friend.
If I was not completely bored, I would have given up on the book after the first 20 pages.
