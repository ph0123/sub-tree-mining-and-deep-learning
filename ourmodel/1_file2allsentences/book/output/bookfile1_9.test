This is an excellent book.
The anecdotal stories that the author includes make the book much more readable when compared to other parrot guides.
The authors book on Senegal parrots and their family is also full of information.
The whole concept of this book as well as the honesty of the undertaking: I'm not buying it.
The author's effort is half-a**ed at best.
Besides the musings and excessive self-praise, it is downright preachy.
Their effort might pass as non-consumerism for New Yorkers, but would never pass in the rest of America.
Don't buy it
I found this book sadly lacking in substance and quality activities.
Spend your money on Days of Knights and Damsels by Carlson
Let me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.
The reviews I've read are all true.
This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.
The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.
I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.
She has not published a good book in a long time.
I also think that she's lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn't let books like this be printed.
This story pretty much follows stories she's done before except it's told from the guy's point of view.
There's the rich guy, Charlie, who can't seem to find the "perfect" girl to marry.
He finds a flaw with every one he dates.
He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.
So of course he's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.
Then there's rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.
It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.
He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.
His parents blame him for the divorce.
Every time he visits them, his mother let's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.
The last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.
He has no desire to ever marry or date.
The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie's yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don't want commitments.
Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.
Same old story.
Danielle Steel should stop writing.
You can't tell me she doesn't have enough money to live on.
I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won't even bother renting them from the library.
I won't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.
There are better authors available and I'm going to read them
Galbraith's insight on society unfortunately gets lost in a maze of double negatives and confusing sentence structure.
His ideas are sound, though he has a very off-putting pompous delivery.
In fact, his verbosity and poor structure is so bad, that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind-numbing experience.
The book really needs to go back to an editor
In this study Demos examines family life as it was for the Pilgrims who came over on the Mayflower, before they joined with the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
The book is in three main sections: the physical setting (housing, furnishings, and clothing); the structure of the household (family connections, including servants); and individual development (childhood, coming of age, and old age).
The most striking thing is how all aspects of communal life were controlled by the Court: although laws were not draconian, they spelled out how one was to conduct his or her life pretty thoroughly.
Mess up and you would be punished.
But it's also true that people were not that different back then, either: parents still cared for their children and worried about their futures by making provisions for them; families were at the core of society's welfare; even women were given rights denied them in the mother country.
It's interesting that even these first settlers saw the American continent as a vast area just waiting to be colonized, and one of the biggest problems facing the authorities was how to keep settlers from wanting to spread out too far from Plymouth itself, thus weakening communal ties.
A highly recommended book
This book just rambles on and on and never seems to end.
I don't think I have ever been so disappointed in a book.
Since I started to read it, I feel like I have to finish it.
I am just praying for that day to come soon.
I have to skip over entire paragraphs just to get through a chapter.
It is overwhelming proof that hippies should NEVER write books
This is truely a funny book.
It of course is the origin of the Ma and Pa Kettle movies, yet much more.
I like to pull this one off the shelf every now and again just to be able to chuckle.
When you read it, you must remember when it was written and what the racial and political attitudes of the time were, although, it is a good read on that level too, i.e.
seeing were our culture has been and where it is today.
I did read one or two reviews which compaired this work to some of the authors other work...good grief folks, lighten up..read the thing for what it is..a funny story meant to amuse.
When I was a kid, I did not read Micky Mouse and analyze each comic book for political correctness, nor social commentary (although, being a dog lover, I was not always happy how Pluto was presented and treated) nor did I compair the Micky of 1949 to the Micky of 1952.
Anyway, digging into a book like this for those reasons is fine I suppose, if you are into such, but for me, I just enjoyed the read and highly recommend it
Sabuda is my all-time favorite pop-up maker!
His stuff is so fabulous and intricate, it'll just blow you away
Though you may not immediately think that there is a connection between language and the places where you live and pass through, your sense of your surroundings and of language itself will be transformed after you read Gaston Bachelard's pppppppppp quot;The Poetics of Space.
pppppppppp quot; Bachelard argues that language--especially poetry--can reveal hidden aspects of our experience of space, especially of our home space.
For example, he considers how common phrases such as pppppppppp quot;go up to the attic pppppppppp quot; and pppppppppp quot;go down to the basement pppppppppp quot; are revelatory of our typical sense that stairs to an attic are stairs one ascends, while stairs to the basement are stairs one descends--in spite of the fact that both sets of stairs must be equally ascended and descended.
As he does with other such observations, Bachelard extends his observation regarding the directionality of different staircases into a discussion of how the attic and basement hold different roles in our daily and imaginary lives.
In addition to exploring how we experience space and place, Bachelard equally attends to the way in which language can function either as a daily and common means of communication or as a site of new and creative insight; roughly speaking, he argues that poetry happens when the motions of language itself open us up to a new way of seeing or understanding something.
By reading this beautifully written and engaging book, you will likely come to understand or see anew experiences from childhood through adulthood that pertain to places where your have lived, grown up, felt comfortable or alienated, had a feeling of wonder or fear, etc.
I recommend this book to anyone interested in the experience of place or space, in language and what it can reveal to us, or in what counts as poetry rather than as common everyday language
I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.
I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.
Is there really such a thing as pppppppppp quot;national character pppppppppp quot;?
People are just too different, too unpredictable.
How well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you ?
How well can you predict what people in your own country will do ?
Would every Italian, if they could write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?
I seriously doubt it.
So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million Italians.
After reading it, I felt even more strongly that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.
An informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?
Anthropologists have been concerned, for many years, in getting the pppppppppp quot;inside view pppppppppp quot;--the view of a culture as seen by the person within it.
While Barzini is indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.
This is not a successful gambit.
Cultures are based on many general factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family, etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.
Barzini covers many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by foreigners.
But nothing really connects.
There are only superficial, scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.
The reader is left with a handful of stereotypes.
Barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.
These sections were well-written and interesting.
But his portrayal of Italian pppppppppp quot;character pppppppppp quot; is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately, unconvincing.
Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.
Myself, I got pretty tired of those lists.
If you want to know something useful about Italy, read another book.
If you just want entertainment, which might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could be for you
The hero is a cold,mean brute who does not deserve his gentle wife Kassia.He should have been made to marry Joanna the shrewish woman he was betrothed to.I couldn't get past Graelam raping Kassia,I really couldn't.I know this is medieval England and women were more or less treated like chattel,but come on.Kassia is a gentle sweet girl who does everything to please this philandering,brute of a man.He sleeps with one of the servants after he marries Kassia, when she confronts him he threatens to beat and rape her which he had already done(I shuddered again right there).There's not one but two women undermining Kassia's authority and she sits back and takes this,please!The servants and his own soldiers abhor his treatment of Kassia throughout the book.I prayed for her to runaway with Dienwald or for Guy to fall in love with her and take her away from Graelam.The women who made Kassialife hell were rewarded for their treatment of her,they are never made to pay for what they did to her which is another thing that put me off this book.I like to see the heroine giving as good as she gets even if she's not a particularly strong character.Kassia was far too soft and gentle for this brute as a result he walked all over her quite literally.I wanted him to really suffer for his treatment of her which he didn't,this is why I bothered to finish this book for him to get his comeuppance which hedidn't.She capitulated far too easily in the end when he came to get her at her father's castle.I know that he's a warrior but didn't knights have a chivalric code
I agree with the first reviewer: this is what art criticism, politically engaged or not, should read like.
Berger was an old-time Marxist; I am an Anglosphere conservative.
He is a man of the Left; I am of the Right.
No matter, his essays are the most wonderful introduction to art criticism, and at times philosophy, that I have read.
Incredibly perceptive, sensitive, without empty sentimentality but filled with genuine sentiment and deep empathy for the human condition, Berger can make any painting or work of art say more than even its author may have intended.
He uses history but is not a historicist, for he lets the works reveal themselves openly.
The essay "That which is held," a philosophic vindication of romantic love through an analysis of "time" is a near masterpiece of the essay form worthy of Montaigne.
Berger will be missed in the barren landscape of contemporary Europe.
Danto and the Americans are simply not in his league
When my sunday school teacher gave us the challenge of reading through the Bible in a year, I thought it was going to be hard.
So I started looking for a one-year Bible.
When I came across this one I was really excited.
It is by far my favorite traslation because it is so easy to read.
I can get through the daily reading in about 15-20 minutes.
It breaks down the hard to read old testament into easy reading.
And one of the best parts is that it breaks down the reading by day, so you are not constantly going back and forth between the books.
Truely one of the best Bibles I have purchased!!
!
I love historical fiction, and The March was one of the better historical novels that I've read.
The characters are well-drawn, and the action moves along briskly, with no dead spots.
The civil war background seemed very authentic, and unlike many similar historical novels that focus on the military actions or the civilian actions, The March blends the two to show that war really is hell.
Doctorow is an excellent writer, and he obviously did a lot of period research to make the background so believable.
My only objection was his implication that the civil war was only about slavery and that Union soldiers fought solely because of the slavery issue.
That's not true, as studies of Union soldiers' letters and diaries have demonstrated that most soldiers fought out of patriotism or to join with other family members, or for other reasons than just slavery.
That also applies to Confederate soldiers.
A minor quibble that doesn't really hurt the book, but it does discredit the author for not sticking to real, documented historical fact.
Highly recommended
This book is a wonderful all-color rendition which has important factual information on the tallest man, the tripling of the population in the past half century and the spectacular Olympus Mons on the Marsian surface- just to mention a few of the many features contained.
The book is perfect for student projects in science and the arts.
It well worth the price charged
This book has a photo of each dessert so you can see what you're making and easy recipes that look impressive, all using a cake mix box of some kind.
Their Snickerdoodle Cake uses a white cake mix, some other ingredients, and includes a Cinnamon Buttercream frosting recipe.
Yum!
I love the variety of recipes (bundts, bars, round, layered, etc.)
and my kids and I can do many together.
I think the packaged cake mixes from the store have a nice taste, so these recipes just build on those mixes.
I just want easy recipes that aren't intimidating, and this book is the solution for that.
I highly reccommend The Cake Mix Doctor.
A much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story.
The end was a disappointment and the middle laborious
Many reviewers of this book have given it high marks because it is a terrific tutorial and that introduces most of the crucial techniques for writing great reports.
I would agree as I have reporting experience with MS-Access and Crystal and this book helped me get up to speed quickly.
If you like learning in a step-by-step fashion right out of a book - this is the book!
The bad reviews came from people that were looking for more of a reference type book.
While this book is not a bad reference it does fall short as a reference book.
For example, one reviewer brought up that the ability to shade alternating detail rows of a report does not appear to be easy to find in this book.
I would agree with that.
I was unable to go into the index and find a quick solution in this book.
If you want a better reference book try the WROX book, Professional SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services.
That book is not as good as this book from a step-by-step standpoint but it is a better reference when you need a quick solutions.
For example, page 272 has code on how to shade alternating rows - they call it Greenbar Reports.
It was not easy to find in this book either.
How many people would look up "Greenbar Reports" in the reference?
I was looking into "shading alternative rows".
I just happened to stumble upon it.
I bought both books together.
Of course there is lots of overlap but between the two that is all you will need to become a pro at Reporting Services.
Reporting Services could use a COOKBOOK-style text like they have for Access and other programming languages.
Those types of books have served me well over the years.
Until then this book and the WROX book should do the trick
Dale Carnegie is one of the authors I have admired for so long.
There are numerous reasons why this book is a classic one.
He deeply believes that in every person there is good and you can approach it.
Of course, there are many negative people who don't like this book because they see everything in black and white.
Carnegie on the other side advocates a really delicate, positive and humane approach to everyone around you.
It comes very close to "treat the others as you want them to treat you".
I am sure that if everyone read and apply the principles in this wonderful book, the world will be a better place.
I am sure that you will be pleased as well with his talent to really understand what drives people.
Some of the key and basic motivators he discussed are sex and being important.
His viewpoint is very close to the one of the bestselling author of scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex.
After all genius things are usually simple.
Carnegie explores the human nature and common hot buttons together with the reader and gives you tools to manage and push them at your will with the help of numerous examples.
I liked that the book is practical, easy and fun to read, and most of all that it delivers great value.
I can not say the same for many other books.
Definitely get a copy especially if you are a "good" person and prefer to treat people with respect and dignity
I am an inveterate map reader.
Whenever I travel there is a map in my pocket.
But a recent trip to the Middle East and growing hobby collecting ancient coins had left me lost and confused as I tried to put in context the ruins visited and the coins I collected.
With time, the names of cities and regions change so that one needs a separate map for each period.
Morkot's superbly written historical atlas not only provides maps, but the rationale and context for their evolution and change.
One of the best features in the structure of this book is the use of the overview, followed by a series of in-depth accounts, each from the perspective of the important pppppppppp quot;players pppppppppp quot; during a given historical period.
This approach is immensely effective in reinforcing the information since the same information is repeated and new information added as each of the regions, their politics and battles, are succesively presented.
From the Mycenae to the Parthians are thousands of years, thousands of miles, and thousands of political entities whose ebb and flow of power and reach of influence affect us even today.
For the first time after years of puzzling over strange Grecian place names and leaders, I am now able to begin to understand the who what when and where for the 5 millenia preceding the birth of Christ.
I wish this had been the first book I read in my study of ancient history.
I can hardly wait to start on Penguin's sequel - Acient Rome
I listened to this as an audiobook.
This is the worst book I've ever listened to from Audible.
The worst.
The narration is just too, too cutesy sweet and the writing is junior high quality at best.
Unfortunately, I keep hearing Emperor Franz Josef in Amadeus saying, "It has, well, too many notes."
Barr describes everything (including clothes, hair, shoes, etc) with multiple metaphors, a plethora of adjectives, and, well, too many notes.
I kept yelling at the author to just shut up and tell the story.
I tried three times to listen to it and just wanted to scream after 10 minutes.
I've heard this woman read other books and quite liked them, but her voice and this story just don't add up to anything other than ear pain and a case of diabetes.
Where's Michael Connelly when you need him
I got this book for my fiance on the recommendation of my Rabbi.
She loves it.
This book is rather different.
Although it's about Copernicus' book "De Revolutionibus", very little astronomy is discussed.
There is also very little about Copernicus himself.
The main theme of the book is finding as many still-existing copies of Copernicus' book as possible, and describing each one in detail - the ultimate purpose being the publication of a so-called "census" of that ancient book, i.e., a snapshot in time that identifies and describes each individual copy and where it is located in the world.
Since I know nothing about antique book collecting, I learned a lot on this field by reading this book.
I was not aware of all the work and travel required in finding a given copy of a book, especially identifying the authors of any hand-written notes on its pages.
I did find certain lengthy descriptions rather monotonous, but some of the author's adventures are quite intriguing, particularly where he makes use of his notes to identify possibly stolen copies that eventually surface at auctions or elsewhere.
Some aspects of life and technology in the sixteenth century that are important for the theme of this book, as well as discussions of some of Copernicus' contemporaries, are touched upon.
But as the author states, this book is really a memoir of his census project.
I think that this book would be of most interest to those with a passion for ancient books and ancient book collecting.
I'm a huge Suz fan ... but I really think she missed the boat on this one.
Her style has changed since she moved to hardcover pppppppppp this book just fell flat for me.
The secondary storyline or FBI agent Jules was much more enjoyable than the lead couple Cosmo pppppppppp Jane.
Didn't like her at all pppppppppp Cosmo lost his "Seal-ness" somewhere along the way.
Not a re-read for me
Stephen King has made another novel full of horror and suspense.
The biggest storm ever is about to hit a town called Little Tall Island in Maine.
While this storm is occuring a strange gentleman named Andre Linoge stops to visit.
He walks up to a home owned by an old woman Martha Clarendon.
Linoge charges in the old womans home and brutily murders her.
Later, he purposly lets the police department arrest him
Great book, of course, but for this edition Oxford used a computer to justify the type.
On every other line you encounter three or four spaces where there should be only one.
It may not bother most readers, but I'm looking for another publisher's edition
From the beginning, Roberto was different.
He loved his wood, but he'd always rather play with his food than eat it.
More than anything he wanted to become a famous architect like his heroes, Hank Floyd Mite and Fleas Van Der Rohe.
Belittled at home by the other termites and never taken seriously, Roberto sets off for the big city to pppppppppp quot;build his dreams.
pppppppppp quot; Life in the city is hard, and not just for Roberto.
He meets all kinds of bugs with housing problems, including roaches chased from a diner, a housefly with no place to go and a poor ladybug whose house is on fire and children are gone.
Marshalling all his determination, Roberto decides to build a new community, that will meet the needs of these out-of-luck bugs and maybe make his architect dreams come true at the same time..... Nina Laden has written and illustrated a delightful and amusing story with a most improbable hero and youngsters will be rooting for Roberto as he chases and finally realizes his heart's desire, in his bug eat bug world.
Ms Laden's witty text, full of creative wordplay, will charm adults as well as children and her outstanding collage artwork, so full of wonderful detail, really brings this story to life.
A terrific picture book for youngsters 4-8, Roberto the Insect Architect lets everyone know that with hard work, your dreams can come true
This story captivated me right from the outset, as Vivian copes with age-related loss of memory.
Her scenes are tenderly drawn in sensitively described and insightful detail, and she is a very realistically portrayed.
As Susannah packs up her childhood home and prepares to move Vivian into an assisted living apartment, she uncovers clues to her past concerning the mysteries of her brother's death and whereabouts of her long-lost high-school sweetheart.
With just the right blend of drama, action, suspense and resolution of family issues, this enjoyable story is very uplifting and thought-provoking, providing reflections for my own midlife crisises.
It is easily read within a couple of hours, and there is a subtle tie-in to the Blossom Street books, leaving the possibility that these likable characters may reappear in subsequent books in that series.
"A Dirty Job" was my first Christopher Moore novel, and will probably be my last.
I was captivated by the story line as I read the dust jacket, but found that the writing was not nearly as interesting.
I thought the author spent way too many pages with humdrum matters of no real interest, and very little addressing the actual theme of the book.
Although wanting to relate sympathetically to the book's hero, I just wasn't drawn in enough to care about him.
The action began in the final quarter of the book, and you had better suspend reality before reading it.
I actually couldn't wait for the book to end so I could move on to something more interesting
I admire an author who deviates from a standard formula and the interweaving of two cases really works in "Piece of My Heart."
DI Stanley Chadwick faces a murder case in 1969 against the backdrop of a rock 'n roll concert.
His teenage daughter has facts to hide and DI Chadwick walks a fine line.
DCI Alan Banks is seeking a murderer in 2005 which eventually connects with the 1969 murder.
The plot has already been outlined, so I'll just say it's a delight to visit DCI Banks again.
I'm never disappointed
If you have ever needed to change a part on your bike, upgrade to something better, change out your drivetrain, tune your derailleur's, or even true a wheel... this is the book for you!
With awesome in depth pictures, and step by step technical procedures for doing just about anything to the bike that you so dearly love.
John Barnett's experience with bike repairs far surpasses that of the guy that you normally bring it into for those expensive repairs, so spend the money for the book, and save money in the future while at the same time learning from one of the top professionals in his business!
Do it, it's an awesome book
What a disastrously bad and unfunny novel.
The self-involved main character is pathetic and whiny, the "plot" is see-through and cliched, and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog.
When people criticize chick lit, this is exactly the kind of book they're talking about.
It's shallow to such a shocking degree than when it tries to take itself seriously, or stretches for a literary flourish, it's absolutely cringe-worthy.
I find it hard to believe the people who've praised it here actually read the same book.
This was given to me by an acquaintance shortly after my engagement.
She said she didn't really like it but thought it would be "more my kind of thing."
Obviously not a person who knows me well.
Thankfully, it doesn't appear the author is terribly prolific, so readers don't need to worry about trying to stumble through page after page of show-offy navel-gazing.
I wouldn't say it's one of the worst books I've read, but it's certainly one of the most useless
"OF PARADISE AND POWER" - BY ROBERT KAGAN "Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus" - apart from simply raising a few eyebrows, this line by Robert Kagan author of "Of Paradise And Power", has not only caught the attention of many but managed to stir up a wave of discussions among the politicians and elites concerned with cross-Atlantic relations.
Kagan's thought provoking book became extremely popular and received international acclaim for its analysis of the deteriorating US-Europe relationship, not to mention its catchy and striking phrases systematically introduced throughout the slender yet captivating book.
Kagan introduces multiple chapters in his book, in order to deconstruct the key underlying issues which he claims are causes of the ever widening divide between US and Europe.
In the chapter "The Power Gap", Kagan starts from World War I to understand the aversiveness Europe displays towards military and wars.
He argues that while both the World Wars weakened Europe tremendously; they helped the US emerge as a super power.
He further elaborates on the might of the US in the chapter that follows - "Psychologies of Power and Weakness".
Kagan explains how lack of power can not only affect psychologies and ideologies, but change perspectives as well.
He claims Europe's paucity of military power compels it to not only tolerate threats but ignore them all together and at the same time try and counterbalance the US force by constructing a world which is governed by economic and soft non-violent methods.
This chapter culminates into "Hyperpussiance", a chapter in which Kagan discusses intricate details of Kosovo and Bosnia, highlighting Europe's failure and America's effectiveness in handling the situation.
He finally presents his central argument in the chapters "The Post Modern Paradise" and "The World America Made" where Kagan states, "Europe's evolution into its present state occurred under the mantle of the U.S. security guarantee and could not have occurred without it."
Casting doubts on Europe's intentions, Kagan centers his argument on the growing self-centered policies of Europe and questions the validity of cohesive terms such as `west' in his chapter "Is It Still `The West'"?
Finally, it seems Kagan provides a solution to this insolvable problem of the US- Europe divide in his concluding chapter, "Adjusting to Hegemony", by simply stating one line - "the task for both Europeans and Americans is to readjust to the new reality of American hegemony".
This extremely small book, as compared to the issue it addresses needs further analysis and some close examining.
There are many issues to be addressed in Kagan's brief analysis and one might not be completely satisfied with certain claims, reasonings or the manner in which such a grave and sensitive topic is handled.
While there is a tone of underlying bias (in contrast to the general opinion of a well-balanced view that the author holds), Kagan manages to miss out some crucial facts and figures, not to mention present stark paradoxes, and the essay lacks sufficient citings.
To start with, let me point out the contradictions in Kagan's arguments, the presence of which highly undermines his claims, leaving the reader in a dilemma unconvinced of either argument.
Kagan claims, "Europe's relative weakness has understandably produced a powerful European interest in building a world where military strength and hard power matter less than economic and soft power...rules of behavior" (pg.37).
He goes on to say, - "Since Europeans lack the capacity to undertake unilateral military actions, either individually or collectively as `Europe,' it is natural that they should oppose allowing others to do that they cannot do themselves.
"(pg.38) in contrast to "...Europe today has the wealth and technological capability to make itself more of a world power in military terms if Europe wanted to become that kind of world power" (pg.53-54).
Kagan contradicts his own views, stating many times that Europe is militarily weak, nor does it have the capacity to build up its forces yet at the same time, puts forth an argument of Europe's capabilities of increasing its defense spending and military might to match the US.
In the chapter, Psychologies of Power and Weakness, Kagan's one claim contradicts another which is made in the next chapter as the reasoning for both his claims seem to be absolutely tangential.
He first explains Europe's greater tolerance for threats is due to its weakness and the fearful past, which it has suffered from.
He then metaphorically explains it by giving the example of a man with a knife and the same one with a rifle having different interpretations of the word `threat' when confronting a bear (pg.31).
But again Kagan himself feels Europe can become a military power as and when it wishes to, when he says "They could easily spend twice as much as they are currently spending on defense if they believed it necessary to do so" (pg.54).
So this forces me to ask a question, would one be mauled by a bear if one could produce a rifle to prevent this misfortune?
So isn't it quite possible that Europeans feel safe, not because they "...enjoy the `free ride' they have gotten under the American security umbrella over the past six decades" (pg.54), but rather because there was and is no real threat at all?
With the use of phrases such as "The Axis of Evil" and "Rouge States" (pg.30), which Kagan uses to describe Iraq and Iran, not to mention his references to `Weapons of Mass Destruction' (which he uses as a pretext to the war in Iraq), which still seem to be elusive for some reason, he seems to perplex me by blatantly ignoring his own creation.
While Kagan maintains that Iraq was a threat and the US perceived it as one while Europe did not, he might want to explain as to why, in 1997, he (Kagan was the Director of the Project for the New American Century) signed a document which justifies American occupation of the Middle-East, irrespective of threats from Iraq or Iran.
"The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security.
While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein... From an American perspective, the value of such bases would endure even should Saddam pass from the scene.
Over the long term, Iran may well prove as large a threat to U.S. interests in the Gulf as Iraq has.
And even should U.S.-Iranian relations improve; retaining forward-based forces in the region would still be an essential element in U.S. security strategy given the longstanding American interests in the region.
"(pg.17 - Rebuilding America's Defenses - *1) This forces me to conclude that either the author has resorted to `cherry picking' of evidence or he suffers from selective amnesia.
Some of his reasoning, analysis and analogies seem to be too nave.
When explaining military action, one cannot justify it by saying, "When you have a hammer, all problems start to look like nails".
The author speaks about the nation's (US's) willingness to go to war simply because it has the ability and the capacity to do so.
Without discussing a need or providing concrete reasons for the use of aggression, the author seems to be content in justifying use of force, simply because one has it.
One important aspect Kagan leaves out in his analysis are the political and economical aspects of the ongoing US-Europe feud.
While I have discussed some economical aspects later in the review, one must note that Kagan does not mention the Kyoto Protocol (apart from Clinton's negotiation of it (pg.45)).
The US withdrawal from the Protocol had created serious problems and divisions between the two giants (www.climnet.org - *2).
While there were many other issues that further fanned the growing fire, disagreements over the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty for example, which Kagan conveniently sweeps under the carpet, needed to be addressed if one is discussing transatlantic relations (www.bbcnews.com - *3, 4) For a book which covers issues from the pre World War II decade (occasionally going back to ancient philosophy) to the present issues, 72 citations, from which many are simply extended explanations (for examples, see supra notes- 19, 20, 22), seem to be alarmingly low, especially with the absence of some important ones and not to mention, certain citations which wrongly allude to historical facts.
Kagan mentions, "As `some' Europeans put it, the real division of labor consisted of the United States making the dinner and the Europeans doing the dishes" (pg.23), yet he does not refer to any source for this cynical statement.
He says, "The vast majority of Europeans always believed that the threat (if any) posed by Saddam was more tolerable than the risk of removing him" along with other alleging statements like, "The rehabilitation and reintegration of Saddam Hussein's Iraq is precisely what they(Europe) sought" (pg.44) , and again gives no source for the origin of these beliefs.
Strangely, he supports one of his claims by stating in his supra note.20, pg.30, "for that matter, this is also the view commonly found in American textbooks".
One might not generally expect to see such puerile purporting evidence in a scholarly analysis of transatlantic relations.
Kagan at times jumps back to Athenian times and has injected strong philosophies in his essay.
He mentions a number of times how Americans see the world from a Hobbesian perspective while Europeans are followers of Kantinian policies.
Kagan seems to have overlooked the fact, that though Hobbes had described the state of nature as that of "all against all", the only reason Hobbes justifies a sovereignty is to ensure peace on earth.
Kagan conveniently cites Hobbes (Hobbes theory itself was flawed as later philosophers termed it as `Hobbes Dilemma') to justify American aggression, but no where in Hobbes' theory is aggression justified by the sovereign (Leviathan - Ch.17).
There are some conclusions Kagan draws which seem to be beliefs of an American idealist living in a world where politics is as pure as religion.
He concludes that while the US was providing "free security" to Europe after the Cold War, "...America's great power and willingness to assume responsibility for protecting other nations..." (pg.34) has given Europe the opportunity to build up economically.
Kagan further asserts his point when he says, "Given America's willingness to spend so much money protecting them, Europeans would rather spend their own money on social welfare programs, long vacations and shorter workweeks" (pg.54).
These are inaccurate presentations of facts, which are more of subjective, bias ideologies.
I would like to put forth two points in order to accentuate the conspicuous fallacy of these two statements.
First, America's interest in Europe was not to provide it with security whether before or after the Cold War.
One must not confuse the fact that measures taken to restrict the Soviet advance was purely for selfish motives, rather than for the benefit of nations which were under the watchful eye of the communist empire (Kagan himself acknowledges the fact when he says, "With the check of the Soviet power removed, the United States was free to intervene practically whenever and wherever it chose..."(pg26)).
Second, when Kagan acknowledges that Europe which has a "$9 trillion " economy is in a comfortable position to support its welfare programs along with increased military spending; attributing the fact that Europe spends more on welfare, as he calls them "free-riders", results in a faulty analysis.
When I had mentioned earlier that Kagan chose to omit and ignore certain facts, the example of the Balkans, which the author has cited many times in his book would seem most relevant.
Kosovo is one of the primary issues he discusses to bring forth US benevolence and European incapacity.
"American involvement in Kosovo or Bosnia was not based on calculations of a narrow American `national interest'...While Americans had a compelling moral interest in stopping genocide and ethnic cleansing,... the US had no `national interest' at stake in the Balkans"(pg.50), this is how Kagan sees it.
Indeed stopping genocide was a concern, but was it the only concern?
While Milosevic had very much agreed to station NATO troops in Kosovo to stop the conflicts, none seem to have been interested in his offer; they rather wanted complete access and control to all of Yugoslavia.
The Rambouillet Accord, to which the Contact Group added an Appendix B on the last day of the conference held at Paris, one must note was the primary reason for rejecting NATO troops, as it demanded Yugoslavia to surrender its autonomy and sovereignty.
Yet, he does not mention of Milosevic agreeing to station NATO troops in Kosovo (http://wsws.org *5).
Some thing missing from Kagan's entire book are the words "Latin America" and "Africa".
As seen above, Kagan believes America was spending its money protecting Europe and Europe alone from all the threats around the world, before and after the Cold War.
But what baffles me to quite an extent is that not once does Kagan mention about any American intervention in Latin America (official or not), Africa or the Far East for that matter.
Those who are well aware of the world around them, will be aware of America's support for dictators and other corrupt regimes throughout Latin America and the far East, Indonesia for example, which were for self serving purposes alone or is it that the author is implying that the Latin American and African countries were a threat to Europe, hence the interventions and no mention of them?
(A complete timeline by Steven Kangas can be found on multiple sites *6, 7, 8) There is one severe `defect', as I put it, which undermines the entire argument of this book.
Kagan's tunneled vision approach, which refers to the word `power' only in terms of military strength and capabilities, ultimately results in a false dichotomy, which is the stumbling stone for his thesis.
Kagan believes the world and in particular, Europe, is left with two options, that either they follow the US or be a tacit audience.
The reason he reaches this conclusion as I previously put it, is due to his convergent view.
"Rather than viewing the US as a Gulliver tied down by Lilliputian threads", says Kagan, "American leaders should realize that they are hardly constrained at all, that Europe is not really capable of constraining the US".
He reinforces this claim throughout his book (see pg- 33, 37-40, 59, 62, etc).
The author's abysmal ignorance about hard-hitting, highly valid and relevant facts has rendered severe blows to the validity of his claims.
Kagan has committed serious errors here, by ignoring Europe's strength, not military but political and economical indeed.
With a population of 456,953,258 (the CIA Fact Book *9) and still growing, the EU, leave aside Europe, cannot be simply overlooked or brushed aside as a dead competitor or a bygone culture.
Europe is economically strong enough to trouble the US as and when it wants to, the recent problems over the genetically altered meat, banana dispute, steel industry debacle, Airbus-Boeing clash and many more, have all proved that Europe's economic strength is much of a concern for the US.
While I must point out a rank deletion, I believe this is `the' single factor which is capable for arguing against all of Kagan's thesis and arguments, and that is the American Economy.
Not once has he mentioned the deteriorating state of American economy (2001), even though problems did exist when he wrote this book.
He seems to be blissfully ignorant and persists that America can sustain its exorbitant defense spending, "...the US can sustain its current military spending levels and its current global dominance far into the future".
Strangely, the growing inflation rate, rising unemployment, stagflation, trends the economy was showing of heading towards a recession, were I believe dismissed as myths by the author (for statistics see - www.bbcnews.com; http://wsws.org *10, 11).
Also, Kagan's final solution suggest that, "The obvious answer is that Europe should.... and build up its military, even if only marginally", leaves me with a conundrum.
Is Kagan implicating that Europe has no military at all or is it that he wants to begin a new arms race, this time Cold War II?
Kagan must understand he is writing this book for international publics and not simply those, whose ideologies are in tandem with his.
Hence, I doubt most would disagree that the world should get into an arms race here, as we all know, there is no stopping to this evil if it once starts.
While I have already discussed the effects of trade and economics (which Kagan ignores) on the US-Europe relation, there is something I must point out before I end this review.
Kagan, rather conveniently digresses of the topic, which is transatlantic relationships, to justifying US hegemony in a neo-conservative fashion.
While most Americans themselves would probably not agree with Kagan's ideology (as the public opinion and faith plummets - see polls from various news sources *12), leave aside Europeans or rest of the world, Kagan writes almost 15 pages to justify it.
This was a rather disappointing conclusion to his book, where he thinks the only solution to the ever widening divide is "Adjusting to Hegemony".
When Kagan says how many (statistics seem to abandon him) Americans believe that by advancing their interest, they advance the interest of humanity, he sounds exuberantly jingoistic and to drive the point home, he quotes Benjamin Franklin as saying - "America's cause is the cause of all mankind" and again I must bring to the author's notice, the recipient of these remarks is an international audience, which is diverse, has its own culture and heritage, religious beliefs and ideologies and has no reason to believe why their culture or beliefs are inferior to any other.
An author of his stature must realize that it is transatlantic relationships and not a primary grade bully that is being discussed.
While he seems to take pride in saying that America has a "go it alone" attitude (pg.39, 99), it does not abide by the UN Security Council (pg.40, 99), takes action unilaterally irrespective of international laws (pg.45, 61, 99), is justified in adopting `double standards' (pg.62, 99), he fails to fathom the gravity of the current day (or rather the day when he wrote this book) situation and the growing unpopularity of American foreign policy around the world.
While he sees Europe as an obstacle in the path of America's imperialistic goals, a neutral observer would be more than justified in pointing out that may be it is the US that hinders progress and efforts of the EU to establish a world which respects international laws, human rights, collective public opinion and most of all - peace.
He fails to give an impartial, if not a complete solution to rid the world of this wedge as he weakly concludes his essay by saying, "...a little common understanding can still go a long way".
While many have nothing but words of praise, as a one line summary by Francis Fukuyama calls it - "Brilliant" (a co-architect and signatory of the Rebuilding America's Defense Project) and according to Dr. Henry Kissinger, [against whom innumerable charges of human right violations have been levied, who ironically, Kagan terms as a "quintessential realist".
See - http://en.wikipedia.org(for cases) *13; http://www.thenation.com(for list of crimes) *14] the book is a "seminal treatise" which would "shape the (US-Europe relation) discussion for years to come"; I do not particularly endorse it it.
As I have already put forth immense supportive data to show why the book lacks a concrete argument, sane reasoning or supportive evidence, though its lucid prose, easy comprehension and its articulate linking makes it a good read, it barely digs deep into the problem or the solution, apart from scratching the surface, `the military surface'.
Indeed the book did create waves in the political arena, which was probably due to its impeccable timing, but I cast serious doubts on the claims that it would be "discussed for years to come".

I stumbled upon Matthew Reilly's novel in the new release section of my public library.
I had never heard of him before, this being his first release in the United States, but the synopsis on the inside of the dust jacket caught my attention so I decided to give the book a try.
Most books coming out now have author blurbs of recommendation I take with a grain of salt.
Most of these authors are paid for their reviews or they are personnal friends, making it difficult to determine the sincerity of the review.
Everything is promised to be a "white, knuckle thriller" or my personal favorite "a rollercoaster ride of excitement" but the majority of the time the book does not live up to the hype.
This is definately not the case with "Ice Station".
This book is Action with a capital A!
How this book has not been optioned for film bewilders me because if it is done right it would be one of the best action films of the past twenty years.
The book alone left me exhausted.
For a quick intro without giving anything away (because I hate spoilers) a crisis emerges at an isolated Antarctic research station.
A marine recon team is sent to investigate and all hell breaks loose.
This is not an exaggeration.
When the action begins in this book it does not let up.
Every time I thought the book was going to have a down moment to give me the opportunity to eat or get some sleep, I got cold cocked by a left hook.
The characters only pause in the book to reload.
Now there will be nay sayers out there who will criticize that the book lacks any real substance.
Maybe there could have been more characterization, perhaps there is a fact or two off when utilizing military jargon or technology, or maybe an event bends the laws of probability but all I can say is I don't care.
I had fun with this book.
For the two days I read the book I had a blast.
This is not a contender for the pulitzer prize.
It is not going to pop up on Oprah's book club.
This is a summer action movie put to words and I dare you not to have fun.
I may have discovered Matthew Reilly in the library but now I purchase his books as soon as they are released in hardcover.
I know what to expect and he never disappoints.
The third book of a series and follow the story line.
I have not finished it yet but am enjoying it
The premise of the store is interesting.
How did left tackle become one of the most important positions in football?
The first half of the book does a fair job of walking through the reasons.
(West Coast offense, LT, etc.)
Unfortunately, at that point Lewis runs out of things to write about, so he starts talking about Michael Oher, an O Lineman at Ole Miss.
Oher's story is intersting, but it is too early to tell.
He is a "superstar" but only a sophomore.
I also think that Lewis overdoes how great Oher already is.
I also don't really understand what Oher's story really had to do with the original premise of the book.
Is Lewis saying that because left tackles now make millions, Oher wants to be one?
I would think that if Oher had come around in the 70s people would still have thought of him as a football player.
Last time I checked lineman were big and strong (and quick) in that era too.
I've enjoyed Johansen's books for years, but this one was awful...I'm beginning to wonder if she's using a ghost writer.
Totally ridiculous plot, trite dialogue...I lost count of the times she used the phrase "Sophie said through her teeth..." I was beginning to wish someone was PULLING my teeth rather than having to read this book.
Johansen is capable of SO MUCH BETTER than this!
I'm praying she isn't falling into the Nora Roberts/Danielle Steel/James Patterson habit of churning out the same old tired fodder just to meet a publisher's deadline
John Little and Peter Sisco wrote static contraction... but John takes it a step further and eliminates the need for doing reps with scientific explanations to back up his revolutionary concept of weight training/ muscle building.. My girlfriend and I started doing this method in may of 2005 and I can honestly say i've never found such a fast, quick and easy way to build muscle.
This is also a great method for those not wanting to spend hours in a gym... after a while, you only need to workout once a week... but don't forget to stretch afterwards... and don't forget to do cardio on other days.
I've never been able to develop the 6pack abs until I used the techniques in this book... not to mention all the other muscles popping out that I never knew were there before!
I don't entirely agree with his take on supplements - although I think he's referring to all the stupid gimmicks out there designed to waste your time and money.
Apparently he's not familiar with Shaklee
We see a phrase a lot when we visit how-to sites for writers.
World building.
By this, we mean the setting, the characters, and everything else where our story will occur.
For me, this often means maps, memories and visits, since I write about where I live.
But if you'd like to see exactly what "world building" means, head down to your local library and grab SALEM'S LOT by Stephen King.
Yeah, that's right, I'm reviewing a book by Stephen King.
As if his career really needs my help.
(I bought my copy at Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Lu in Hangzhou, with a new introduction that is a pleasure to read, but I mentioned the library to save you some money.)
When Stephen King mania first gripped the English-speaking world, I missed it.
I saw the film of CARRIE and hated it.
Years later, at a guard desk on a long shift, scheduled so suddenly that I hadn't had a chance to visit the library, I read what was in the desk instead.
THINNER.
If I were Stephen King, I'd have put a pen name on that crap as well.
One of King's fans brought me around.
She recommended THE SHINING.
Of course I thought of that Kubrick/Nicholson travesty.
No no, she said, read the book.
It's much different.
Yes, it is.
It's fantastic for its perceptiveness.
Next up, PET SEMATARY, which scared the crap out of me.
And that, my friends, is not easy.
ON WRITING.
I've gushed about that enough times.
The films STAND BY ME and THE APT PUPIL.
So, in the end, I appreciate King and forgive him for CARRIE, and I think he's forgiven himself.
We won't talk about the Richard Bachman alias, although the film of THE RUNNING MAN was fun in a stupid sort of way.
SALEM'S LOT.
King's second book, and perhaps it should have been his first.
I've been in China since 1999.
If I ever want to visit a town in the US, I don't need a plane ticket.
I can just real SALEM'S LOT.
Consider it a clinic on world building.
These are the places and the people I left behind, right there, recorded by a master.
Well, except for the vampire.
I don't recall seeing him in Watha.
Maybe he moved into my old house.
Actually, that's Stephen King right there.
He creates an entirely real world, then throws in something unusual because it makes the story move and because he just thinks it's cool.
A vampire here, a rabid dog there, a mind reader over there, a UFO crashing into Hickville... Nobody has defended Stephen King by mentioning that William Shakespeare trucked heavily with ghosts and witches and prophesies in his stories, so I'll limit myself to a single sentence.
I believe that, just as I studied Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN in a Literature class, one day students will study Stephen King.
Just nothing about cars that come to life, because those stories really suck.
I will accuse Stephen King of being uneven, and he explains why in ON WRITING.
But at his best, I recommend him highly.
Oh, and here's a weird bit of trivia.
I recognized the scene on page 50.
Nothing before it, nothing after it, just that one bit.
So I at least began reading this book.
Probably at a guard desk.
Tampa, Florida, has excellent libraries.
At my guard desk, when I wasn't writing, I was getting drunk on literature, and I can't possibly remember it all.
But I think SALEM'S LOT by Stephen King plus THE THANATOS SYNDROME by Walker Percy spurred me to write THE DEMONS WITHIN, which I later threw out but which gave DESCENT INTO MADNESS its back story.
(For Madman trivia buffs: Terrence and Sandra Howell once had their own novel.
It really sucked.
Terrence had his own novel 15 years before that.
It also sucked.
He's a composite of two classmates, Terrence Cram and Ricky Howell, so I'm glad he finally showed up in some form.)
In ON WRITING, Stephen King tells us that he was so drunk and stoned at one point that he can't remember writing some of his books.
It seems I was so high on literature at one point that I forgot entire books I read, including SALEM'S LOT.
So, I guess that getting old does have its advantages.
Angels was the smallest college in Cambridge.
It was built at the beginning of the 15th century.
Fairly had a fellowship.
St. Angelicus students had to find their own lodgings.
Fred Fairly had taken the science tripos and received a first class degree.
He came from a rectory and so his material wants were limited.
He was used to making do.
At the end of his first year as a junior fellow he wanted to tell his father he was no longer a Christian.
Fred knew the country was not a place of peace.
The Rectory had been built in 1830.
Daisy Saunders wanted to know how the human body worked and applied for nursing training.
She was seventeen and her mother had died recently and she was free to live away from home.
Daisy, now known as Saunders, was a probationer during her first year.
She was told to keep her eye on James Elder, an attempted suicide via the Thames.
It was January 1912.
To all the patients, except for the dying, food was of paramount importance.
Elder refused to eat.
The constable had said he was a gentleman.
He asked Daisy if the incident had appeared in the press.
For arranging for a notice about Elder's conduct in the newpaper, Daisy was dismissed.
Fred Fairly and Daisy were in an accident with bicycles.
A Good Samaritan thought they were married to each other and put them to bed together in the spare room to regain their health.
Fred was enchanted and afterwards he looked everywhere to locate Daisy.
The kindness of the Wrayburns, the Samaritans, gave Daisy a place to stay in Cambridge.
She would do work in the house in exchange for room and board.
She had traveled to Cambridge to find work in a private hospital.
Happily Daisy was employed at the mental hospital and Fred found her again at the Wrayburns'.
They went for a walk in the country.
Fred asked Daisy to marry him.
Mr. Wrayburn told Daisy that Fred could not be a junior fellow if he married.
In the trial, pertaining to the accident, the journalist, who had accompanied Daisy to Cambridge, was able to identify the man who drove the horse cart wildly causing the accident.
When the heart is broken, efficiency is impaired.
There was some suggestion in the testimony of the journalist that Daisy had been or would have been used, but for the happening of the accident.
Daisy had to leave the Wrayburns and Cambridge because of what was disclosed in court.
Leaving her lodgings, she was free at last to cry over the hurt she had caused Fred.
Daisy and Fred passed each other on her way to the train station.
We do not know what action, if any, resulted.
Both of the young characters are portrayed as having beautiful consciences.
The writing is elegant.
I liked this book because it was quick and easy to read, but also had more in-depth information in the back.
Each month, there is a chart of symptoms to let you know what is important to go to the ER, call your doc, or wait 24 hours to check.
There were great decision guides that presented both sides.
I like that I know a reputable hospital stands behind the book, as well.
I have 6 pregnancy books, but this one is my favorite
The book is divided into 52 chapters that repeat basically the same points over and over again.
So you have to read through the chapters and try to spot the occasional new idea.
It seems strange that a book on productivity makes you waste time gleaning a few good ideas.
(Come on, man, if you have 10 pages of good ideas, give them to me in 10.)
But then again I guess most books in this genre make you do that.
Sheesh
As a pharmacy student, I found the Washington Manual to be the best pocket guide for looking up guidelines and treatment options, as well as interaction charts and pregnancy categories.
This is a well written book that covers most of the major cronic health conditions and treatment.
This book does not waste time and space talking about every detail of each disease state, but rather focuses on the causes, measurements and treatments.
My only criticism is that this latest edition is dated 2004 and in medical therapeutics, is considered old
This is one of two or three pppppppppp quot;must have pppppppppp quot; books that every person interested in or practicing Smalltalk needs to read and keep on a shelf near by.
Kent's writing style is clear, concise and often humorous.
A very entertaining and informative book by one of the giants in the Smalltalk world
This book is thrilling.
You will learn of the first three minutes of our existence in this universe.
Not only do you learn of what is believed to have happened during the first three minutes, but you will also learn the exciting story of how it was discovered.
The book is written at a level that can be understood by the lay person.
My brother had severe acne a year or so ago that he inherited from my Dad's side of the family.
He had tried antibiotics with no success and wanted to go on Accutane.
Having heard bad things about the side effects, my Dad wanted my brother to try the diet for a couple months before deciding to take the medication.
He faithfully followed it with no results whatsoever.
Some of the ideas in the book are absurd - as a diabetic with a horrible eating habit and no teenage acne, I can tell you that the focus on dieting and insulin spikes as a direct cause of of the condition is preposterous.
When I was a teenager, I'd go on serious candy binges that required insulin doses bordering on the irresponsible, and I got through high school with only the occasional zit.
I've read that for a small number of people, diet can be a factor for acne, but obviously our experience points to something else as the primary cause (this assumes you eat reasonably well - malnutrition isn't sexy).
Since medication should always be a last resort, a change of diet is probably a good first approach for those with minor blemishes, but those with a serious condition should look elsewhere.
For the curious, while my brother had some strong side effects from the Accutane (none dangerous, primarily incredibly dry skin and eyes), it certainly succeeded in clearing up his skin
I was so impressed with this book that I wrote the following letter to its author: I just completed your book Time Tactics of Very Successful People.
The book is truly a masterpiece, and I have found it immeasurably helpful in my ongoing pursuit to become the best person that I can be.
Your book is full of wisdom and great ideas, the value of which is many times the price I paid for the book.
I have read the works of personal development legends like Napoleon Hill, Brian Tracy, W. Clement Stone, Tony Robbins, Mark Victor Hansen and others and have benefited from all of them, but I really enjoyed reading your book because I found that you offered some fresh ideas that these other great men did not.
I am sure that the extraordinary concepts your book provides will enrich my spirit, enlighten my mind, and serve as conduits for achieving my goals for the rest of my life.
I really liked the way that you ended the book.
The quote you gave from Earl Nightengale perfectly reflects my philosophy for successful living, but helped me crystallize my thinking in a way that has helped refines my philosophy further.
Thanks again for providing the world such a valuable resource, a guide which I am certain has helped and will continue to help many others to live happier, more productive, and more peaceful lives.
This book deals with some fairly rediculous topics.
I'm not into mysticism or talisman's or that stuff, so perhaps I am biased.
It did provide a useful history of the 'masonic' symbol on the American one-dollar bill, which I enjoyed.
But Hieronimus puts forth far too much theory regarding supernatural powers for my taste
As a health writer, I know that pharmaceuticals can be very dangerous compounds.
But for years, I overlooked the fact that drugs aren't good for pets either.
Your cat can probably benefit from safer alternative treatments.
Martin Zucker has put together a wonderful book with top veterinarians.
Don't keep alternative and holistic treatments to yourself -- share them with your pet
This novel is set in the 40's, when Elizabeth Short (the Black Dahlia) was found murdered, her body cut in two.
The characters revolve around the investigation of this incident, altnough her name is changed.
The chapters go back and forth between the views of two brothers: one, an amoral cop, the other, a Catholic priest, Monsignor, businessman, whatever you want to call him.
Neither one is likable, the 40's cop jargon is incomprehensible, and the Catholic politics/building programs are boring.
However, the murder is solved and the end is neatly tied up with a bow.
If old cop stories appeal to you, you might like this, but I'm sure you could find better.
Double Indemnity, for instance, is superior
A lot of these reviews say that they've read this book and it's "done wonders" for them and everyone they've recommended it to.
The book itself will not do wonders unless you work on the things Gawain suggests.
It's not a miracle cure-all book - it's about giving you the motivation to do something about your life instead of sitting back and watching the trail roll out behind you.
I read this book in college when I was going through a little bit of a rough patch, figuring out what I wanted, etc.
Now that I've graduated and am slowly becoming wary of the corporate world, I need more positivity in my life so I'm re-reading it in the hopes that I can zero in on my goals and start achieving them again.
I highly recommend it to those who are open-minded enough to give it a chance
If you want to take your pictures to the next level this is the book for you.
Fantastic and easy to follow .. for the advanced amateur and pro
I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me!
Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT!
Yes "wacky artist" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages!
Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter!
WE KNOW!
Don't tell us 100 times!
This is what I think: Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...OR she's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing.
Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work?
Also, is it cold stone sober?
Or STONE COLD SOBER?
(it should have been the latter) No editor caught that mistake?
I've been a fan of Ms. Steel's work for 21 years now and the past few year's works have been deplorable!
I first excused it due to the death of her son..
But her talent never picked up again.
From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff.
If you want to read a novel and not think about what you're reading...then read her books, this one especially.
If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky, Luanne Rice, Alison Clement, Susan Wiggs..
Background I read Isaac's Storm, by Erik Larson, around 1998.
Recently I had occasion to thumb through it again which has prompted this review.
Larson covered three killer hurricanes, two killer blizzards and one flash flood.
Galveston and related Hurricanes My first impression was that anyone who had read this book, about a major hurricane, would never consider riding out such a storm.
Larson painted a frightening story of brick homes and brick schools being torn apart by the surging waters.
Isaac Cline was the U. S. Weather Service Chief at Galveston at this time.
This book gives much detail on the Galveston storm.
This hit the island in September 1900, with very little warning.
Indeed it was the arrogance of the U. S. Weather Service in general, and Issac Cline, their station chief for this area, in particular, that essentially preempted any warning.
"Cline was one of the 'new men', a scientist who believed he knew all there was to know about the motion of clouds and the behavior of storms."
First, the U. S. Weather Service refused to pay any attention to any inputs from Cuba.
The U. S. Weather Service had men stationed in Cuba who "said the storm was nothing to worry about."
Cuban's "own weather observers, who had pioneered hurricane detection, disagreed."
Secondly the U. S. Weather Service insisted that, any storm warning had to come from the Washington office, with absolutely no exceptions.
Finally Isaac had the conviction, and public position, that no hurricane could ever hit Galveston, as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as Galveston.
With such a position Cline had no motivation to try and influence headquarters.
Larson cited two older hurricanes in his book.
* September 16, 1875 - "The storm raised an immense dome of water and shoved it through Indianola, pushing the waters of the Gulf and Matagorda Bay inland until for 20 miles the back country prairie was an open sea."
This storm took 176 lives.
* August 20, 1886 - This storm completed the destruction of Indianola.
So many residents were killed that the survivors abandoned the town completely.
In 1891, "in the wake of a tropical storm that Galveston weathered handily" Cline was asked to appraise the city's vulnerability to extreme weather.
Isaac wrote: "The opinion held by some - - - that Galveston at some time will be seriously damaged by some such disturbance is simply an absurd delusion."
He made this statement in spite of the fact that the maximum elevation of Galveston Island, at that time, was an almost trivial 8.7 feet above sea level.
He made it also in spite of the two killer hurricanes hitting and destroying the town of Indianola, about 150 miles southwest of Galveston on Matagorda Bay.
Cline had a "model" of Gulf hurricanes, namely that no hurricane could ever hit Galveston, as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as Galveston.
His "model" of these storms was clearly fatally flawed, or politically influenced, and it resulted in 6,000 to 10,000 deaths.
Larson suggests there was a "scent of boosterism" behind this article, and that he was writing an article that Galveston promoters would be happy to see.
Could this have been a harbinger of things to come?
Could Cline have been the first government weather scientist to prostitute himself by writing favorable papers on the weather for his sponsors?
Then the storm hit.
Both the U. S. Weather Service and Isaac Cline looked very arrogant before the storm, and also in defending their overall performance, after the storm.
Other extreme weather events Larson also covered two blizzards and one flash flood in his book in this book.
* Hail and flash flood, August 1885 - "a severe downpour near San Angelo, including hailstones the size of ostrich eggs, killed hundreds of cattle and created a flash flood with An escarpment of water that Isaac estimated to be 15 or 20 feet high."
* Blizzard, November 1888 - this surprise blizzard destroyed 150 vessels off New England, and caused the death of 450.
* Blizzard, January 1899 - "this blizzard swept much of the South.
Icebergs 10 feet high flowed down the Mississippi past New Orleans."
This storm even hit Galveston and piled snow on it's beaches and drove water out of the Bay into the Gulf exposing portions of the bay bottom.
Conclusion Isaac's Storm shows the incredoble wrath of hurricanes, 105 to 125 years ago.
It also depicts the incredible spectrum of extreme weather events, also of the same vintage.
All in all a most interesting and rewarding book, one that I would recommend highly.
Because you wait and wait, and then three don't turn up at once
From about the second page of this book, I was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it.
The characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another.
Add to that the stereotypical characters (the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys, the women are all "large-assed" or fat with the exception of Ella).
And the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters' sexual proclivities was so completely dumb, not to mention kind of repulsive (I like a good sex scene as much as the next person, but Tuck's descriptions are completely banal).
Oh wait, there's more.
The Spanish is ATROCIOUS.
It's hard to believe that Tuck had a translator for this book.
It's pretty clear that whoever copy edited it neither reads nor writes nor speaks Spanish.
Half the names are grammatically incorrect.
Many of the words are just plain wrong ("vita" means life in Italian, not Spanish, for starters).
I felt embarrased for the author.
Does she know that her book is full of errors?
The one word that comes to mind when thinking about this book is: SHALLOW.
I sincerely hope that readers don't mistake this book for historical fiction.
The author clearly knows little about Paraguay and its people and history, and clearly doesn't care, from her superficial treatment of it.
As usual, Robin Cook keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end.
Excellent reading
I read exactly half the book and stopped.
Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision.
As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back!
The book is silly and laughable.
The premise sounded great - but the book is bad.
Really bad
Robin Williams used to tell a joke about his son, saying that whenever he got angry with him his son would say 'you hit me and I'll write a book.'
I'd like to tell you that there is some deeper meaning behind Peggy Salinger's memior about life with her father, but it seems to more or less boil down to that same idea.
Although there are some interesting revelations about Salinger as a man, his daughter doesn't seem to appreciate that many of the problems she faced in her youth were not neccessarily unique to being the daughter of JD Salinger, they're the problems that children of divorce and children who live in rural areas face everyday.
There's a lot of blame thrown around here, and not a whole lot of admitting to one's own mistakes.
Although this is probably to be expected, it's still frustrating, since Margaret Salinger has more or less made a career out of trading on her father's good name, and since many of her chief complaints about her famous father are largely hypocritical.
(Complaining about your father's desire for privacy but refusing to mention the name of your first husband was probably a bad idea.)
I admit that her father is probably not as nice a guy as you think he would be, but this is not really a revelation, nor should it affect your feelings about his work.
I wouldn't recommend reading it unless your working on a thesis of some sort
I can't go on enough about this book.
It should be required reading in colleges and for those in all levels of government, Wall Street and industry CEOs.
The writing is excellent.
Many of its passages read like prayers.
I can't think of topics and subjects more important than those Jensen writes about -- our cultures diconnection from the natural world and from ourselves and how it has impacted our mental and spiritual health and the health of the earth.
Jensen is so passionate about these topics that he does repeat certain ideas, BUT instead of ruining it, I think the non-linear trajectory of his book actually enhances his message.
The first half of the book where he discusses problems can be hard-hitting and difficult to get through certain parts of it, BUT please hold fast through the end.
It is worth it.
Jensen's eloquence and wisdom are best when he is also discussing answers, or possibilities, as it were.

Nora's "In The Garden" Trilogy was great, but I must say not her best.
Her characters are so life-like and you actually feel like you're part of the story.
She's a phenomenal author and I have not come across anything of hers that I have not thoroughly enjoyed.
I also highly recommend "The Three Sisters Island Trilogy."
By far my favorite.
Happy Reading!
I just finished reading this book and loved it.
It helps put things into perspective.
I would recommend it to anyone who is going through trials in their life.
It's on my all time favorite books list, I just bought a copy for my mother-in-law and am encouraging many of my friends to read it
We know some things about Saul of Tarsus (later named the Apostle Paul) but a complete biography is always lacking because of sketchy and incomplete information.
Most everything we know from Paul is from the Dr. Luke in the Book of Acts or Paul's epistles themselves.
II Peter Chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements.
Peter, in some of his last earthly words before martyrdom, validates Paul's apostleship and states that some of his writings and teachings are difficult but that we should follow them.
Pollock's book is presented as documentary-style reading since Paul's complete biography is not entirely clear.
There is much the author states is inference or speculation.
If you can respect that and not build doctrine and facts on where the evidence is fuzzy, I think this is an excellent book.
One example of "fuzzy" facts that Pollock considers is the age-old controversy over the authorship of the Book of Hebrews.
The author of Hebrews does not identify himself and scholars argue who wrote it.
Pollock speculates that Paul, while imprisioned in Acts Ch.
24 for two years may have had time and motivation to write the book to the people he so desparately wanted to reach.
With his imprisonment and his controversial style among the Jews, he may have left his identity anonymous so he himself would not be a stumbling block to reach his Jewish brothers.
Eternity will reveal who wrote the Book of Hebrews but it is certainly a plausible theory.
Overall, the greatest benefit in reading this book is to provide a better framework for understanding Paul as he travels among the early churches and wrote letters to them correcting the various false teachings and problems that developed.
Mark Levine really, really, really knows his stuff.
Mark Levine is really, really, good at explaining what he knows.
Note: This book is not for beginners, but if you're ready to expand your jazz skills, there is no better book I've seen (except for his Jazz Piano book!)
Harvey Mackay was one of the first authors I had read on how to run a business.
The book is written in an entertaining manner, and contains a great deal of fantastic advice.
To this day, friends who were around me when I read this book in college will quote parts of it back to me.
It contains tidbits of guidance, some great, some small.
All good.
This book is HYSTERICAL!
Check out the video (above) of the housewife slapping her husband's butt with a spoon while she's got him bent over the kitchen counter!!!!!!
FUNNY
While entertaining, I found several times that the story slowed down and got a little preachy about the politics of drug money.
While probably true it distracted from the story by being repeated and heavy handed.
I also found the timeline hard to believe.
Maybe because I have lived in the area and understand the distances (and traffic) travelled in short periods of time.
I am a big Elizabeth Lowell fan (as well as Ann Maxwell) but this was not one of her better books
I've read only a few of Hillerman's previous Leaphorn/Chee novels.
I've enjoyed what I've rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don't indulge in them very often.
I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee' phase.
From what I gather, 'Skeleton Man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman's last few novels.
Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment.
'Skeleton Man' starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956.
While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life'(See Nelson De Mille's 'Night Fall'), Hillerman fails here.
The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called 'action'.
Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story.
The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman's earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here.
Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee's wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived 'Superman rescues Lois' situations.
Better to stick with Hillerman's earlier novels.
The 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits Hillerman, I'm afraid
Rose Madder was one the first books that got me hooked on Stephen King.
This story is phenomenal, in my opinion.
I have to admit the first time I read it I was a little confused.
I was not one to be to much into "sci fi" fantasy type stuff.
This, like any good story or movie is best when it is read a few times.
Then you really get to pick up the subtle hints that you may have missed before.
Then again I am a bit biased.
Rose Madder is right at the top of my list of most favorites (just below Bag of Bones
Greg Treverton has written a much needed overview of the national intelligence process and correctly identified the challenges which face the US, in a post-9/11 world.
His views of the world beyond 2010 are quite revealing and his challenges to the intelligence community to assess threats to the US are precisely focused.
His views on the major intelligence entities reveal urgent modifications of structure and process, if the intelligence community is going to regain relevance with national customers.
As a teacher of intelligence process, specifically as it relates to strategic warning, I believe this book is essential reading for anyone who aspires to be a true intelligence professional.
This book will help even the wisest analyst understand how to maximize available sources and methods.
The quest to provide the best possible intelligence is a goal which must be achieved.
Gail's writing is again wonderful in this in book, but I found the book disappointing due to a lack of closure.
I felt the book led you up to a particular point in the life of the character's and then left you wondering in the end what the message was meant to be.
I almost felt as if the writer wasn't brave enough enough to tell you the ending to a tragic, yet hopeful story.
I can only compare this book to the Samurai's Garden since I haven't read a third book by this author yet, and I loved the Samari's Garden!
So I was surprised that this book lacked closure at the end.
I am not sorry that I read this book due to the fact that I enjoy the author's style of writing
I was seduced by the sinister cover and the synopsis on the inside cover into thinking this was going to be a chilling account- Account my foot!
I gingerly turned the first page and instantly drowned in wave after wave of details.
As if the rough draft was a series of scraps stapled together and mailed off to an impatient publishe
John Lynch wrote a classic in Spanish-American Revolutions 1808-1826.
He masterfully describes all the events that led to the independence of Latin America from Spain.
The book starts in Rio de La Plata and ends in Mexico and Central America.
Curiously one can note a common pattern of highly stratified societies lead by Spanish officials and merchants in not complete harmony with the Creole ruling class.
The reluctance of Spanish Monarchy (and later even of liberals) led to independence basically motivated for the economic and social interests of the Creoles (Spanish born in America).
For all of those who are interested in a better understanding of Latin American societies of today this great book is a must.
Lynch cleverly combines historical and economic facts about the Hispanic American societies looking for free trade and in such a way clashing with the status quo of monopolies imposed by the decaying metropolis.
Two thumbs up
Dark Nature cuts to the very core of the will to survive.
Mr. Watson takes you on an easy to read journey "up" the food chain to the homo sapiens: who is neither man nor kind.
For me, Dark Nature removed judgment from the word "evil", giving a deeper, behind the scene look at what drives life.
A must read.
This copy was purchased a gift.
In my judgment to continue to grow I needed to understand this piece of myself and the world around me
Krakauer is highly confused and I can tell that so are some of these reviewers.
He cannot give insight into or shed light on something he knows little truth about himself.
The church he is talking about is completley separate from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
Jon Krakauer is nothing more than an sadly misinformed and idiotic person trying to enlighten his readers with things he has misinterpreted.
Books like these are written on every religion with hopes of discouraging the believers and proving to those that don't believe -that their assumptions were correct
Excellent, realistic, practical advice.
As parent of a very strong-willed two-year old, I continually found myself in a power struggle with him over EVERYTHING!
After reading this book in a couple of hours, I immediately began implementing the techniques (which are very common sense and SIMPLE), and now, just a couple of months later, I have a totally different relationship with my little boy.
I no longer feel like I am controlling him all the time, he is happily independent in ways we are both comfortable with.
This book really changed my life.
BTW, I had previously read the original Love and Logic for older children, which I liked, but it recommended spanking for children under 3.
This did NOT help!!!!!
This book recommends no spanking, but withdrawing all attention empathetically, which is what my pediatrician recommended, which actually works
If you liked Empire, you'll love Multitude.
The authors and reviewers alike speak of Multitude as a follow up to Empire, but I think something very different is happening here.
Hardt and Negri have pushed and pulled each other forward over a vast and forbidding territory, and in Multitude they have attained a height/depth of perception well beyond Empire.
If you are attempting to learn your radicalism, or inform your progressivism, through Hardt and Negri, then you may see Multitude as continuing from and expanding Empire, and you may also join the chorus bemoaning the perceived digressiveness and discursiveness of both books.
But what we actually have here are two attempts at the same fateful book: where Empire was the best try we had at the time, Multitude now succeeds.
Where the digression in Empire circled around the feeling of our world-cultural hematopoiesis, the discursion in Multitude captures it.
Fukuyama attempted to deal with Multitude in the July 25th NYT Book Review, and either utterly failed at, or purposefully decided to avoid, addressing the book qua philosophy.
At this point in his apologizing for economists, it is hard to imagine that Fukuyama's name has ever been mentioned in the same breath as Hegel, or that he has ever actually read any of the German Idealists;- whereas with Hardt and Negri, we almost have that level of man among us again.
For Fukuyama, history has indeed ended, because he has stopped feeling it and can now only move around his darkened signifiers.
For Hardt and Negri, and for those who have read, listened, and felt their way into the great becoming that is world history, we are indeed not at its end, but at its very beginning.
The chief problem with this book is that the English language, as a field of common meaning, is not up to handling this level of thought anymore.
(E.g., the very British cheery insufficiency of George Monbiot's 'Manifesto for a New World Order'.)
Hardt and Negri wrote Multitude in English, but were thinking in German, that neoplatonic lego of a language.
So, if you consider yourself progressive but can't get the feeling and sweep of Multitude, then trash your TV, stop reading anything written after 1930 for a few years, then come back to it.
You will find you have become allergic to CNN, but you will also find that - finally - you can *feel* what the world and her history are all about.
I'm not sure who's writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff.
Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues.
What's "fierce" about that?
The writing style and content just didn't flow.
Wasn't real.
I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term "bucko," as in, "Let me tell you something, bucko."
What are we in "Happy Days?"
Couldn't take the book seriously after that.
Very bad.
Among all the theories of ethics with which I am familiar, I have always found Kant's system to be the best: carrying out one's duty for the sake of the duty itself.
The problem with Kant, however, is that his theory of morality is grounded outside humanity, dependent on a source of which we can never, some may claim, have any understanding.
Christine Korsgaard fixes, at least for me, this problem, by showing that one does not have to venture outside humanity in order to ground its morality.
In short, the source of normativity is our humanity itself.
I don't want to get into too much details and give away the main points of the book.
Suffice it to say that it offers, in my opinion, some of the best arguments for the objectivity of morality.
The conclusion I reached after reading the book was this: It is as much justified for a human to complain 'Why should I be moral?'
as it is for him/her to complain 'Why should I have two eyes?'
In both cases, the answer is 'Because you are a human being, a social animal with two eyes.'
NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a significant Dickens in the uncannily absorbing way the narrative diversifies to various literary discourses.
The protagonist's experiences and encounters in adverse milieu through life not only embody melodrama, comic relief, political satire, class comedy, social criticism, and domestic farce, they allow Dickens the opportunity to portray, to the minutest nuance, an extraordinary cast of rogues and eccentrics.
The main frame of NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a quintessential Dickens: a generic, virtuous man who concerns with the affair of establishing his identity as a gentleman and the pruning of whom entwines him in a checkered fate.
Nicholas Nickleby has committed no fault and offenses, and yet he is to be entirely alone in the world, to be separated from the people he loves, and to be proscribed like a criminal.
The more unbearable the ordeals and the more injudicious the deal of the hand from life, the more profusely the novel accentuates Dickens' outrage at the cruelty and social injustice.
When Nicholas Nickleby is left exiguous after his father's death, he turns to his hard-hearted uncle to solicit succor.
But Ralph Nickleby, a most unscrupulous and avarious man he is, demonstrates that he is proof against all appeals of blood and kindred, and is steeled against every tale of distress and sorrows.
The man will never fail to exert any resolution or cunning that will promise increase of money for there is scarcely anything he will not have hazarded to gratify his greed.
It's not that he is unconscious of the baseness of the means with which he acquires his gains.
He cares only for gratification of his passions of avarice and hatred.
He might have from the beginning conceived dislike to his nephew whom he brazenly places in Squeers' Dotheboys Hall, a school for unwanted boys, as an assistant master.
The cruelty of Squeers, who's coarse and ruffian behavior even at his best temper, Nicholas has been an unwilling witness.
The filthy condition of the school and the bodily distortion of the boys impart in him a dismal feeling.
The thought of being a helper and abettor of such squalid practice fills his with honest disgust and indignation.
The cruelties descend upon helpless infancy fuel this rightful indignation in Nicholas, who interferes with the schoolmaster's flogging a boy named Smike and astonishes everyone in school.
Not only does Ralph persuade Nicholas' family to renounce him for the atrocities to Squeers of which he is guilty, he also betrays his niece Kate into the company of some libertine men who are clients of his and who speak of her in a most casual, lecherous, ribald and vulgar terms.
She is roused beyond all endurance by a profusion of compliments of which coarseness becomes humor and of which vulgarity softens down to the most charming eccentricity.
The mutual hatred between uncle and nephew aggravates as Nicholas overhears conversations about his sister.
The hidden feud further percolates to the surface and leads to a pitch to its malignity as he tries to rescue a girl from a marriage to which she has been impelled.
As the uncle insidiously hatches a scheme to retaliate against his nephew who has in every step of the way interceded and thwarted his plans for mercenary gains, Nicholas entwines with a cast of characters who are humorous, memorable, and true to life.
Peripheral to his molding to become a gentleman are episodes of political satire, theatrical success, courtship, family farce, and chicanery.
The most significant character is no doubt Smike, whom Nicholas saves from the hellish grip of the schoolmaster and has become his best friend.
Nicholas' unfailing love and protectiveness toward the boy accentuates his being the novel's hero, whose domestic virtues, affections, compassion, and delicacy of feelings qualifies him to his later fortune and does him justice.
NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a flamboyantly exuberant work in which Dickens wreaks the tension of his social satire to a pitch.
Details on the Yorkshire school offer such magnifying vision of the cruelty, filthiness, and despotism in the boarding schools.
Nor does he spare the rogues and the greedy, whose squeamishness he sarcastically embellishes as a common honesty and whose pride as self-respect.
NICHOLAS NICKLEBY also evokes the subtle problem of human nature in establishing boundary of one's remorse.
Although Ralph might feel no remorse in his betraying his niece to the temptation of his libertine clients, he hates them for doing what he has expected them to do.
In a sense, Nicholas is seen as the unswerving force that is determined to right the wrong of the society.
He tries to appeal to the compassion and humanity of those who have gone astray and to lead them to consider the innocent and the helpless.
Nicholas might embody energy for radicalism and ambition to challenge social injustice; his ultimate goal is the recovery of his ancestral position in the social hierarchy.
But in the effort to undertake the good deeds, he is influenced by no selfish or personal consideration but by pity for the people he helps and detestation and abhorrence of the heartless schemes.
In the same way he is determined to appeal to his uncle's humanity and not to wreak revenge on him.
But Ralph's hatred for his nephew has been fed upon his own defeat, nourished on his interference with all his schemes.
NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a sober social commentary woven with social and domestic issues.
Woven in one man's aspiration to restore family's ancestral dignity is Dickens' own musing, monologues, teachings on the soul, the life, and the moral.
The discourse at times assumes a voice of despondency, sobriety and indignation.
I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well.
I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.
This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative.
And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is.
This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.
Three years which were evidently wasted.
The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.
"Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.
He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable.
His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable.
Instead she serves as a secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph.
King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.
Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.
Then there's the whole abortion mess.
This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story.
Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.
I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal.
The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?'
His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance.
It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him.
This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.
One last thing, the villians just don't work.
They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign.
Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors?
Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone?
The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness.
Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.
I rest my case.
I'm a pretty diverse reader, so I decided to give this one a go.
It started out somewhat interesting, but then just sort of made me keep saying, "Okay...what's the point here?"
I really like Ninah, the main character, but I keep waiting for her to break free from the chains of this commune she lives in.
I guess the ending is somewhat a symbol of her doing this, but I closed the book wondering, "why did I read this?"
I grew bored with a lot of the goings on in this community and found many of the "punishments" just ridiculous.
I'm pretty open when it comes to accepting different religions, but this was just way out there for me.
Ninah's relationship with her Nanna was the neatest one in the book.
I'm glad I'm finished...now I can move on to something more fulfilling.
For decades, African-American studies scholars have left issues facing non-heterosexuals to the side.
For years, "queer" scholars have left concerns of people of color to the side.
This anthology tries to address that void.
It goes a long way in proving that black, gay academics can be just a rigorous and hardcore as white gay ones or straight black ones.
The anthology has representative numbers of men and women.
In some ways, it's a Who's Who of Black Gay Academia, including works from Cathy Cohen, Dwight McBride, and Jewelle Gomez.
Still, there is much about this book that frustrated me.
A few years ago, a study was done of black LGBTs and most respondents said they hated the term "queer," yet the academics here champion it.
Really, if "queer" is supposed to represent the four groups equally, then this book was quite lacking in its coverage of bisexuals and the transgendered.
This is surprising given famous black bisexual writers such as Alice Walker, Stuart Hall, and June Jordan.
Often "people of color" is used when only blacks are brought up; Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans barely come up in this book at all.
James Baldwin is brought up often here.
I understand that.
His writings were rigorous and often dealt with racial and sexual issues simultaneously.
Still, I kept thinking about how bell hooks once wrote that Toni Morrison gets a lot of attention when publishers won't print the works of black women that are equally as sophisticated.
James Baldwin deserves his crown in black, gay letters, but I'm concerned about him being the only one to get to wear a crown.
Several books have been printed about the many non-hetero members of the Harlem Renaissance, yet that group hardly comes up here.
James is getting a bit played out and the authors here are not helping change that tendency.
Finally, I had beef with many of the essays.
Charles Nero has great points but his essay is really two works glued together.
Can anyone really say the whiteness of New Orleans' "gay ghetto" is due to "Chasing Amy" or "Six Feet Under"?
One author could have written quickly about how he supported a gay, feminine student when that student was condemned by a masculine, heterosexual one.
Instead, he went on and on in unnecessary jargon and babble.
Kara Keeling's essay was 90% theory and 10% a discussion of Dunye's "Watermelon Woman."
Why bother to bring up the film if you're barely going to discuss it?
I wasn't really feelin' this text, but that's not to say it didn't have great aims
The book is written about an empire in the future.
I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic.
I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.
Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics.
Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.
This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand.
Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them.
This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude.
This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable.
Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.
If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization.
Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.
And Asimov is a mediocre writer.
The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed.
I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated
I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim.
The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important.
However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel.
Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel.
I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book.
I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history.
It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now.

Pirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought; he mistakes child abuse for some form of "real" child rearing.
I just read his interview in the Guardian UK.
Although it has been years since I have read this book, it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when I think about it.
I have read philosophy from classic to contemporary; I have lived in Japan and practiced Zen archery and Zen meditation - this book has only incorrect views of Western AND Eastern philosophy yet Pirgsig, to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon.
This is proof that Pirsig remains deranged.
Moreover, in the Guardian UK interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered; Pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his son's murder.
Pirsig is a perfect example of someone with Narcisstic Personality Disorder.
Pirsig's son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and/or capitulating mother.
If you are one of the poor souls who finds something "deep" in this very large pile of verbal manure then I think therapy would be money well spent
Red Lily is clearly the best book in the series.
While reading this one I could visualize the scenes.
This book would make a good movie, but I can't decide under what category it would fit into.
Although it's clearly a romance portions of the book would definitely be considered a thriller.
With all the talk of a ghost (as the rest of the series) this book it isn't a believable read as much as a fun read.
The principle question that arises from a reading of pppppppppp quot;Soul by Soul pppppppppp quot; by Walter Johnson is why was this book written?
It is touted as history, yet not only does it lack any original historical material, it also lacks any discernable historical facts.
Rather than history, pppppppppp quot;Soul by Soul pppppppppp quot; seems to be a mean-spirited, emotional tract designed to promote two fundamental ideas: 1. that white people living in the antebellum South were universally loathsome, brutish and cruel and 2. that black people living in the antebellum South were universally noble, good and abused.
To support his views, Professor Johnson strings together a loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings.
His personal contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche of the book's long deceased characters and divine their true, but unspoken, motives and thoughts.
Quite a feat for any historian!
One loses count of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using their pppppppppp quot;probing fingers pppppppppp quot; in this book.
Fortunately, in between probes, the reader can be shocked by the pppppppppp quot;killing fields of the lower South, pppppppppp quot; the pppppppppp quot;historical sexualization of black bodies, pppppppppp quot; the pppppppppp quot;slaveholders' inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of their slaves, pppppppppp quot; and the pppppppppp quot;brutish perogatives of whiteness.
pppppppppp quot; This is heavy, hate-filled stuff worthy of a TV mini-series but it is out of place in a supposedly serious history text.
I live in a former slave quarter in New Orleans.
In the antebellum period, this building and its resident slaves were, interestingly enough, owned by a free black who was financially ruined in 1863 by the Emancipation Proclamation.
As an amateur historian, I would have thought that a book about the New Orleans slave market would contain some pertinent historical facts about these markets.
What were their addresses?
What percentage of their customers were black?
What percentage were white?
How many slaves did the typical New Orleans household have?
How were they fed and clothed?
What were their working hours?
These are basic questions that should have been addressed but instead, the reader is given an emotionally charged, repetitious, boring rehash of tired, previously published material.
In short, this book, for the most part, reads like a rambling, overly long sermon.
Anyone seeking serious scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look elsewhere and should consider reading the pppppppppp quot;Slave Narratives pppppppppp quot; compiled by the Federal Writers Project, pppppppppp quot;Time on the Cross pppppppppp quot; by Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman and pppppppppp quot;The Slave Trade pppppppppp quot; by Hugh Thomas.
The first of these is a collection of interviews of former slaves performed by the W.P.A.
in the 1930's.
The latter two works contain original historical research and both deal with the facts of slavery, not the emotions
In response to the guy who said this book isn't pppppppppp quot;scientific pppppppppp quot; I say, it's as scientific as the diagnosis.
(Which is essentially a catalog of behaviors that annoy teachers, but I digress.)
There's no scientific proof that ADHD actually exists as a disorder.
Since we don't understand the brain, or why it does things, how can we assume that brain scans actually tell anyone anything?
Choosing a positive perspective about annoying behavior is a good start.
The book is worth your time, but you should also check out Hallowell or Ingersoll
I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me.
The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime.
The problem is, they didn't.
There is no crime.
I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense.
It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book.
So most of the story has no foundation.
I read this book and I think presented material is not practical in commercial applications.
In my opinion better solution is writting tests and using aspects to integrate applications.
I know this is something different from contracts, by I think contracts are to complex, hard to maintain and lacks of support for multithreaded problems.
For me another problem with contracts is problem in describing complex constraint that exists in problem domain.
For example how to describe that objects must be cloned, not passed by reference or how to check that objects holded by readonly list not change their state during operations on list?

Note to reviewers - the title of the book was a play on Hillary claiming that there was a "vast right wing conspiracy" against her husband in the Monica scandal - she and others stridently argued that the attacks on her husband were due to a right wing conspiracy (right up until the stains on the little black dress ruined everything).
This is an excellent non-polemical book that sets out the steps taken by the left to unseat Bush.
I watched from Canada and monthly visits to the US (business) and the book accurately reflects what was going on (rightly or wrongly) at the time.
It describes how a loose linkage of the media, Hollywood, pop stars, MoveOn.org (Soros), academia, Kerry spinmeisters and the intelligentsia on the left and right coasts self organized to bring down Bush and the GOP.
It is a good read and ties together many of the disparate threads into a reasonably accurate picture.
Perhaps the book can be faulted - hence only 4 stars - because there certainly was strident activity on the right too.
Limbaugh, Hannity and O'Reilly, of course, doing their thing although not with the power of the mainstream media and Hollywood behind them.
For me the interesting theme he points out is the self organizing nature of the endeavour driven by an almost irrational loathing of Bush.
Recall many Hollywood gliterrati threatening to move to Canada if Bush was elected.
I'm editorializing here - but it does seem strange that some reviewers - notably one from the UK - use this site as a platform for gross anti-US, anti-Bush remarks rather than taking the time to actually critique the book in question
Year In Sports 2005 gives you all of 2004.

This is in my opinion John Bradshaw's best book.
It encapsulates his thinking on the area of toxic shame and demonstrates how this phenomenon is at the core of compulsions, addictions, co-dependencies and our need to achieve beyond what is really necessary or serves our larger purposes.
In this volume, John Bradshaw demonstrates how toxic shame develops and leads to the breakdown of families.
He also talks about how this cycle is perpetuated through generations and actually covers a lot of ground in terms of family dynamics.
Through affirmations, working with feelings, visualizations and other techniques, the author shows the reader how to work through toxic shame.
As someone who has done the work himself, he comes across as compassionate, knowledgeable and very practical.
Sometimes I get annoyed when I read this book because of unnecessary repetition of some key concepts.
This is the explanation for my 4 rating, along with the fact that many of his books overlap each other with respect to content.
Therefore, my overall rating is that this is a solid, well-written classic that certainly deserves its best-seller status.
However, prepare yourself for some repetition and unnecessarily long examples of what he is talking about.
Erin Hunter has once again created a captivating saga about the four clans of warrior cats...who could be living in your own backyard.
This first installment begins where the last book left off.
Firestar, the protagonist of the original series, is now the leader of his Clan, and his two daughters Leafpaw and Squirrelpaw, are now the main characters, along with a great cast of new cats and some familiar faces.
Along with Brambleclaw, the son of treacherous Tigerstar, Feathertail and Stormfur, the kits of Firestar's best friend Graystripe, Brambleclaw's sister Tawnypelt, and the newbie Crowpaw, Squirrelpaw embarks on a journey to save the Clans.
Meanwhile, Leafpaw is left to try to decipher mysterious messages from Starclan.
This book is a great, fast-paced read for any cat lover or fan of the first series.
The plot is well-developed and intriguing from the first chapter
I picked this book up at my public library because I had put it on my reading list a while back when I saw that the President(!)
of the United States George Bush read it while he was on vacation too.
I went to my local cofee place and got a MEDIUM regular cofee flavored cofee but in a LARGE cup (so theres room for plenty of milk which I like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large).
Anyway I am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there.
So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning.
And he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.
Anyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought previously.
So I'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so I take it back to the library.
Now here I have to point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight.
Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when I turn the book in.
I explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.
But you can guess how this ended up.
I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was worth it).
And I never finished the book since it was ruined.
But!
I liked the parts I read "okay" and if the President likes it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I only read half.
Maybe I will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book it's missing TWO STARS if it ends well.
Lesson learned is life is not always fair but you "keep on keepin on" like they say
Have you ever done something wrong but justified it so that you wouldn't feel bad?
Have you ever seen someone else do the exact same wrong thing and condemn him?
In this story, the main character seems to believe that even when he does bad things he's still a "good guy" because "good guys" don't do bad things.
Dizzing logic, huh?
Throughout the novel, you review his senior year of high school with him.
It starts out with the story of how he got the nickname "Killer" to why it's okay for him to take illegal drugs or break a public statue.
The flashbacks of the past year are woven within the present day drama of him trying to convince a scared and angry young woman that he didn't rape her.
He won't let her leave the room until she believes it.
The ending is less than satisfactory for me.
I would much rather the main character have received retribution and the girl receive justice
As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.
The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.
The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.
There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.
Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.
If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue
The story of Anne continues with this work and the author stays true to her style, story line and character developement.
This, like the other books in this series, have a rather timeless nature about them and a comforting charm.
The reader, of course, must remember the time they were written and the style and syntax used at that time.
From my own point of view, this is great.
I enjoy this type of writing and certainly enjoy Ms. Montgomery's story telling abilities.
In this work, Anne goes off to Redman College and her adventure continues.
Recommend these books for readers of all ages.
Wish there were more works out there like it.
At 37, John Wade was Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota.
At 40, he ran for the U.S. Senate.
He was heavily favored to win.
At 41, he wasn't just beaten in the primary, he was crushed --- "loser by landslide."
What happened?
John Wade had a secret.
As secrets will, it came out at the worst possible time.
And, suddenly, he was no longer a rising star --- he was a war criminal, a killer of babies, a man to be shunned.
His secret was My Lai.
The Vietnam War is now so far from us, and American history --- especially the history of a war we lost --- is so sketchily taught, and some of you are so very young that I really ought to take a minute here and, in quick brushstrokes, relate what happened in a little Vietnam village on March 16, 1968.
Better idea: let Tim O'Brien tell it.
He arrived in Vietnam a year later, and served as a foot soldier there for a year.
Got wounded, got traumatized, the whole deal.
Here's his account: At approximately 7:30 on the morning, a company of roughly 115 American soldiers was inserted by helicopter just outside the village of My Lai.
They met no resistance.
No enemy.
No incoming fire.
Still, for the next four hours, Charlie Company killed whatever could be killed.
They killed chickens.
They killed dogs and cattle.
They killed people, too.
Lots of people.
Women, infants, teen-agers, old men.
The United States Army's Criminal Investigation Division compiled a list of 343 fatalities and an independent Army inquiry led by Lieut.
Gen. William R. Peers estimated that the death count may have exceeded 400.
At the Son My Memorial, a large tablet lists 504 names.
According to Col. William Wilson, one of the original Army investigators, "The crimes visited on the inhabitants of Son My Village included individual and group acts of murder, rape, sodomy, maiming, assault on noncombatants and the mistreatment and killing of detainees."
Eventually, after a cover-up that lasted more than a year and after the massacre made nationwide headlines, the Army's Criminal Investigation Division produced sufficient evidence to charge 30 men with war crimes.
Of these, only a single soldier --- First Lieut.
William Laws Calley, Jr. --- was ever convicted or spent time in prison.
Found guilty of the premeditated murder of "not less than" 22 civilians, Calley was sentenced to life at hard labor, but after legal appeals and sentence reductions, his ultimate jail time amounted to three days in a stockade and four and a half months in prison.
Terrible, terrible.
(And ironic: Seymour Hersh, who broke the My Lai story, now writes about the Iraq War for The New Yorker.)
But in fiction, O'Brien doesn't play judge and jury.
John Wade may have been at My Lai and done terrible things there, but he found a way to live with his shame.
And here's the remarkable thing --- Tim O'Brien bends over backward to see it Wade's way.
What I tell you now may seem like a plot "spoiler."
It's not.
"In the Lake of the Woods" is a mystery --- maybe even a thriller --- but it's totally innovative in form.
That is, we know right off that something happened.
The first question is: What happened?
And then a gloomier question: Who did it?
What we know: After the primary defeat, John Wade and his wife Kathy retreat to a cabin in the Lake of the Woods, a part of Northern Minnesota so remote that there's nothing but water and islands between it and Canada.
Thirty-six hours later, Kathy disappears.
Did she flee?
Did she drown?
Did her husband --- reliving his Vietnam experience --- kill her and dump her body into the lake?
Not easy questions.
And O'Brien doesn't answer them: "I tried to make each hypothesis plausible.
John may have killed Kathy.
Or Kathy may have run off with someone else.
Or maybe she simply drowned.
Or got lost in that vast wilderness.
I believed in each hypothesis as I wrote it.
I inserted evidence to support each hypothesis --- just as life itself gives us contradictory evidence about a great many things.
But in the end, it's all a mystery, insoluble, beyond certainty."
And to make it more mysterious, O'Brien tells the story from multiple perspectives.
Offers testimony from many people.
Cites historical documents.
And then amps up the uncertainly by giving Wade a hobby --- magic.
And maybe that's what it comes down to --- an ungainly kid, an abusive father, a need for approval that never got satisfied.
As O'Brien writes: "A fat little kid doing magic in front of a stand-up mirror.
'Hey, kiddo, that's a good one,' his father could've said, but for reasons unknown, reasons mysterious, the words never got spoken.
He had wanted to be loved.
And to be loved he had practiced deception.
He had hidden the bad things.
He had tricked up his own life.
Only for love.
Only to be loved."
Too simple?
A clue that takes you away from the solution?
Could be: O'Brien is that good.
(He won the National Book Award for "Going After Cacciato".
The New York Times named The Things They Carried as one of the best books of the year in 1990 --- and chose "In the Lake of the Woods" for that list four years later.)
This much is sure: You start "In the Lake of the Woods" expecting one kind of book and quickly get another, darker, scarier book.
You find yourself thinking "God, this is awful," even as you read faster and faster.
You cringe at what Wade might have done, wince for what might have been done to him.
And, as he comes apart, so do you.
This is a harrowing book, as grown-up as it gets.
It's a great story, masterfully told.
And more: It draws you in, demands your opinion.
And then it demands your honest opinion --- because you have your secrets too, don't you
I borrowed this from my sister-in-law to read.
It is the first Barr book I have read.
I did not like it because of several reasons.
First of all, THE VULGAR LANGUAGE was too much.
One can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter.
Second, it was so mundane for a mystery.
The writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in Yellowstone National Park.
Someone needs to give me a book of Barr's to prove that she can write an interesting book using words that are common to our daily language instead of trash talk.
(By that I mean words one would use in professions of integrity.)
I will probably write a few APA-format papers while getting a Master's Degree on-line and I think for my limited use, "APA the Easy Way" is the right product for me.
I agree with other reviewers that if you do a lot of writing in the APA style, you may need the complete manual.
However, I have the complete manual and since I bought "APA the Easy Way," I don't think I will ever need to use the full-size manual again.
I especially like that it gives step-by-step instructions on how to do all of the "set-ups" for MS-Word.
Every book by Jodi Picoult grabs you by the heart and doesn't let go.
Mercy stands out from all the rest.
You will not forget this book or the people in it for a long time
2 stars for decent writing (at least a decent translation), for an intriguing start, and for the occasional appearance of a melancholy dwarf.
That's pretty much it.
Negative stars aplenty for the protagonists -- Coy and Tanger (I listened to NC on 13 endless tapes, so perhaps am misspelling their names).
The tortured metaphors they speak, think, and by which they -- and their insipid adventures -- are continually described, bore to tears.
Aside from an occasional scrape between Coy and the aforementioned dwarf or his boss, all of the action in NC clusters at the beginning (promisingly so, I'll grant) and the end (all wimper, no bang) of this novel.
As a salty seadog once said (no doubt anticipating this novel), "Ahoy matey, thar.
She blows!"
It may sound as though I am damning this book with faint praise, but I believe that with a subject as complicated as anti-western feeling there are few better places to begin than with a good conversation opener.
Written in clear non-academic language, Buruma and Margalit have written a book-length essay which further elaborates on the article which they published several years ago in the New York Review of Books.
The point of the project is to posit a hypothesis on the roots of anti-western feeling and use that to draw open the discussion as to how the gap can be repaired.
I notice that the original article sparked much less disappointment than the book.
There is something about the translation to book form which implies a level of completion or comprehensiveness that an essay by itself cannot achieve.
You will find that most reviewers (myself included) had a list of things that we missed in their overview.
These omissions felt serious to me, but I notice that the lists have very little in common.
It is truly not possible to please everyone or include everything, so perhaps it is just as well that they did not try.
If you already have an adament point of view in this discussion, then this book may well irritate you.
Buruma and Margalit clearly do their best to be as objective as possible, given their own cultural bias.
If, however, you are like me and mostly have a clear view about your own lack of answers then you will probably find this a valuable reading experience.
Since reading it, I lent the book to a good friend (sorry, publishers!)
and we have not been able to stop discussing the points that it raised.
Quite an accomplishment, in my opinion, for a self-described short history.
Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.
Did Cornwell even write this one herself?
If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.
Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened.
However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct
I read this as a thirteen year old boy and enjoyed it.
A re-read twenty years later gave me a different perspective.
MacLeans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best.
There are also a few glaring errors that I am surprised that his editor did not pick up on, two of note: Shaffer (supposedly from Montana) is credited with a Mid-West accent??
Montana is far west not 'mid' west.
Secondly, Nazi helicopters?
This is just plain sloppy.
MacLean should have known much better.
This one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy.
For a better read of MacLeans better works I reccomend; HMS Ulysess and Bear Island.
The characters are far more credible and provide a better story by far.
A poor effort by Mr MacLean
If one approaches this book with a view to learning Music Theory, one would be slightly disappointed.
The author brushes right through the fundamentals but that is to be expected from an outline book of this type.
All in all, I think this book will come in useful after I've learned Music and need to review theory from time to time.
Great book though
Ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up.
I first bought the book, 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on, so i bought the audiobook (5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on).
Now im stephen kings No1 fan and have loved the majority of his work, the talisman for me was a fantastic bolt on to the dark tower quest.
So naturally i thought this would be the same.
The book is one of the slowest drawn out books ive ever came accross, not a patch on previous work.
I forced myself through the book expecting more, and im sorry to say this one doesnt deliver on any horror, excitment etc, do yourself a favour, get a tin of paint and watch it dry - more happens in that and at a much quicker pace than it does in this book.
This book is for die hard fans only... but even diehards will find this a chore
This is a fine series so when I began this volume I had hopes that it would be of the same standard as the others.
Ms. Haney has a genuine gift in giving readers the "texture" of everyday life in imperial Rome (at the time of Vespasian and Titus in this one).
The dialogue and the characters are both engaging.
So what went wrong?
A young girl appears to speak with Falco believing someone in her family wants to kill her.
And away we go, on and on and on!
I was weary by the time I got to the rather flat conclusion and felt that a good editing would have been most helpful; the length of this book (326 pages) really cannot support so thin a story.
I was left wondering what had happened and if somehow I had missed something as there was so little going on
I love this book!!
I've owned it for about a year now, but just got it back after a very long visit to my mother-in-law.
(3 months) She loved the book also and didn't want to give it back!
She bought one of her own!
Thank goodness!
I think she got tired of reading the recipes over the phone to me!
lol!
Anyways great book, lots of information.
Also great for what ever size machine you have.
Does small (1lb), Med.
(1 1/2lbs.)
and large (2lbs).
for each recipe.
There was not a single poem I didn't like, and most of them I loved.
Her poems seem to touch upon the core of things.
I feel comfortable with saying I think she is in the same league as Mary Oliver, Hafiz, Stafford, And Rumi.
I was very excited about receiving this book, by the way big upps to lupo997 for getting my book to me in a timely fashion.
After reviewing the book further I realized it was like Touched by an Angel, and I don't like that show at all, but I decided to read it anyway cause it looked good.
That was a mistake, the character's were two dimensional and truly unbelieveable.
In the first story - Rainmaker - The Professor was sooo in love with Hailey he didn't care about getting killed or putting his own child's life in danger - come on now.
He would rather see his blind daughter killed for this woman he barely knows.
I didn't even read the second story, maybe I'll come back to that.
The third story was totally ridiculous as well.
Paris is so sick of Russell - he doesn't have a job, money and no ambition, yet she stays with him.
He cheats on her, she has the broads up in her house and sells them Mary Kay!!
Yet she stays with him.
He has given her an STD!!!
She stays with him!!!
She doesn't even like making love to him.
During all of this nonsense her fi-one boss is pushing up on her, and she resists.
She won't cheat on her man.
What!!!!
If you like reading fairy tales then this is the book for you.
For everyone else who likes a little believable drama in their fiction - DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!
Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America.
Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air.
Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour.
He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans.
Sean - stop labeling everybody.
Every American has their own opinion
Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.
Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment.
Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.
I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise.
In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s.
But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.
The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page 17: "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."
That passage is good.
The rest of the book is depressing and confusing.
Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."
I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth.
It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better.
The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.
Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.
ERIC CARLE'S ILLUSTRATIONS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND UNUSUAL.
THE SIMPLY STATED STORY IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE VERY YOUNG TO SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN.
THE AUTHOR INCORPORATES MATH AND SCIENCE IN A BOOK YOU WILL WISH TO READ AGAIN AND AGAIN.
THE STORY WAS A FAVORITE FOR THE CHILDREN, AGES TWO TO FIVE AT THE LOCAL LIBRARY'S STORY HOUR, AND IT WAS A FAVORITE OF MINE TO READ TO THEM.
Aside from the 1958 Championship Game and the 1968 Super Bowl, the actual football games got very short shrift.
The 1964 Championship Game didn't even get a MENTION!
Whole years are virtually ignored.
Very, very little discussion of Unitas' career and his impact on the game: mostly just anecdotes about family, friends, and teammates, and way too much space devoted to post-mortem comments from same.
I think I learned way more about Johnny Sample and Gino Marchetti and Jim Parker from this book than I learned about Unitas.
And that's not saying much.
There's a lot of padding in this book but precious little information.
And a lot of the anecdotes will be familiar if you're a football fan.
Wait for the paperback if you're a Unitas devotee; otherwise don't bother.
It certainly sounded exciting.
Unfortunately, it's mostly a bunch of long winded articles on vague ideas that you've already thought of a hundred times.
That's not to say that the ideas aren't important.
I was simply expecting something a bit more focused by an author willing to take some risks.
On the bright side, the book won't become dated for quite some time.
Good Transaction, Thank you
I was not impressed with this book.
It is just basic stuff.
I would have expected a more sophisticated analyis of financials from this publisher
If you want a biased and misleading account of the Arab war against Israel, this ought to satisfy you.
Shlaim tells us that Jabotinsky, in discussing Zionism explained that "if the cause is just, justice must triumph."
I think Jabotinsky made a very good point here.
You see, human beings will, if given the chance, tend to buy land in the places they wish to live in.
The ones who can make best use of the land and wish to do so will be the high bidders for the land.
If injustice consists of stealing that land from them and justice consists of letting them buy the land and keep it (which they will wish to do if they are offered only low prices for it), then it is easy to see what the triumph of justice would mean here.
In particular, it would mean a prosperous Israel and a triumph for Zionism.
Shlaim appears to have missed all this.
To him, Zionism is unjust.
And to him, the triumph of terror and theft is both forthcoming and desirable.
He tells us that a new independent Levantine Arab state "is inevitable."
I disagree.
It may be likely.
But it would serve no purpose.
It would not help Jews, Arabs, or others.
Its only purpose would be to damage Israel.
The people of such a state do not as yet have an independent language, religion, culture, cuisine, or foreign policy.
So I think there is still hope that sanity may prevail here.
Shlaim also tells us that this new Arab state will be "weak, demilitarized, and territorially divided."
Is it just possible that this, if true, provides even more reasons why neither side might want to create it at all?
And could that make the appearance of this state even less inevitable?
Or at least less desirable?
And the author also explains that both sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict will have to make "painful compromises," and that Jerusalem will have to be "the subject of hard bargaining."
Really?
Is having peace and prosperity with reasonable borders a painful compromise?
For either side?
Of course not.
Shlaim is kidding us if he expects us to believe that war, poverty, and destruction are somehow less painful.
Had Shlaim been writing about France and Germany, we'd have seen at once that the whole viewpoint is nonsense.
He'd have been telling us that the German National Socialists needed an independent state in France, either to replace all of France or part of it.
He would have laughingly dismissed French claims on the basis of the entire idea of France being unjust!
He'd have sternly explained that a German National Socialist state in France was both desirable and inevitable.
And he would have discussed the necessary "painful compromises" for both sides and the "hard bargaining" about Paris.
There are plenty of reasonable books about the Arab war against Israel.
This isn't one of them
This book is atrocious.
It is THE worst book I have read in the last decade.
A 10 year old could have done better.
The plot gets more ridiculous as the book progresses, the characters act unbelievably and it is amazing that someone can actually get paid to write such garbage.
The only plus was that I got it out of the library and didn't pay for it
I have just finished my sophomore year in college and in my first course relating to information and computer security we used this book.
I would recommend it to anybody who is interested in getting into the rapidly expanding field of infosec.
As they say with the CISSP certification, it is an "inch deep and a mile wide".
This book covers many, many topics however it is really intended to be an introduction to these concepts.
It gave me a good overview of information security concepts and prepared me for senior level Infosec courses as well as preparation for graduate school.
*Note that preparation for the CISSP exam would require much more then just this book
Two main comments.
Firstly, the book is mistitled or I misread the meaning of the title and I would be delighted to return it.
This is a book devoted primarily on how to make your dog perform "tricks" with much on showmanship.
I have no interest in that but I do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master's care of their puppy and mature dog.
Problems handlers encounter in "greeting" of your dog with other dogs and people.
Secondly, the book, as written, talks down to the reader and unless you have had some professional experience with dogs, you feel very unqualified to read on.
I felt intimidated by it.
This was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author's task management system.
This was the beginning of the "scientific management" line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book.
The essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time.
He also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success.
Still, a reader shouldn't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources.
The book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers
The self-improvement books How to Win Friends and Influence People and Talking the Winner's Way are both way superior to this short book.
Most of what you read is basically review if you've ready other similar books.
And what's present doesn't pack enough substance or pppppppppp quot;how to pppppppppp quot; to make it really worth your time.
About half-way through the book, Gabor started presenting fresh ideas.
The problem, however, is that it was half-way through the book.
Not a bad read, but there's so much better.
If you happen across it one day on the street, it won't do any harm to read it.
But I can't recommend paying money for something you already know, or can get for a better deal
If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you.
It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect".
Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him.
At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation.
Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.
Since when was God in need of forgiveness?
Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God?
I have no words in describing this book.
It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person.
Why do bad things happen to good people?
Wrong question.
There are no good people in the world in the first place. "
for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin.
The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!!
Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous.
I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book.
It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them.
Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY"
This is a badly written, repetitive and self-serving account, largely, of the foolishness of pppppppppp quot;portflio insurance.
pppppppppp quot; That things which are pppppppppp quot;just like pppppppppp quot; something else may not be so in reality, and that magic fixes in the market (which after all fly in the face of the rational-expectations/efficient-market hypotheses which often are built into the view of the market being relied on) I guess needs to be pointed out regularly, since hope of quick, uninformed, and painless fixes seem to reoccur with each new wave of financial charlatans and the greed they feed on.
Jacobs does point out such problems for a particular, rather bizarre episode, and suggests, not too coherently, that such pppppppppp quot;scams pppppppppp quot; are still prevalent.
However, He does this in a horribly repetitive and self-laudatory way that is not really very clearly argued
Anyone who wishes to build a Japanese tea room either in the garden or attached to their house could do well to start with this book.
You can also use this book to design accents for a single room, or to craft an entire house.
It was written by a German architect who lived in Japan several decades ago and carefully measured surving older buildings as well as studying architecture there.
While there are more detailed books in Japanese, this may well still be the best available book in English
THE BAND: James Hetfield (lead vocals, guitar), Kirk Hammett (guitars), Lars Ulrich (drums pppppppppp percussion), and new member Jason Newsted (bass) formerly of Flotsam And Jetsam (replacing Cliff Burton, R.I.P.).
THE DISC: (1988) 9 tracks clocking in at approximately 65 minutes.
Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, band pictures, one 'gavel' drawing containing band member faces, and thank you's.
This is Metallica's 4th studio album.
All songs written by Hetfield, Hammett, Ulrich and/or Newsted.
Recorded at One On One Studios, Los Angeles, CA.
This would be Flemming Rasmussen's last album produced with the band (Bob Rock would follow).
The Japanese (import) version contains a bonus track - a Diamond Head cover, "The Prince".
Label - Elektra.
COMMENTS: "...And Justice For All" was the last classic Metallica album of the 80's.
It was also their final attempt at thrash metal (once the 90's rolled around and producer Bob Rock entered the picture, the band took a more "mainstream" metal approach).
The majority of songs are long with complex riffs... borderline progressive.
Let me first say that for years, this disc sat on my shelf.
I thought it was over-produced; I didn't like Ulrich's snare drum (sounded cheap and tinny) or his double bass (sounded shallow and metallic - partly due to a coin taped to the drum skin where the foot pedal hit); Newsted's bass was nonexistent (the standard explanation for this combines Newsted's absence from the mixing sessions where he could have voiced his opinion, and the lingering issue of his "newness" within the band following the death of Burton); there were three songs that I just could not get into ("Eye Of The Beholder", "The Shortest Straw" and lightning fast "Dyers Eve"); and the articles I read about the 3 original band members hazing and not accepting newcomer Newsted was infuriating... call if fun, call it pranks, call it cruel - Newsted simply did not deserve this kind of treatment.
Newsted (or anyone else who took the job) had two choices - put up with the crap or leave.
From the outside looking in, Burton's loss was tragic, but the way Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett handled the situation afterwards seemed uncalled for.
As far as "...And Justice For All" is concerned though, it's taken a decade to grow on me and finally realize there are some brilliant songs here.
In my opinion, "One" is one of Metallica's finest songs in their entire catalog.
"One" has an awesome slow beginning, tells a great story of an injured soldier, and ends in fine metal thrash form (not to mention one of the more memorable MTV videos)... all in all featuring great guitar work (intro, rhythm and solos).
"Blackened" is an underrated gem of an opener.
"To Live Is To Die" is the other masterpiece (almost 10 minutes long) - riffs and spoken words written by Cliff Burton (his last written testament) - this song has great riffs and 7 minutes of jamming before any vocals... reminiscent of something taken right off "Master Of Puppets".
The title track also resembles something from "Puppets".
"...And Justice For All" chart success - hitting #6 on Billboard's "Top 200 Albums" from 1988, as well as the song "One" hitting #35 on Billboard's Hot 100.
There's good and bad here... this album is still considered a classic and essential.
If not only for the songs "One", "Blackened" and "To Live Is To Die" (4 stars).
If you want to get an excellent idea about the history of the domestic interior, this is the book for you.
Every type of dwelling is to be found, with exquisite detail.
From the very simple, to the palatial, one finds great delight in these wonderful watercolors.
Culled from the domestic interiors of Europe, the Continent, Russia and America, these historic records give the reader an extrodinary glimpse into the past.
It is an accurate record of the most minute details, from the floors to the paintings on the walls.
Scholarly enough for students of Interior Design?
Yes; but why should they have all the fun
Bought this book hoping for a comprehensive resource of information on hiring a nanny.
Boy were we disappointed.
As was mentioned in another post - the book is nothing more than a glorified outline, and half of the book is copies of the forms that are on the disk, which forms by the way are in .pdf form and are not even fillable.
This story gives me hope in mankind again.
Despite the horrendous abuse, this woman gave herself -- all of herself -- to save a child from the torment she experienced.
I wish there were more people like Torey Hayden in this world.
I can only hope that I can touch lives in the way Ms. Hayden has.
This book will open eyes to the terrors of abuse that does, indeed, occur in this world, despite the fact that we would like to close our eyes to it.
It also demonstrates the hope that victims can overcome and the need for us to step up to the plate to end this war of terror
Once again John Patterson has created a master thriller in the Alex Cross series.
Character development is well done as is the plot line.
One can't help but be drawn into the story and feeling the tension.
This is another winner
Sorry guys, I looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media.
The graphics of the book are truly beautiful.
The recipes however, hmmm, try again.
I followed a simple recipe for Apple Crisp and got a bad result.
I now go to respected standard cookbooks for my Apple Crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great.
Really people, the recipes are NOT the stuff of greatness.
Graphics?
Great.
Photography?
Great?
Recipes?
You have got to be kidding
'The Regulators' is not quite on the literary level of 'Desperation,' but that makes it more fun in a way, especially as it's less preachy.
I liked that 'The Regulators' adds a little more information about the mysterious Tak.
Here we see a more terribly playful, oddly fastidious, and possibly younger Tak who loves spaghetti, chocolate milk, westerns, and Cassie Stiles.
And while most of the characters of 'The Regulators' are flatter than those of 'Desperation,' 'The Regulators' gives us a glimpse of what some inhabitants of Desperation might have been like before Tak possessed them, particularly Audrey and Collie who were never shown "pre-Tak" in 'Desperation.
I really like this book it was well written and enjoyable.The characters in it were very interesting to read about.
I like the way that Imogene and Maxine stayed friends all the way through the book.
The two girls really seemed to bring out the best in each other.Maxine never thought Imogene was crazy because of the strange things that happened.
Maxine just believed her and helped her through everything.
Overall it was a well written book with very good characters and it showed what friendship really is
Girl Sleuth is a must-read especially for the over-50 Nancy Drew fan.
Rehak's research is remarkable.
However, on p. 47, Rehak has Mildred Augustine headed west to the University of Iowa from her hometown of Ladora, Iowa.
She would have headed east.
I have been teaching 30 years in the school district that now includes students from the town of Ladora and have my own degree from Iowa.
I've traveled Highway 6 between Ladora and Iowa City many, many times.
Marcia Nilles What Cheer I
The most depressing thing about a book like this is not the outrageously inaccurate content, but, based on the high ratings and adulatory comments by other reviewers, that most people actually believe this drivel.
How can we possibly form an effective energy policy when the citizenry are not only uninformed but ill-informed?
The answer is that we cannot.
I will not bother to go through a detailed criticism, not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it, but because, in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in, no one would believe it.
Today, the "truth" depends much more on one's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence.
this book blew my ballz.
it was possibly the worst book i have ever read in my entire life.
although i am usually sleepless in seattle, i found myself falling asleep each time i tried to read it.
i advise no one to ever read this godforsaken book
I have looked high and low through countless new age books and Voyagers was the first book that really fofilled my sense of longing.
After every other book I had read, I found myself still searching, but after Voyagers, I no longer needed to search.
That is not to say that everything you ever needed to know can be found in this book, it is more of an introduction to a larger body of work where you can find information on everything you wanted to know, and then some.
If you are genuinely looking for answers, then don't take my word for it, or any one else's for that matter... just read it for yourself and decide for yourself if it is right for you.
2 stars for decent writing (at least a decent translation), for an intriguing start, and for the occasional appearance of a melancholy dwarf.
That's pretty much it.
Negative stars aplenty for the protagonists -- Coy and Tanger (I listened to NC on 13 endless tapes, so perhaps am misspelling their names).
The tortured metaphors they speak, think, and by which they -- and their insipid adventures -- are continually described, bore to tears.
Aside from an occasional scrape between Coy and the aforementioned dwarf or his boss, all of the action in NC clusters at the beginning (promisingly so, I'll grant) and the end (all wimper, no bang) of this novel.
As a salty seadog once said (no doubt anticipating this novel), "Ahoy matey, thar.
She blows!"
Diane Ravitch discusses the development of censorship in textbooks and on tests that has been slowly integrated into the educational system.
She speaks about the rights of the First Amendment pertaining to free speech, and provides a detailed history of how censorship has become a part of the textbooks and tests that have been developed.
The book is informative and thought- provoking.
Ravitch starts by discussing the creation of bias and sensitivity boards and how they have come to dominate what can and cannot be said in certain literature for education.
She goes on to talk about certain topics and words that must not be used.
This list is ridiculous and completely irrational.
Due to left and right wing intervention, almost everything of interest has been stripped from the educational requirements.
Ravitch discusses in great detail the effort of both sides and what their motives were in demanding that certain changes be made in textbooks and tests.
She goes further to detail the goals of each side and how they were met.
She argues that such censorship keeps children from learning historically accurate facts because adults would rather paint a picture of Utopia and keep children from feeling any emotions.
Ravitch presents a good, convincing argument with concrete reasoning to support her views.
To the best of my knowledge and research, she has done a great job at gathering accurate information about what has been going on in publishing companies and the struggles they have faced from bias and sensitivity reviews, feminists, minorities, and other groups.
Her reasoning is inductively strong with few logical fallacies.
Occasionally, Ravitch begs the question through circular reasoning and attacks the motives of some publishing companies.
Although she has clear concise points, Ravitch intermittently distorts the timeline within chapters, which is slightly confusing.
Her claims are logically consistent and her argument seems complete with all the relevant evidence presented.
Throughout research, Ravitch manages to also find publishing companies who have tried to change standards and incorporate more accurate facts in textbooks and what happens to these companies when they go against the bias and sensitivity rules.
The argument Ravitch presents is a historically accurate account of censorship in textbooks, fairly and effectively arguing her point.
Today, more and more people are beginning to notice what is going on with censorship in textbooks and are speaking up and taking steps toward removing these censors.
Textbooks are becoming more accurate, and classic literature reintroduced to the classroom.
Ravitch calls for the dispersion of the "language police" and a return to the "freedom of speech" that everyone has the right to exercise.
Hmm, quite a disappointment, especially after splurging on the hardcover edition.
Set as a kind of "Rockies Rear Window," this is one slow story.
Endless pages of crazy-making when I'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through.
Finally skipped ahead to finish the book.
I had really looked forward to Angels Fall, too :( If you are a Roberts fan, don't spend the money on the hardcover, wait for the paperback, go to the library, or borrow from a friend.
Not worth the price.
This book is so densely packed with miniscule details and examples that the information's significance becomes blurred, if not obsolete.
The authors show they are very knowledgable on the subject, but they fail to analyze the information they present.
The reader is left to interpret the meaning of details and ponder why they are included.
The authors also use repetitive examples that become tiring and ineffective.
The only minutely important information is presented in the topic sentences of each paragraph, and the book can be reasonably well understood just by reading the introductory sentences.
While this book could be a treasure house for someone researching the relationship between manors and their respective villages, the average reader's attention is never captured.
Students, beware!
Before embarking on an excruciatingly dull explaination of medieval village life, reconsider your other options of reading material.
(One option is another book by these authors that has gotten better reveiws.
Sometimes advice coming from a parent is even better when it's reinforced by an outside source.
This book does just that.
It's practical and yet compassionate toward the sometimes awkward feelings young girls deal with.
Boston is trembling under the shadow of a serial murderer with a notably gruesome method of dispatching his victims - brutal, savage rape, an obviously knowledgeable, skillful removal of the uterus while the victim still lives with the coup de grace coming as a slashed throat and severing of the carotid artery!
Little wonder the media has awarded him the moniker "The Surgeon".
In the course of their investigations, detectives Thomas Moore and Jane Rizzoli discover an earlier case with a virtually identical MO in Savannah in which the murderer, Andrew Capra, was ultimately killed by a stalwart would-be victim who fought back and shot him before he could finish the job!
They are startled to discover that the surviving victim, Dr Catherine Cordell, is a noted cardiac surgeon currently practicing in a major Boston hospital, and beyond all belief in the possibility of coincidences, she appears to be the target of the now active killer!
Once again, Gerritsen has unerringly brought her intimate knowledge of medicine and the hospital milieu to the table.
But, contrary to what one might fairly expect from Gerritsen's past work, has successfully served up a compelling investigative police procedural which lovingly details the forensics, the pathology, the profiling and the gut-wrenching detail in the relentless task force style search for a psychopathic serial murderer!
Several superbly paced sub-plots are inextricably woven into one another as the story unfolds - Cordell's slow recovery from the assault she endured two years ago and her halting re-integration into life and the hospital work force; Jane Rizzoli's bristly temperament as the lone Boston female homicide detective and her work-life struggles against the "old boy" attitude of the police force; Thomas Moore's extended grieving period over the untimely loss of his dearly loved wife and the difficulties he faces as he recognizes his entirely inappropriate blossoming romantic feelings for Catherine Cordell; the task force style investigation of "The Surgeon" and his relationship with the long dead Georgia killer; and, Cordell's daily life in the cardiac ward and the emergency room of the hospital and the brilliantly described relationship she maintains with her working partner, Dr Peter Falco.
Not only does Gerritsen handle all of this with skill and aplomb but, with every passing page and each successful murder, she ratchets up the suspense as we realize the killer is taunting the police, honing his skills and reaching for Catherine Cordell as his ultimate target.
Yet he constantly remains one step ahead of the investigation.
A great addition to the library if, like me, you love your easy reading page-flipping thrillers!
Paul Weis
I've been a fan of Heinlein's SF for just about as long as I've been an SF fan at all (somewhere around thirty-five years).
But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago, it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether.
The fiction is pretty good (although even that isn't Heinlein's best).
But to describe the nonfiction accurately, I'd have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway.
For the most part, the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike.
Though I respect _Starship Troopers_, it's never going to be my favorite Heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of "fascism" -- and I'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection.
And mind you, it's not because I disagree with Heinlein's opinions; it's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed.
Some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic.
(At least in his fiction, he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short, to grok them.
Not here, boy.)
Heinlein (who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions.
But his own attempt at philosophy, as represented here in e.g.
"The Pragmatics of Patriotism", is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy I've ever seen.
Then, too, people who knew Heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor, he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him.
Well, he's certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesn't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head.
Even in the unlikely event that I thought he were _right_, I wouldn't find this a very helpful approach.
Perhaps more surprisingly, his popular writings on _science_ aren't very good.
Asimov's reputation as the "great explainer" is in no danger here.
This volume is second only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was.
When I want Heinleinian company, I'll stick to D.B.
Davis, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, and (maybe) Lazarus Long.
And when I want to read some humane nonfiction by an SF master, I'll still turn to Asimov.
I credit Heinlein with three magisterial novels, several imperfect-but-great ones, and a good number of brilliant short stories.
But the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer
GODS AND GENERALS is an extremely well done and fascinating book.
The author, Jeff Shaara, did an excellent job of interpreting the characters.
His task was a difficult one because his father's book, THE KILLER ANGELS is a classic in the chronicles of Civil War stories.
This book precedes the one written by his father.
GODS AND GENERALS takes the reader to the beginning of the Civil War and through many of the battles.
The major players in the story are Winfield Scott, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Winfield Hancock and Lawrence Chamberlain.
The career biographies of these famous men were striking.
After reading of their early lives and service experiences, it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the Union Army.
They were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends.
I listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by Dick Estell.
He brought the characters to life by his narration.
This book is well worth the time and truly is an unforgettable part of our history.
After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books, reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring I guess this is where the adventure end for me..
This collection of shorts narrating the lives of the inhabitants of 44 Scotland Street - a Edinburgh neighborhood, full of quirky characters, both lovable and unlovable - is quaint and entertaining, striking a cord of truth in the mind and heart, like many of Smith's stories.
A great addition to those previously delighted with Smith - for new readers I recommend The No.
#1 Ladies' Detective Agency
The Case for Marriage makes arguments supportive of Pres.
Bush's policies on marriage.
However, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post (1/26/5) reports that Maggie Gallagher was paid over $40,000 by the Bush Administration to write columns and a "private" report supporting its $300 million HHS marriage initiative.
Mr. Kurtz reports that Ms. Gallagher filed a column apologizing to her readers, writing "I should have disclosed a government contract when I later wrote about the Bush marriage initiative.
I would have, if I had remembered it."
She also states she was "aware vaguely" that her work was federally funded.
It must be vaguely hard to remember being paid $40,000.
Bad memory, vagueness, national column: what will we say to the children?
I wonder who paid Ms. Gallagher to write this book
Petra of all places.
Supernatural protection, persecution, on ad naseum.
The one drug on, and on, and on, and on ......
Same tired story, persecution by Carpathia a lame attempt at evil incarnate and his lackies.
Sorry..
I think the series denegrates Christianity rather then exalting it.
I've read all 12 and found it morose and condemning.
The opposite of how I view Christianity is.
I am nearly finished with this book - I haven't been this mesmerized by a book in forever!
I would certainly recommend it
Said gives good insight into politics, especially in the middle east.
I didn't enjoy the literature section as much because I wasn't familiar with the authors.
I was interested in the plot and characters for about half the book.
After that it seemed that little new information was added, or the little that was new came in the midst of much repetition.
There were so many different characters, and we had to hear the separate reactions of each of them to bits of news.
The structure of the tale reminded me of the way a police procedural might be played out on TV
Were someone to write a biography of Carl Hiassin in fifty years it is hard to imagine that he or she wouldn't focus on the author's latest triumph, Skinny Dip.
It is one of his seminal achievements.
The book simply shines with humor, well drawn characters, action and as usual everyone gets their just desserts.
It is also one of his smoothest rides.
One gets the feeling that Hiassin was very confident in every sentence that he wrote.
Here is an overview that will stimulate readers' interest Hiassin's.
The book opens with Chaz trying to kill his wife by flinging her over the rail of their cruise ship, but by some twists and turns and luck Joey survives long enough to be rescued.
Much of the rest of the book circles around the characters interactions and relationships as Joey and her team pursue vengeance.
By the midpoint of the novel Chaz is already an emotional wreck and it doesn't look like Joey is about to let up any time soon.
The moral backbone of the novel is twofold.
One is the pitting of the Everglades Forest and her defenders against big business and her pollutants.
The Everglades is quickly turning from pristine swamp into another type of ecosystem entirely and many Floridians want to prevent the remaining land from being destroyed, which means millions of dollars loss to the big agricultural business.
Hiassin's two segments on the real life plight of this swamp standout a bit apart from the book, but also lends it a feeling of seriousness.
And two is the pitting of criminals against victims who aren't going to take it anymore.
Hiassin is at his when he reapetedly refers to the attempted murder as an insult to Joey.
As most survivors of violent crime can ascertain there is a severe indignity attached to one's helplessness.
There are six main characters in the book: Joey and her horny husband Chaz, Joey's rescuer Mick who is a kind and eccentric ex-policeman who lives alone on an island, Joey's brother, a rich expatriate who raises sheep in New Zealand, Mr. Hammernut, the owner of a large agricultural empire and Tool, the books muscled goon who undergoes a moral transformation.
The small group of sub-characters is entertainingly populated in part with a hermit who lives in the swamp, a street-tough hairdresser, a slap-happy senior and a cowardly lawyer.
Though similar elements live in many of Hiassin's works his books never feel like he has used a formula to create them more easily.
This can't be said for all or most of crime writers and should be accredited to Hiassin's love for storytelling, his skill as a plot weaver and his ability to evoke so many different emotions.
In this line of thought this reviewer took note of the characters subtle (except for Tool) character changes throughout the book.
Joey for example seemed learn a bit more restraint as she calmed down a little and the same can be said even for characters that have appeared in some of Hiassin's previous works (Mick).
Hiassin has never been a fan of superficial materialism, but the issue is slightly complicated by Skinny Dip and does not simply fall into place along character axes.
While the villains all crave money some of the heroes are loaded too.
Joey maintains a very frugal existence considering her $ 13 million trust, but her brother spends lavishly.
Joey's rescuer on the other hand lives on a disability check.
One may wonder if the only difference between Chaz and his wife is that she never had to work or hustle for a buck, but there is one other way in which the enemies contrast and that is the way they treat their associates.
Chaz is continuously scrambling for something and in his desperation - be it for sex, money, or escape - uses other people as tools rather than relating to them as equals.
On the other hand, Joey has a good sense of humor and she enjoys the companionship of her pals.
Like most of Hiassin's work this book is not an overly violent one.
Although it begins with an attempted murder, the event is quite peaceful.
There is no struggle, no blood and the victim, Joey, does not die.
After reading Skinny Dip I immediately lent it to my best friend Katie who has not been able to put it down.
So, potential readers be warned: Like Katie you may not be able to get any work done for a day or two, but the time is not wasted on Hiassin's best work to date.
One comes away gaining not only pleasant memories of laughs and smiles, but also the feeling that one has poured one more drop into the bucket of our minds that we must fill in order to make this world a better place.
In short, Carl Hiassin puts us in touch with the good guys in ourselves
Perhaps this book appeared to be a futuristic medical thriller when it first came out, but now it seems like a bad 1950s horror movie.
The story involves brain surgery gone bad, with a mix of artificial intelligence and mind control.
The end of the story was very predictable and played out exactly as I suspected from the very beginning of the book.
Peter Mayle's breakthrough book remains the classic Mediterranean travel narrative.
An elegant and witty writer, Mayle set the standard for travel writers of the 1990s, and he's difficult to equal to the present day.
Reading and re-reading "A Year in Provence" is like coming home again and again to a faithful friend.
Mayle is absolutely superb!
The next best thing to actual travel.
Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure.
There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published "Huckleberry Finn," along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors.
This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.
The kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s.
His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn).
As Twain later wrote in "Puddn'head Wilson, "if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it."
After he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he'd hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad.
Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous.
His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.
The material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices.
Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty.
(You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked "the once renowned and vigorously hated" Frances Trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)
The material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff.
As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative.
In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better
This book is poorly written.
Although it is one of the most update-to-date versions out ther, it seems muddled and repetitive.
I was surprised at the number of grammatical mistakes and errors.
Clearly little time was spent editing this book.
I'm not sure how it got to be a New York Times Bestseller, outside of the fact that it is related to Harry Potter.
I'd advise going with a different biography
I had expected an insightful analysis of the motivations behind modern terrorism.
Instead I got a diatribe against western liberalism.
Lee Harris is the poster child for the modern John Birchers, people who believe our way is not only the best way, its the only way.
In an increasingly global economic and political system, his view of the world can be said to be outmoded, at best quaint, at worst pathological for if we are truely to address the problems facing humanity over the next 100 years, we will need tolerance and inclusivness.
I rented this book from the library about a year or so ago.
I LOVED it!
I'm back here now b/c I'm putting it on my wishlist for Christmas!
I want to read it again and again.
I'd never read Erica Jong or anything about Sappho.
I saw Erica on The Daily Show and they talked about this book and I ran to the library.
You should buy this book!
Greatness
I had eyed this book for quite some time before I purchased it, and I am so glad I did!
The pictures of the drinks are so tempting and beautifully done that you are warmed up just by flipping through the book!
Most of the recipes in this book are alcohol based, so don't pick this book up looking for lots of kid-friendly drinks (though there are definitely some that kids would enjoy, such as a s'mores hot chocolate).
The recipes are all simple and there is a nice section on creating garnishes.
Order this book and get ready to sit back and enjoy some tasty, piping hot drinks
Time was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books' recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.
The very first "Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.
The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company's kitchens and in homes across America.
This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.
This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company's bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.
The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.
If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you'll never see their likes again.
The current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.
Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.
It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.
Now way too many recipes are of the "dump and stir" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.
Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.
Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.
It's obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.
The "Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.
It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker's had in some time.
Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks' Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen.
Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called "The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook."
The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.
It's a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there's even better stuff out there now.
Go for it!
to surmise, the book is about an actor who is hired to be a political figure.
I will not reveal any more as to not ruin the nature of the plot.
I felt that like some of heinlein's books, the book is plauged with politics, less science fiction, the only sci-fi thing about it is that the plot takes place in space, other than that, it's all politics.
Same thing with Citizen of the galaxy, a book that starts off really well and ending with a theme that do not portray sci-fi rather it shows heinlein's knowledge in law.
I felt that the book could have been much better and i don't see how it won the Hugo award.
Conclusion: The book is a fun pass, but nothing more.
don't expect any groundbreaking plot, or jaw dropping plot twists, just your old fashioned politicians-dear-diary
If you are interested in learning about the *actual* science of food, but don't want to learn any science, at least read a book by someone who *did* learn it.
There is so much grossly erroneous information in this book that he discredits himself entirely.
"Oil is more dense than water-- and that's why it can be heated to higher temperatures than 212".
As a chemist and formulator I can assure you that nearly all oil is lighter than water, and even if it weren't that's *not* the reason it has a higher boiling point.
Ever make oil pppppppppp vinegar salad dressing?
Ever seen crude oil on the ocean?
How about the funk on top of old greasy dish water?
Folks, oil floats on water... and the earth is not flat.
Either this guy is a complete moron, or he is a very clever con artist.
Either way, save your money... and buy that blind Amish author's book "Semiconductor Microengineering for Dummies" instead.
It's better researched
I found the book informative while reading it, but also a bit confusing and a little dry, best used for a college course and not for recreational reading.
(Which is no doubt why we even had it in our house, someone had to use it and it's equally boring companion for some college course, I'm certain of it...
As one of America's greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan will certainly be studied by historians for years to come and, like Abraham Lincoln he will likely be revered and discussed by people of all nationalities for many generations.
This book and his earlier autobiography, Where's the Rest of Me, will surely be the touch stones for any such inquiries and discussions.
This work, An American Life, however, will be of primary importance since it addresses his entire life and political career rather than simply the earlier part of his life, during which time he was primarily a sportscaster and actor.
For anyone who had the pleasure of listening to Reagan's political commentaries on the radio, or hearing him speak as Governor of California or as President of the United States, the book will be particularly enjoyable; for it is written in the easy-going conversational style that Reagan used in life.
What makes the book even more interesting is that you can not only catch a glimpse of the country into which Ronald Reagan was born but also see how that country was transformed into the nation as we know it today.
You may also observe that the problems of Reagan's day are not much different than those we face today.
I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand Ronald Reagan, how his many faceted character was formed, the inner workings of his mind, and the actions which led to his monumental achievements.
In my view, it would benefit the country greatly if this book was made to be required reading for every American child.
This book has easy to understand pppppppppp amp; have up to date case.
The Harley Davidson case is one of the cases that showing us how's struggling US to face Japanese company offensive.
This is the good case to picturing the dawn to earth marketing strategy compare to arrogant pppppppppp amp; not efficient strategy willing by US Company
This is book was on the New York Best Seller's list because it's about New York, not because it's well written or even interesting.
You run across a few gems throughout the book, but you have to be patient to get to them.
I hate to buy, start and not finish a book... it seems like such as waste.
I'd gladly skip the book if I had to do it over again.
This should be retitled "The Leftist, Israel-Hating, Politically Correct Revisionist Guide to the Middle East."
That would be far more accurate.
For a textbook, the author freelances just a tad bit too much, a lot of what is in here is presented as fact but is mostly opinion in disguise.
The author fails in presenting a clear and unbiased view of the Middle East and instead allows his personal politics to get in the way.
My professor dumped this book as the course textbook 1/4 of the way through the semester due to the never-ending left-leaning political commentary.
This is no serious review of the Middle East, just a socialist-based fantasy on how THINGS SHOULD BE.
The author himself proclaims that accuracy isn't always important, its the idea that matters.
This book is a joke, I looked for something serious, unbiased to aid me in learning more about the Middle East but this book doesn't present anything new and its political leanings are just to the left of Stalin.
If you want to learn what an extreme left liberal thinks of the Middle East, buy this book, otherwise stick to encyclopedias and hopefully, less biased college textbooks.
The position enjoyed by Mohammed as a prophet of God is disputed by his unprovoked attacks on innocent people - Islam was spread by use of the sword.
Because Americans are poorly educated on religious history in general and Middle Eastern History in particular, this book is a must read.
It is a single source for how Islam became as powerful as it is today.
The Editor uses multiple sources to document the facts necessary to allow the reader to support the assertion that Islam is a violent religion
Never before have I been moved so completely by a simple reference book.
The author skillfully weaves his understanding of our democratic system with a profound love for L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics -- not an easy task.
I bought this for my grandmother... and she hates books.
That's how good this is.
pppppppppp quot;Better than Cats, pppppppppp quot; she says.
I can't say I necessarily agree with her -- for starters, the private sector's influence on public policy and decision-making is nowhere near as entertaining as Mister Mistofellees' song and dance -- but who am I to argue with an old woman?
Nobody, that's who
When I picked up this book I had high expectations,seeing that it had received good reviews.It opened quite spectacularly as well, on a rather surreal note.But as I read on, I couldn't help wondering what the point was in this rather incoherent, rambling tale.The book seemed like a sloppy, haphazard collection of incidents that didn't make much sense or assist character development.
The central character herself was unbelievable and I found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights.It seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip,cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky.
Some incidents were quite mirth-provoking, however,that's why I gave it two stars
The title is a misrepresentation.
This is not a handbook for driving a Porsche quickly or professionally.
I bought this book because in 2 months I am going to drive my rear engined 993 on a F1 circuit.
I have no circuit experience, and cannot get any coaching or any circuit experience in the country I live in.
Since this is a rear engined car which I have little experience with I was particularly wanting some tips particular to rear engined cars.
There is nothing in the whole book which is particular to driving Porsches or rear engined cars.
The only reason I will not throw this book out is because it has some interesting 1960's and early 19970's Porsche racing pictures (poor quality black and white though).
Also to be fair there are some good racing stories.
He is undoubtedly a very impressive driver having been successful at the highest levels in rallying and sports prototype endurance racing.
A better title would be "My Porsche Racing History".
If you want a book on fast driving I would highly recommend Ross Bentley's "Speed Secrets" in place of this book
I have sent away for a book called "Lord Given Lovers:the Holy Union of David pppppppppp Jonathan" as I find the subject very interesting in this day of same sex marriages, now that David has been used in this subject as married to Jonathan, in the days when the Scibes who wrote the law against such things, I would like to know why David and Jonathan were not stoned to death according to that same law, and if David did such a thing, I would believe that all the Jews then would have did so to, copying David and Jonathan`s example
Once again, David McCullough's treatment of an american icon is the best of its kind.
This biography reads like a fascinating novel, and McCulloughs narrative ability is unmatched.
No one seems to be able to tell a story the way he can.
The great Theodore Roosevelt, known throughout the world and across the ages as an incredibly strong, tough, larger than life figure actually began as somewhat of a weakling.
The book covers his total transformation from a sickly child to a man of great resolve and courage, the man who would become President of the United States.
Best of all is that McCullough likes and admires his subject.
This is not always the case with biographies.
Roosevelt and his family are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
Highly recommended, as are all of McCullough's books
This book is the right choice for beginers and advanced users of Spring.
It covers all major aspects supported by the framework, and goes beyond than a "24 hours learning" book.
Emphasizes the basic theory and shows how to correctly use the framework in J2EE applications
I decided to read this book because I enjoyed Dr. O'Connor's book, Undoing Depression so much.
I am delighted to report that Undoing Perpetual Stress is an even better book.
What is perpetual stress like?
The metaphor that Dr. O'Connor uses is that of an impala who thinks there's a cheetah behind every rock.
The flight or fight response is never at rest .
.
.
and the poor impala's health is soon destroyed.
Dr. O'Connor argues that our over stimulating world creates the same kinds of stress from unseen "threats" as the world goes whizzing by at 75 miles per hour.
In the book, he describes the sources of the stress, how stress undermines your body, immune system, brain and mind, and what you can do to put the stress comfortably in the background.
This book will appeal to those who are stressed out, those who experience anxiety and depression at the same time, those who love such people, and those who want to better understand the mind-body connection based on the latest scientific research.
Undoing Perpetual Stress is filled with many helpful exercises that will help even those who don't think they have too much stress.
One of the best from my perspective was taking a psychological snapshot of yourself every five years .
.
.
and spotting what was wrong with your life at each stage.
I was astonished to realize how many memories I had repressed, but which are still influencing my psychology.
And Dr. O'Connor is good about reminding you to "practice, practice, practice" the exercises and his advice.
I have been a meditator for over ten years, and this book helped me to gain a lot of perspective on what the meditation is helping and what it is not.
While I have eliminated a lot of the background noise, I haven't dealt with a lot of old issues.
It was helpful to find out what those issues are .
.
.
and what to do about them.
I found that my creativity and mind were suddenly freed by the process.
For parents, there's a lot of new information here on how various parenting methods influence a child over a lifetime.
It's a lot better than what you read in that first book about how to be a parent.
Check it out!
This book should be required reading for anyone who finishes high school
I have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title.
As others have pointed out, Coughlin's ego can be suffocating at times.
This could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw.
Alas it is not.
The writing is amateurish at best and the author's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting.
The language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus.
Again this could be forgiven as we're reading this book for a soldier's account, not that of an English grad student.
This book offers a stark contrast in comparison with Nathaniel Fick's "One Bullet Away."
Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent, thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men, Coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else.
He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company.
You cannot know a person from reading their writing but Coughlin's character development is very superficial.
His attempts to convey a "human side" are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived.
This is a great contrast to the character development in "One Bullet."
There is no connection between author and reader in "Shooter."
Coughlin does not develop the role players either.
In "One Bullet" you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer, his NCOs and the enlisted men.
Additionally, Coughlin's demeaning descriptions of his support staff (non-trigger pullers) is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic.
To make matters worse the action isn't as well developed as in other titles.
The author's self-congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits, with plenty of after-action chest thumping, obscures the view of battle.
He spends little time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft, training and shooting.
This can be found elsewhere.
Overall this book was a great disappointment.
If only a fraction of Coughlin's self-acclaimed exploits are true, then he is a remarkable sniper.
He should let his accomplishments speak for themselves and not try to beat us over the head with them
I read the second edition of this book since it is enlarged with the study of the housing market.
The phenomenon of bubbles and negative bubbles or collapses is described extremely well by means of statistical data of markets for over a century and a half.
The raw data is adjusted to inflation to give a realistic perspective of the trends and patterns.
Bubbles seem to be occurring at regular intervals typically based on the "new era" story and everyone believes at least during the heady days that good times are here to stay.
But as shown by proven evidence of the past, no bubble has sustained itself permanently and good reason prevails sooner or later.
When this happens, the bloated bubble collapses and the hangover is terrible.
The story so far is quite simple.
But what makes this book so interesting is the depth of research and the manner in which the phenomenon is studied and explained.
The combination of mass psychology and market prices is at the core of this book.
For bubbles to happen, information flow is the key.
Media plays a significant role in disseminating information and bubbles seem to have originated in recorded history after the advent of the print media.
In recent times electronic media particularly the television and the internet play a significant role in speeding up bubble formation and also the reversals.
Media needs a storyline and this story needs to be continued to retain customers on a daily basis.
Stock market is the ideal place that offers an opportunity to try one's luck if a casino is far away.
Backed by on-line dedicated news channels and internet trading, well, it is not surprising that we have day traders in herds.
In such situations fundamentals like industry analysis and P/E ratios take a backseat as explained by the author.
Historical averages are breached and a euphoria of "once in a life time opportunity" prevails.
What happens to the Efficient Markets Theory in such situations?.
Since this theory says that markets are perfectly priced based on all publicly available information there cannot be a situation of either under pricing or over pricing.
This book perfectly challenges the efficiency and accuracy of this theory.
It is unfortunate that substantial amounts of investments meant to be otherwise risk free sources of income, pension funds for example, are getting diverted into risky markets.
Here the author has come out with a list of some sound proposals to protect hard earned life long savings of innocent citizens who are exposed to the irrationality of markets.
The bubble in the housing market is also discussed well.
Housing seems to be isolated bubbles occurring in specific regions and not a global phenomenon.
But nevertheless the damage can be the same.
The party of low interest rate regime seems to be over and a spike in mortgage rates is sure to be the needle that will prick right through this big speculative bubble.
What goes up has to come down !
But once you start reading this book, it is difficult to put it down.
Intellectually stimulating and bound to be economically rewarding.
The most gorgeous artwork in comic books.
Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!)
A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again.
A must-have for comic book fans.
I have to agree with Stephen Haines.
This guy drags in everything but the kitchen sink.
He makes Boehme a Gnostic, the troubadors, the Knights Templar, William Blake, the Masons, Jung, and finally, any physicist worth his salt.
I mean, some of these folks might not have been orthodox in their Christian practice, but being heterodox does not make one a Gnostic.
How did he forget Meister Eckhart, and Sabbatai Tzvi?
If he has Boehme as a Gnostic, then these also are Gnostic.
He never distinguishes between Gnosticism as a group of sects, and gnostic practice, which pervades Kabbalah, Sufism,etc.
This is just not a good book
As an econ student at UC Davis, I have learned to appreciate books that explain concepts concisely and in an easily understandable way.
This is one of those few.
Chapters are relatively short and are uncluttered with unnecessary examples or tangents.
Graphs are labeled with simple explanations that are useful for clarification as well as quick-reference.
I recommend this book to people who want to understand econ without trudging through the swamp of repetition, needless technicality, and headache
Philbrick does an outstanding job of weaving an enthralling story from historical references.
He gives the reader a wonderful sense of the social, religious and political forces that motivated the Pilgrims in their incredibly risky venture into the unknown.
The book presents a fascinating view of the clash of the Native American and English cultures that tragically led to the near annihilation of the New England "Indians".
Horowitz with the help of researchers provides glimpses of the "101 most dangerous academics in America."
Your own political outlook will determine whether you think Horowitz is an American hero or a buffoon.
I'll vote for American hero as Horowitz provides details on professors whose very existence on a campus should motivate people concerned for their children and the destiny of the United States to march on the legislatures that use taxpayer funds to pay most of these "academics" demanding their immediate termination.
College has changed.
Where the goal was once to teach young minds to think independently, it is now a place for intdoctrination, with punishment meted out for non-conformance to the various left-wing doctrines being rammed down the throats of young adults.
The book is so densely packed that choosing representative excerpts could easily create a shorter bookof its own.
For example, Professor Jose Angel Gutierrez opines "[w]e have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean by that is if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill him."
This from a licensed attorney, now a professor paid from the public purse - taxpayer dollars.
Prof. Alison Jaggar, another beneficiary of taxpayer money, seeks to combat the "male-dominant structure of everyday life."
She seeks, essentially, a world without men.
Not exactly an inclusive outlook.
The examples cited above are mild.
Most are far worse - and these are the people, often supported by taxpayers in public colleges, who are forcing their views into the minds of young people.
With tenure and increasing control of the hiring process, other views are shut out of the academy.
The academy itself is being converted into a political training ground.
Many of these left-wing radicals are tenured and can not be fired, not even the likes of Prof. Haunani-Kay Trask who says "[t]he enemy is the United States of America and everyone who supports it."
She also advocates the deportation of all non-ethnic Hawaiians from the islands.
And the taxpayers foot the bill for her to "teach".
Some of the names are familiar to many as talking heads, such as Prof. Joseph Massad who demands the destruction of Israel and denies that the Jews are a nation.
Imagine what happens to a student, a Jewish student in particular, who disputes Massad's views.
This happened and Massad screamed at the students.
When the matter was investigated - a rarity - Massad conveniently couldn't remember the incidents.
Other of these professors make equally outlandish claims, many of them based on race, gender or sexual preference.
Reading this book is a sure invitation to outrage - and then depression as you realize that there is little the average citizen can do to stop what is happening, unless citizens band together to create enough of an uproar as does happen on all too rare occasion.
A must-read for anyone concerned with the fate of America's young minds and the nation itself.
Jerr
I can't remember the last time I failed to finish reading a novel.
I abandoned this one with 100 pages to go.
With another implausible plot twist, I've had enough.
Maybe I've been spoiled by the quality of character driven fiction from George Pelecanos, James Lee Burke, Robert B parker, James Sallis, Scott Phillips, and Robert Crais but I suspect that this is not just a failure to connect with the characters and more to do with poor writing.
I've read quite a number of Deaver's novels and enjoyed the complex plots and the exploration of psychologically/psyciatrically devient chbaracters, but this is just over the top.
When I came to the chapter that excplained how the magician faked his death while in custody, that was enough.
I have another fifty novels lined up waiting to be read and I'll be damned if I'm going to waste any more time on this poor one.
For that matter, after six or so Lincoln Rhyme novels, I can't say that I really know or care anything about Lincoln or Saches
My husband has a theory that Danielle Steel has a dart board and each circle surrounding the center is labeled either, falls in love, loses family member, has death of loved-one,fights for life of herself or loved one, loses partner,business or spouse.
He feels when she is at a loss she justs throws off a dart and whatever she hits becomes the outline for her next book.
I have been a loyal fan for many many years and take his kidding with a smile and secretly pray he's not right.
This book proved me wrong and he was right all these years.
It was so obvious from the first few pages what was happening that I was certain I had read this story before somewhere.
After having waited long time to get this book from my local library I was so disappointed that it was so poorly written and so badly not thought through I couldn't even read it completely, but skipped sections to finish it, knowing what was going to happen before I got to it.
I suppose every author in this genre comes to the table with an agenda.
That being said, in this book, Mr. DiLorenzo seems to play fast and loose with the facts (or at least with his conclusions).
The flyleaf of this book promises "extensive research and meticulous documentation" but at least one other reviewer has already pointed out some problems with this author's historical research.
That should raise a red flag to anyone reading this book.
Consider this: The author claims Lincoln was more interested in building an American "empire" by centralizing Federal power than ending slavery.
This implies Lincoln was premeditated in what he would do as President.
I challenge anyone who believes that to read Lincoln's actual words and, more importantly, examine his actions.
This we know: Abraham Lincoln was a complicated man and, as a thoughtful person, his views on slavery changed during his many years in public life.
He came to believe that slavery would not die out on its own.
I do recommend purchasing and reading this book since it is so different from the mythical view we have of Lincoln today.
However, when it comes to some of the "facts" and conclusions expounded in this book be very careful what you believe
Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected.
I didn't really connect with the main characters.
I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story.
I liked this book, but I notice that all the critics seem to hate it.
It did take me more than a year of picking at it on and off.
I picked it up because Walter Laqueur referred to it in one of his books about terrorism.
Written in 1886, it suggests that there is a pan-European anarchist underground, which the protagonist gets mixed up with.
It is interesting in its depiction of liberal guilt among the wealthy, who support a political movement that would lead to their own extinction.
The prose is wonderful, as is the depiction of the subtleties of the characters' personalities, if you have the taste for that sort of thing.
All in all, it was worth reading and it passed the most important test for a novel: I finished it with regret.
I had previously read and liked Portrait of a Lady, which is a superior novel.
As much as I liked it, I would have to say do not start with Princess as an introduction to James.
Incidentally, I have a theory about the omniscient narrator in James' books being a malign demiurge, but I will spare you that theorizing here
was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.
Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free
This is the best Rich Dad book to date.
The book is filled with priceless information that 90% of people in the U.S.(particularly baby-boomers) are clueless about today.
Most Rich Dad fans will know that Kiyosaki's books tend to talk about the same general principles and don't touch on many new and groundbreaking concepts.
This book, however, is the exception.
I learned so many eye-opening things from this masterpiece.
It has truly changed my life and the way I look at money.
Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS BOOK.
For most of us, the area of thanatology is something quite new, despite the fact that death is such an intimate "companion" that can come at any moment of our lives, whether by degrees or instantaneously, irrelevant of our ethnic, social and economic backgrounds.
It is a plain truth that can not be avoided, and no technological advancements can make it go away.
I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you, despite what your feelings may be.
And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier, the adult must equally do so with death, not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means: the total cessation of physical life, for if one denys its existence and its inevitability, the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache, but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental, spiritual and religious grief as well.
Submission to and acceptance of the truth, no matter how difficult it would be to hear, could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing.
In Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's classic study of the dying process, she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them.
But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person, the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all.
Hence, how do you take the sting from the wound?
In On Death and Dying, you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say, to let them vent, and at their own pace, go through the classic defined stages of the dying process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.
The patients become our teachers.
We learn of their fears, their possible financial burdens, in one woman's case, the fear of the worms, et cetera.
But we also learn about what the families go through, their own anger and disbelief and guilt.
It is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved.
Sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger, other times not.
The United States is one of the most death-denying countries out there, a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process, for going foward means only one thing: death.
Ross's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is, the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe.
Death has issues for everybody, doctors, faith-filled people, even Ross heself.
It is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later.
But it is comforting to know that we are all in it together.
Serious genealogists hobbyists and professionals will be excited by this new resource, which thoroughly explains the new science of DNA testing and how it can be applied to family history research.
Although this book is not for everyone, if you have successfully passed high school biology, you should be able to manage the information and its technology in this excellent reference.
Wouldn't it be interesting for a man and his wife to go back in time to discover about when they might have had an ancestor in common?
DNA testing and analysis had give you that and much more.
It can even give you an idea what part of the world your pre-historical ancestors lived and migrated to.
The authors practice what they preach and tell how we can do it too, with many DNA labs and companies listed and compared.
We rated this book four hearts
Okay, the title is a bit much.
But I enjoyed this book tremendously.
Some of the criticisms point to the elements I liked best.
The routine cases, how they were approached, and the results were a revelation to someone who has no real idea of police work except what I've seen on "Cops" (constant action and crisis!).
There was a new story on every page, and I wound up reading until 1 a.m. on a work day because I just couldn't help reading "one more page".
The descriptions of the surroundings, the characters, the sounds and smells of the settings, conjured up a real sense of being there.
I was fascinated by the character faults and virtues of the people in the book, as Atkinson tried to remain true to McCain's philosophy that most people aren't entirely good or bad.
As a resident of the area, I finally understand the gang wars that were taking place when I was growing up (I remember the old Boston Record American newpaper with the crime scene photos splashed across the front).
I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who lives in the Northeast, and to others who'd like a glimpse into how Boston politics are practiced in every profession
Mark Rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in America.
Most of his ideas are solid, but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word "interesting" to describe it.
Did they actually read it?
This book is an unending parade of boring and repeated ideas presented in different, yet equally boring ways.
I honestly beleive that this book has destroyed the thrill of musical chairs for me forever.
This book could have been written in about 150 pages instead of the 250 it actually took if he simply used his original, not to mention solid, ideas.
The nature of the book greatly weakened his overall argument.
Not only was the book dry, but it also seemed to fail to acknowledge the global system the US is a part of, and in particular, the role that immigration plays on poverty in the US.
He talks about the US and the people in it as if they were static, but we live in a very fluid world, growing more fluid everyday, and I feel that his failure to ackowledge this fact truly hurts his overall argument.
Well, the name of this set does say it all.
Fashion!
That's the theme of this mix pppppppppp match stationery set.
I liked it a bit more than some of the other mix pppppppppp match stationery sets out there.
The paper quality is a teensy bit better with this set as the paper is slightly thicker.
The illustrations are very colorful and pretty, it has drawings and he complements each with colors such as bright blue and fuchsia.
The drawings are all bold and enjoyable ranging from a pattern of high-heeled shoes or little kisses to a close-up of a very Warhol-esque face.
At the top of each sheet, there are little quotes of Andy's relating to fashion.
Very cool for maintaining the overall theme, I think.
The different colored-envelopes each have a flap that more or less complements one of the particular sheet designs but of course, as the name suggests, it's all open to a little mix pppppppppp match.
Finally, there are quite a lot of stickers to decorate your mail as your will dictates.
They're very pretty too including purses, mannequins, kisses, and oh, they're the clear kind so they look a little bit more distinguished.
All in all, a very good way to spruce up your everyday mail.
Get it especially if you're a fan of Andy Warhol or a die-hard fashionista
