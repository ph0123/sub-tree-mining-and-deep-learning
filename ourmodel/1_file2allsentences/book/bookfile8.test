Kerrie Fitzgerald "lonewolfe"		The runaway bunny: Books: Margaret Wise Brown		1		I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. <sssss> I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality. <sssss> In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. <sssss> I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. <sssss> I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' <sssss> better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love. <sssss> 'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. <sssss> I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. <sssss> They love it and so do we as parents. <sssss> But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family. <sssss> Take it w/a grain of salt
Alejandro Castro		Reading Magic: Why Reading Aloud to Our Children Will Change Their Lives Forever: Books: Mem Fox,Judy Horacek		2		In general the book provides some simple tips of how to help your children to learn reading by having fun and develop a taste for reading. <sssss> It worked for me, and I would recommend it for parents that are eager to provide their children with a push for developing this important skill
Nancy Kelly		How the U.S. Government Works: Books: Syl Sobel		2		Syl Sobel is my nextdoor neighbor. <sssss> This book is a wonderful resource for the whole family. <sssss> It is illustrated, has a glossary for those hard to know terms and an index! <sssss> Buy this book today!
Disturbed Reader		Listening to Prozac: The Landmark Book About Antidepressants and the Remaking of the Self, Revised Edition: Books: Peter D. Kramer		1		This is a very famous and a very influential book. <sssss> This was not the first time I checked the book out of the library but I now know much more about antidepressants and the related issues than I did when I first became familiar with Kramer's book. <sssss> What I found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me. <sssss> This is not a book supported by research. <sssss> It is a book of stories. <sssss> The stories, one after the other, are about Kramer's patients (Kramer is a psychiatrist) and how taking Prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight. <sssss> Consider these four examples. <sssss> 1. <sssss> Sam: "Sam not only recovered from his depression, he declared himself better than well. <sssss> He felt unencumbered, more vitally alive, less pessimistic. <sssss> Now he could complete projects in one draft, whereas before he sketched and sketched again. <sssss> His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. <sssss> His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. <sssss> Every aspect of his work went more smoothly. <sssss> He appeared more poised, more thoughtful, less distracted. <sssss> He was able to speak at professional gatherings without notes. <sssss> (Page x.) <sssss> 2. <sssss> Sally: After four months on Prozac, she looked brighter, calmer, self-assured, in control of herself. <sssss> The most important effect of the medication, Sally felt was that it cleared her head...After ten months...she negotiated a small promotion and pay raise at a time when the bank was cutting back staff...More remarkable was the change to her private life. <sssss> She started going to dances...(Page 147.) <sssss> 3. <sssss> William M: The patient's low self-esteem, which had been present since his earliest childhood, began to disappear...On medication William M. experienced a sense of self-worth superior to any he had felt before. <sssss> (Page 203.) <sssss> 4. <sssss> Ms. B: For the first time in her memory she felt perfectly relaxed and happy sitting at home reading books or listening to music and felt less of the free-floating anxiety that was previously quelled by going out...Off Prozac, Ms. B. bar-hopped in search of men. <sssss> Prozac moderated her sense of aloneness and allowed her to enjoy a variety of social settings. <sssss> Dozens of other examples could be cited. <sssss> The point is, this is essentially the book. <sssss> It is a book which convinces the reader of the almost magic power of Prozac by sharing stories like these. <sssss> What is disturbing is that I now know the truth. <sssss> Research investigations have found that the power of antidepressants has increased dramatically. <sssss> They are now more effective because our belief in the power of a pill to cure social shyness, anxiety, depression, and a bad temper has increased dramatically. <sssss> We have come to believe, as Kramer puts it, "biology is destiny" (page xiv). <sssss> No where does Kramer explain that the longest of the clinical trial used to get approval of Prozac to market was only 8 weeks long. <sssss> No where does he share that a tranquilizer was given to study subjects and the other tricks used to make the effectiveness of the drug appear greater than it really is. <sssss> The dangers of long-term use (diabetes, Parkinson's disease, permanent muscle jerking, etc.) <sssss> are never discussed. <sssss> (Of course, these problems were still unknown when Kramer wrote.) <sssss> See Timothy Scott's wonderful, and unlike Kramer's book, carefully documented book America Fooled: The Truth About Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, and How We've Been Fooled to find the dangers as well as what does bring good mental health. <sssss> Yes, this book has been influential. <sssss> Thus, Kramer bears some of the responsibilty for the myth surrounding antidepressants. <sssss> (They do not work as well as exercise even--numerous studies.) <sssss> It's funny how, as our knowledge grows, a great book beomes a harmful book, but it is just that.
Mandy D. "Romantic Suspense Reader"		Dead Wrong: A Novel: Books: Mariah Stewart		2		The twist here is that the reader knows while the characters do not. <sssss> In a matter of minutes, nine people's fates are determined by three men sitting in a jail cell. <sssss> Simply playing a "game" to pass the time, each man names three people he'd like to see killed. <sssss> When the first man is released, three people become a target as he follows through with the game. <sssss> The first in a trilogy, Dead Wrong gets it dead right. <sssss> Mara Douglas is on one of the men's list, and it's up to Aidan Shields to protect her. <sssss> While the book is decidedly light on the traditional sex part of a romantic suspense, it is implied. <sssss> I liked both characters, and Aidan avoids being the atypical surly alpha male with surprising charm and affection. <sssss> I can't wait for Dead Certain, which follows the second man as he is released from jail and takes up the gauntlet thrown down by the first man. <sssss> I got this one from the library, but I certainly will buy the next two
Chris Luallen		An Underground Education: Books: Richard Zacks		2		"Underground Education" does not so much offer a radical intellectual perspective, as is perhaps implied by the title. <sssss> But rather is a collection of funny stories and oddball facts about various people and events from the past. <sssss> Some of the historical figures are famous, such as George Washington and Cleopatra. <sssss> While others, like the several female serial killers discussed, are more obscure. <sssss> The book is divided into 10 chapters, including the arts, religion, science and sex. <sssss> Actually, this book reminds me somewhat of the "People's Almanac" series written by David Wallechinsky. <sssss> But here the emphasis is definitely on the strange and often perverse. <sssss> It's a fun read for those interested in this sort of knowledge. <sssss> But some entries are overlong and most readers will probably want to read the sections of greatest interest rather than cover to cover. <sssss> Still it is a worthwhile purchase.
		Dr. Deming: The American Who Taught the Japanese About Quality: Books: Rafael Aguayo		2		I read this book five years ago, when I was a manager leading a small company about 15 people. <sssss> I honour management style that respect human nature. <sssss> Deming's priciples presented in this book give me a systematic insight of the principles based on mutual trusting and respect. <sssss> I used his approach -- our company makes good profit -- and more important, all the staff enjoy working in our company
Nina Shishkoff "mycologist"		Deadly Slipper: A Novel of Death in the Dordogne: Books: Michelle Wan		1		If I had been an editor and received "Deadly Slipper", I would have said the following: "Dear Ms. Wan, Your book is unacceptable for the following reasons: 1) The Setting. <sssss> One hazard of writing about the place where you spend your summers is that you end up writing through the eyes of a visitor rather than a native. <sssss> Dordogne sounds delightful,and I'd certainly like to visit it based on your descriptions of delightful pigeon coops and sheep scattered across the landscape, but it is disturbing that you have cicadas singing in May. <sssss> It suggests you are only familiar with the setting during the vacation months when you habitually visit. <sssss> To really describe a place, I think you need to know it better. <sssss> 2) The characters. <sssss> Because you spend your summers in Dordogne, you appear to know only other wealthy foreigners. <sssss> All your main characters are expatriates with irritatingly bourgeois occupations. <sssss> I don't know if you realize that all the native-born French characters you portray are ugly, boorish, sexually depraved, mentally defective, criminal, or terminally quaint, and they all appear to make cheese. <sssss> Surely this isn't a realistic portrayal of the French. <sssss> 3) The Orchids. <sssss> Actually, the orchids are fine, but the idea that orchid fanciers are maniacal and possibly homicidal is a questionable one; most orchid fanciers are fairly tedious. <sssss> Also, the idea that a lady slipper mutant would spontaneously occur and allow the orchid to live outside its native habitat is idiotic. <sssss> Anyone would tell you that a hybrid is a better bet. <sssss> 4) The Dogs. <sssss> One cute dog is sufficient; two are too much. <sssss> Puppies are inexcusable. <sssss> 5) The Romance. <sssss> Most mystery writer are aware of the hazard of including a romance in a mystery, but you walked in innocently, unaware that your two characters are unpleasant, self-involved and have no chemistry (and that's not even mentioning their unspeakable dogs). <sssss> You set a big obstacle in their path by having one think the other is a deranged serial killer; a great writer might be able to pull this off, but you can't. <sssss> 6) Trendoid aspects. <sssss> Epistolary novels are *so* 18th century. <sssss> But having a NY psychiatrist profile the serial killer by email is so LAST WEEK. <sssss> You will be sorry you did this, sooner rather than later. <sssss> 7) The Ending. <sssss> Ridiculous and melodramatic. <sssss> Georges Simenon wrote about crime with great psychological acuity. <sssss> You should read one of his books.
brwneydgrl78		Durable Goods: Books: Elizabeth Berg,Jen Taylor		1		i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. <sssss> nothing ever happens. <sssss> there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story
Amalfi Coast Girl		The Art of Eating Well: An Italian Cookbook: Books: Pellegrino Artusi		2		This review is written from the perspective of a serious home cook that has been studying cooking for 25 years and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years. <sssss> This book is targeted to anyone that wants to learn the history of Italian cooking. <sssss> This book is full of both information and recipes. <sssss> This was one of my first Italian cookbooks, and is still one of my favorites. <sssss> This book is an authentic Italian cookbook not the Italian-American type that we are accustomed to in the USA. <sssss> If you want a good comprehensive book on authentic Italian food this is one of the books that I would recommend. <sssss> However, if you are a beginner Italian cook, this is not the book for you. <sssss> The directions are written for someone that is familiar with the Italian kitchen. <sssss> The author assumes you have a basic knowledge of the Italian kitchen and typical recipes. <sssss> One complaint, and it is minor, is the lack of glossy photographs that I have become so accustomed to in cookbooks. <sssss> The recipes in this book more than make up for the lack of photographs. <sssss> Overall this book is highly recommended for those that are serious about Italian cooking
G. Fisher "corsair"		Northern Lights: Books: Nora Roberts		2		I'm generally into non-fiction and new to Nora Roberts, but I enjoyed "Northen Lights" very much. <sssss> The book is well crafted with a believable plot and a group of quirky likeable charcters. <sssss> I was sorry to finish the book and found myself wanting to vist "Lunacy Alaska" again. <sssss> Final test was I ordered and sent the book to a dear very literate friend; she enjoyed it as much as I did
J. Walsh		Birnbaum's Walt Disney World 2006 (Birnbaum's Walt Disney World): Books: Birnbaum		1		If you are going to Walt Disney World Resort for the first time and want to keep some mystery until you actually ride the attractions, then this book may not be for you. <sssss> Some of the descriptions for the various attractions go step-by-step through them, including plot points in 3D movies and so on. <sssss> The book also leaves a lot out in other areas, such as dining (little coverage), getting around Walt Disney World, and off-site hotels and dining. <sssss> For me, the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World (by Bob Sehlinger) was much better at giving me the info I needed without giving away any details as to the surprises on the rides. <sssss> That is, it told me what might frighten a youngster, what might bore an adult, and so on, but it didn't say specifically what would happen at every stage of any of the attractions. <sssss> Just generalizations about the ride, then specific warnings for different types of people. <sssss> The only things Birnbaum offers that the Unofficial Guide doesn't are pictures and info on some of the ancillary activities such as parasailing. <sssss> If you have an Internet connection, you don't need the pictures. <sssss> And as for the ancillary activities as well as nice maps, you can't beat the Passporter book on Disney World. <sssss> So, for me, the Unofficial Guide plus the Passporter yields the best trip planning library for Walt Disney World. <sssss> If you like, you can also pick up the EZ-Guide, as it also has some interesting maps and info. <sssss> As for Birnbaum's, it really doesn't have anything to offer. <sssss> I wouldn't recommend against buying it, though, except for the "let me tell you the plot and ending to the movie before you go" mentality. <sssss> I hate spoilers, and wish someone had warned me before I started reading this book
R. Balfour		Godless: The Church of Liberalism (Random House Large Print): Books: Ann Coulter		1		Ann Coulter is unbelievable in her unrelenting hatred of anyone not in aggreement with her warped sense of reality. <sssss> To her there is no middle ground. <sssss> I am an educated, well travelled adult who while born in the United States, spent a good portion of my childhood living overseas and consider myself to be fairly open minded. <sssss> To be called a communist, a traitor, and an enemy of America just because I don't buy into the ultra conservative mind think is an insult to the freedom that this country was founded on. <sssss> I have never in my life considered buring or destroying a book because of it's evil, until I read this one. <sssss> Be afraid, be very afraid of these people
Handmade Christmas Cards		You: On a Diet: The Owners Manual for Waist Management (Book and DVD): Books: Michael Roizen,Mehmet Oz		2		I think this is really an excellent book, one that I would highly recommend. <sssss> Everyone should read this and realize the words of wisdom. <sssss> The authors do an EXCELLENT job of talking about why it is so important to eat well about all the benefits of proper diet and the dangers of improper diets. <sssss> And so on, and so forth. <sssss> Get the book and educate yourself
Missus Dakey		Strong Women and Men Beat Arthritis: Books: Miriam E. Nelson		2		I was recently diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis, and I started following the nutritional suggestions in this book. <sssss> I think it's already starting to help! <sssss> Plus it tells you how to perform strengthening exercises for your aching joints. <sssss> I am a big fan of Dr. Nelson's other works. <sssss> I like how she explains the science and the applications. <sssss> I plan to share this with my mom, who also has osteoarthritis
Luc REYNAERT		Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies: Books: Jared Diamond		2		Jared Diamond has an ambitious goal: explain the history of mankind globally. <sssss> His thesis is quite simple: different people had different histories because of geographical (environmental), not innate (racial) differences. <sssss> He presents, develops and defends his point of view brilliantly and forcefully. <sssss> Some people remained hunters-gatherers, while others became masters of the world. <sssss> The crucial factor in human history is food. <sssss> The availability of materials (plants, animals) for domestication leads to the production of food surpluses in some geographical fertile regions, which allowed the feeding of specialists outside agriculture (craftsmen, warriors, bureaucrats, priests, kings). <sssss> Intensive food production, population size and societal complexity stimulated each other as fewer peasants were needed to feed the whole population. <sssss> Craftsmen developed maritime, military and industrial technology and warriors conquered new territories. <sssss> Population growth generated a centralized organization (a state structure) for decision making (politics) and conflict resolutions (law). <sssss> Domestication provided other cardinal advantages. <sssss> Infectious diseases evolve from animal diseases. <sssss> Through intimacy with animals people became immune. <sssss> But, when not immunized populations came in contact with immunized, they were wiped out. <sssss> Also, animals could be used as power engines and warrior transport means. <sssss> Other important historical factors were those related to transmission of acquired knowledge: migration and, cardinally, writing. <sssss> While hunter-gatherer groups remained more or less egalitarian, states with centralized governments generated great differences of wealth. <sssss> They became ruled by elite which controlled nearly wholly (kleptocracy) or partially the manna of the state (the budget). <sssss> But, how could the elite continue to control the masses? <sssss> Jared Diamond sees 4 different solutions: arm the elite and disarm the masses, redistribution of wealth, impose public order and curb violence (police), construct ideology or religion to justify the kleptocracy. <sssss> The author remarks judiciously that with the organization of the state the irrational beliefs of the population became institutionalized into an `official' religion. <sssss> All in all, Jared Diamond's book is a magisterial and very revealing Darwinian essay about power problems and survival of the human species. <sssss> A must read for all those interested in the history of mankind.
Bobby Underwood "starlighthotel"		A Thief of Time (Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee Novels): Books: Tony Hillerman		2		Tony Hillerman once again takes us into the world of the Navajo with Jim Chee and the legendary Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Tribal Police. <sssss> I read this for the first time some years ago, and this entry in the long-running series is very exciting. <sssss> It has a lot of atmosphere and Leaphorn and Chee are fleshed out more than usual in this terrific read. <sssss> Both Chee and Leaphorn are dealing with personal issues as this one begins. <sssss> Chee hasn't quite figured out how he feels about Mary leaving him because he could not leave his Navajo way of life behind and move to the city with her. <sssss> He is smitten with a pretty Navajo attorney named Janet but she's with someone else. <sssss> Leaphorn meanwhile, is on terminal leave and retiring after the unexpected death of his beloved wife Emma. <sssss> Niether he or Chee can explain his obsession with finding a missing pot hunter named Eleanor Friedman-Bernal. <sssss> No Navajo would be involved, as stealing pots like this would make one a "Thief of Time" according to Navajo tradition. <sssss> Chee's letting a rather large backhoe get stolen right from under his nose will have ties to Leaphorn's investigation, and once more Chee will be helping Leaphorn all across the Navajo territory. <sssss> This one will stretch all the way into Utah and down the San Juan River. <sssss> Leaphorn will be reminded of a young boy's death by drowning before this one wraps up, and it will have unexpected ties to his search for Eleanor. <sssss> It seems Eleanor was looking for pots made by the Anasazi, a tribe that simply vanished from the face of the earth. <sssss> Pictographs and petroglyphs of Kokopelli, the "Watersprinkler," will play a vital part in this mystery. <sssss> But Eleanor's interest is also anthropological, and someone thinks what she's discovered is worth killing for. <sssss> Leaphorn and Chee will be hundreds of miles apart when they reach the same conclusion in this complex mystery. <sssss> One will have to race to the other as things turn ugly, and two very different men will find commom ground when Leaphorn asks the unexpected of young Chee. <sssss> Hillerman's descriptions of the thousand foot cliffs along the San Juan River at night, under a sky filled with Navajo mystery, will enthrall you. <sssss> This is a good mystery and quite possibly the best in the series. <sssss> You don't want to miss this one
Dave "df"		The Map That Changed the World: William Smith and the Birth of Modern Geology: Books: Simon Winchester		1		Mr. Winchester takes an interesting subject, collects enough material to make a fine article in, say, National Geographic, and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length. <sssss> (Case in point, a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid, but loses it, and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss. <sssss> Ick. <sssss> Self-induldgent. <sssss> Boring.) <sssss> Worse, still, even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material, such as relates, say, to the subject's wife, all Mr. Winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations. <sssss> I guess extensive research might have been too time consuming. <sssss> Numerous times I considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful, but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going, hence my review of two stars. <sssss> John McPhee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than Mr. Winchester, and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story
darkguardian2 "darkguardian2"		Leadership for Dummies: Books: Marshall Loeb,Stephen Kindel		2		It's an easy read and can be applied immediately to you situation. <sssss> The book brings the basics of leadership traits and principles to the reader similar to the military leadership books I've read in the USMC. <sssss> So many times have I held jobs where a manager, although excellent in managing projects, through some lack of sensitity or judgement created an uproar that cause moral to fall and people to become resentful and leave. <sssss> There are many stories in the press of managers and CEOs restricting "bathroom breaks", playing favorites, freezing wages and laying off employees while taking huge "bonuses" like American Airlines and ENRON. <sssss> What's present here is basic but essential information for anyone in a leadership roll whether at work, church functions, or managing a family trip. <sssss> This should be required reading for everyone BEFORE you find yourself in a situation as leader. <sssss> The boss could be out for a whole month tommorrow. <sssss> Can you keep the team working smoothly while the boss is out or is it party time
James H. McDuffie		Ahead of the Market: The Zacks Method for Spotting Stocks Early -- In Any Economy: Books: Mitch Zacks,Mitchel Zacks		1		There are two things which tickle me about this book. <sssss> One is the sample Zack's report at the back which has a strong buy #1 rating on a -.3% return on equity stock. <sssss> The other is the section on practical use of the system. <sssss> It, of course, is for any type of investor including long term investors even though the effects that the system measures lasts only for 1 - 3 months. <sssss> And don't forget about growth investors and value investors either. <sssss> This section is so short as to be laughable. <sssss> Also notice that in the 2002 A list there were 216 stocks. <sssss> Most are going to have to buy a subset. <sssss> But what subset? <sssss> No info is provided on the performance of typical subsets for each investor class. <sssss> Perhaps an MVO addict or a Monte Carlo hack would have the answer
Judith C. Kinney		Couples: Books: John Updike		1		This book is the reason I've read only one John Updike novel. <sssss> I was so disgusted by the people, the plot, and the very boring and unrelated technical passages that I never read another Updike. <sssss> I thought the characters were completely unrealistic
HaHaHa I'm NOT NAUSIOUS!!!		What to Expect When You're Expecting, Third Edition: Books: Heidi Murkoff,Arlene Eisenberg,Sandee Hathaway		1		I am newly preg too. <sssss> I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. <sssss> I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. <sssss> I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! <sssss> IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. <sssss> Ha ha ha... Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. <sssss> I would just not be near them while they smoke. <sssss> Period. <sssss> She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. <sssss> Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. <sssss> And if that doesn't work try being nice. <sssss> I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. <sssss> Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! <sssss> (Implied: OR Ever!) <sssss> I take pride in keeping myself fit. <sssss> I am a little freaked about the weight issue. <sssss> I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. <sssss> What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me. <sssss> Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife.
D. Stevens "Texas Pimpernel"		When Rabbit Howls: Books: Truddi Chase,Robert A. Phillips		1		I must admit I was skeptical when I first opened this book based on previous knowledge I had of MPD. <sssss> This book made me that much more skeptical. <sssss> In most cases of MPD or DID as it is now more commonly referred to the problem arises through the suggestive power of the therapist. <sssss> This case is different though. <sssss> On page 67 of the paperback copy I got, Ms Chase describes Stanley(her name for Phillips) as wondering how it is that the personalities could seemingly communicate with each other while at the same time not being aware of each other. <sssss> Her answer that she or as she claims her "troops" give is that it is through the use of "thought transference" which was known to the ancient Greeks as she tells us later on. <sssss> I almost burst out laughing when I read that. <sssss> She also contradicts her claim that the alters don't know of each other later when she has one of them discussing the alters Rabbit and Sister Mary Catherine at the same time. <sssss> Another way this happens is how they often refer to themselves as 'we'. <sssss> Many of the alters sound as though they came from books or movies. <sssss> The abuse that she claims occurred while living with her stepfather is rather graphic. <sssss> Her claims really belong in the same realm as those who claim past life memories, ufo sightings, satanic ritual abuse, and second sight. <sssss> I think she is not credible in the least. <sssss> There is not one fact given to support her claims of past abuse and it would be interesting for someone to write a book looking into her claims to see if there is anything that would substantiate them. <sssss> She does let us know in the book that she is very creative, artistic, intelligent, and apparently well read. <sssss> I think this has a lot to do with her claims of multiple personalities. <sssss> The book itself is long, boring, anti-climatic even with the final confrontation with the stepfather which occurs at the end. <sssss> She also seems to be claiming in the book some pscyhic abilities. <sssss> Don't waste your money on this book, unless you have to read it for a class as I did.
J. Gesme		The Sunday Philosophy Club: Books: Alexander McCall Smith		1		Like others, I picked this book up after reading several in the No. <sssss> 1 Ladies...series. <sssss> No comparison. <sssss> The story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book. <sssss> I just don't understand the rest of this book. <sssss> Isabel never even asked the key question to the whole "mystery" until it slapped her in her silly face. <sssss> The mystery for me is - what is the Sunday Philosophy Club, and what in the world does it have to do with this book? <sssss> I'm sorry I spent the time on this - there are important books to be read
Anthony Ten Broeck "math guy"		Fischer Black and the Revolutionary Idea of Finance: Books: Perry Mehrling		1		Poorly proof read and obfuscatingly written, this book had the potential to clarify for the many the importance of Black's contributions. <sssss> It was a frustrating read due to lack of clarity and lack of simple explanations about the significance of Black's work
nicomp@iglou.com		The Secret Ways: Books: Alistair Maclean		2		Alistair MacLean combines psychology, action, history, sociology, and intrigue into a wonderful spy story. <sssss> The hero potrtays a tried and true James Bond without the condescending attitude. <sssss> There's none better
P. L. Hutton "PLH"		Vintage Hats pppppppppp Bonnets 1770-1970: Identification pppppppppp Values: Books: Susan Langley,John Dowling		2		If you're interested in reproducing authentic costumes, you won't find a better guide to hats and bonnets than this book. <sssss> I haven't found anything close to it. <sssss> Intended for collectors, it is full of photographs showing what women wore on their heads for the 200 year period covered. <sssss> Today a hat is usually something worn strictly to protect from inclement weather. <sssss> Until a generation or so ago, no woman felt dressed in public unless she wore some kind of hat. <sssss> It's a valuable addition to any costume library
The General Reader		The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community: Books: William McNeill		2		McNeill calls American Indians and Africans little more than the victims of the West in this book. <sssss> He explains that they have little role in the development of culture (which he sees as passing from society to society from Mesopotamia on, like some sort of conceptual Olympic torch) and some get it and others do not. <sssss> It is an outdated and bigoted way to see cultural history, and difficult to read without cringing. <sssss> That said, the book contains marvelous elements. <sssss> Few writers will explain with his brevity and mastery how cultures have passed elements, one to another, over the expanse of time; few writers can convey the forward momentum of history as McNeil. <sssss> So with all its faults, it is very worthy book, certainly worth reading while keeping in minds its somewhat dramatic shortcomings
Michelle Kinslow		Simply Homemade Food Gifts: Books: Jennifer Darling		1		I was INCREDIBLY disappointed with this book purchase - especially because I paid FULL PRICE for it. <sssss> I have absolutely NO USE for it. <sssss> Why? <sssss> Why pay money for a book that simply takes prepackaged cookie and cake mixes, and adds a handful of nuts or dried fruit, (thus, making it "homemade") to give away? <sssss> Anyone with the smallest amount of natural creativity could do this on their own, without the instruction of a cookbook. <sssss> Let me give you an example: One of the "recipes" in this book is for lollipops. <sssss> You melt down other lollipops or pieces of hard candy and drop a stick in the puddle. <sssss> WOW. <sssss> That is CRAFTY. <sssss> How ridiculous. <sssss> Even worse, - as you will see by the illustration, - the "homemade" 'lollipop' looks disgusting. <sssss> The stick is about four times as thick as the paper-thin puddle of liquified old hard candy. <sssss> I wouldn't DARE give such a thing away as a GIFT. <sssss> Only a handful of recipes in this book are actually scratch-made from ingredients. <sssss> The premise of this book is dressing up premade prepackaged foods from your local grocery store, and slapping some notions from the craft store on a glass jar or paper box. <sssss> While some of the presentation ideas are original and attractive, in general it will prove a grave disappointment to an experienced cook. <sssss> I have given this book two stars because it does present lovely photo illustrations of every "recipe", and may give you inspiration for packaging and presenting your best recipes as gifts...... but if you have any creative talent and cooking skill whatsoever, - I advise you to seek out another book on this subject. <sssss> It is not worth the cost of the book. <sssss> Should you be interested in the simplicity and economical value (the craft notions to dress the package will cost more than the food you are preparing)found in this book, - PLEASE- buy a USED copy, - it isn't worth more than $3 bucks. <sssss> This is definitely a publication for a very inexperienced cook - and it is only for such a one I would recommend this book
Richard Sawyer		Women of the Silk: A Novel: Books: Gail Tsukiyama		2		This is a simple, yet heartfelt and elegant tale of the lives and struggles of women in rural China of the 1920s and 1930s. <sssss> The story centers on Pei, who as a young girl, is sold by her parents to work in a silk factory. <sssss> The story evolves as Pei befriends other women in the silk factory, participates in a strike for fair working conditions, reconnects with her family, loses loved ones, and escapes from advancing Japanese soldiers. <sssss> The plot is succinct and the characters are interesting, varied, and believable, if perhaps lacking somewhat in psychological depth. <sssss> Socio-cultural aspects of life in 1920s-30s China are elegantly woven into the plot. <sssss> Themes of friendship, love, and courage are convincingly presented. <sssss> Overall, the book is a captivating read, and strongly recommended.
Kevin Subers "Kevin"		Boy Meets Girl: Say Hello to Courtship: Books: Joshua Harris		1		Sorry for the sarcastic title. <sssss> I've read most of this book. <sssss> I'm still reading the last chapter which is actually the most hopeful chapter. <sssss> I'll start with what I liked. <sssss> Harris lays out some good suggestions on handling the pyhsical aspects of a dating relationship (or courtship if you get caught up in semantics) However, Harris offers nothing else except a rudimentary courtship model that involves physical boundaries and guarding against things moving too quickly. <sssss> I think this is good wisdom, but the book completely lacks in many other apects of pursuing a relationship. <sssss> He talks very little about communication skills. <sssss> Also you won't find much on personality traits or compatibility. <sssss> When I began a relationship with my girlfriend I read this book. <sssss> I don't regret reading it, but it lacks in a lot of areas. <sssss> Part of this is due to the fact that I don't know what credentials Joshua Harris has to make his claims. <sssss> He is not a Phd, or a relationship or family counselor. <sssss> He had two substantial romantic relationships in his life. <sssss> One with the girl who inspired him to write his first book, and the other with his current wife. <sssss> When it comes to relationships, I would hardly call Joshua Harris and authority on the subject. <sssss> He has no more experience or wisdom that the average person who would pick his book up off the shelf. <sssss> I support the crux of what Harris talks about. <sssss> I respect the fact that him and his wife Shannon waited to their wedding day for their first kiss. <sssss> The book is chivalrous and romantic. <sssss> It is a hopeful book. <sssss> But it paints only a partial picture of how to persue a relationship. <sssss> If you are into reading relationship books, just be sure this isn't your only resource.
Badger		Made in Japan: Akio Morita and Sony: Books: Akio Morita		1		I wavered awhile between three stars and two stars, because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as Sony and Akio Morita seem to deserve at least three. <sssss> However, in the end, the book's errors just piled too high. <sssss> It opens well, with the story of Sony's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half-wrecked department store just after World War II, to becoming one of the world's great companies. <sssss> This is a fascinating and inspiring story, and Morita tells it with flair. <sssss> Then, unfortunately, the downward spiral begins. <sssss> Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every other Japanese company operates the same way, which is a fantastically wrong assertion (as the last thirteen years of Japan's seemingly endless recession have shown). <sssss> He also frequently takes good basic management techniques, like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway, and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely "Japanese". <sssss> Then there are all the claims which are simply out-and-out false, such as Japan supposedly having the world's best construction technology. <sssss> (It actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world, as the Kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated.) <sssss> Or how Japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything. <sssss> (Yet it only recently discovered the concept of "second-hand goods", instead of throwing nearly-new furniture and clothing away. <sssss> Plus, Japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world's worst overpackaging.) <sssss> Reading between the lines, a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that Japan faces today. <sssss> For example, Morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States. <sssss> While this can, of course, sometimes be a serious problem, it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves. <sssss> Japan's consumers, on the other hand, without an accessible court system, are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives. <sssss> Complaints about dangerous products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored, because they lack any threat of legal action. <sssss> In another example, Morita praises the "trust" and agreements without contracts that exist among Japanese corporations. <sssss> In reality, this "trust" is a death pact, as bankrupt inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies, instead of letting them fall and create openings for fresh and innovative entrepreneurs. <sssss> Other than the glimpses into Sony's history and corporate culture, this book is only interesting as a museum piece - yet another in the flood of "Japan is going to take over" books that came out in the Eighties. <sssss> Although, of course, considering all the "Internet companies are going to take over" books that came out in the Nineties, not even this is a uniquely "Japanese" phenomenon. <sssss> PS: Anyone wanting a healthy reality check about the current state of Japan should read "Dogs and Demons" by Alex Kerr.
J. Williams "Spiritual Sampler"		In the Shadow of the Moons: My Life in the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's Family: Books: Nansook Hong		1		Nansook Hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to HyoJin Moon, but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents' machinations to get her married into the Moon family. <sssss> Eyewitnesses tell of Nansook visiting the Moon household and knowing full well of HyoJin's excesses in advance of her marriage. <sssss> The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family, and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first Moon daughter, they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son. <sssss> Though I don't know all the motives, the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that Ms. Hong has not been honest about. <sssss> It is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of Rev Moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect, given her own deceit
G. Tenison		Big Sky: Books: A.B. Jr Guthrie		2		I really enjoyed this work. <sssss> Didnt know this guy won a Pulitzer but it figures. <sssss> I was swept away by the imagery created by this master. <sssss> It was evocative of Cooper (although he surpasses Cooper), and McMurtry and the guy who wrote pppppppppp quot;all the pretty horses pppppppppp quot;. <sssss> The pppppppppp quot;master pppppppppp quot; can always create the world to drown the reader in - this guy is great - I plan to read the whole series..
S. Connell "nicnsib"		Spiritual Midwifery: Books: Ina May Gaskin		1		First, I am a very open-minded person, raised by a hippy/Biker family. <sssss> I really expected to identify with this book. <sssss> While I appreciate the what Ina May's movement accomplished during its time, I felt like the book was almost a joke--verging more on detailing accounts of an occult community--A community of people living on old school buses in the woods, delivering each other's babies. <sssss> The language is terrible---everything is described as "psychedelic," etc--one woman even referred to her female parts using the big "p" word. <sssss> While they try to add a personal touch by including individual narrations, it sounds more like a compilation of uneducated people describing their birth stories the way they were pressured to believe---NOBODY mentions feeling pain during labor. <sssss> Honestly, I feel that the pressure of the community was so intense they wouldn't have admitted to pain if they could. <sssss> Also, many of the accounts were extremely erotic---couple are encouraged to fondle one another during labor to keep connected and relaxed. <sssss> In some accounts, a couple would be making out, while a midwife would massage the birthing mother in her "laboring parts"--turning the woman on and keeping her relaxed. <sssss> Not my cup of tea. <sssss> I had so little respect for the lifestyle and the language of the people that I didn't get much out of the book
Chris Schmidt "Rocky Island"		Saving Faith (Random House Large Print): Books: David Baldacci		1		I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow. <sssss> She didn't say how slow though. <sssss> But rather than take her word for it (why should I? <sssss> After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it. <sssss> How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale. <sssss> I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything. <sssss> I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food
Sparky121		Raindrop Technique: Books: D. Gary Young		1		This is yet another book where anyone who passed a high school bio class will know is crap. <sssss> [...] he seems to have found a devoted crew of morons who believe that he really can cure all. <sssss> If you ever go to one of their conventions, you'll know that its AMWAY for stupid soccer moms with allergic kids.
Rhonda M. Griffin		Descent to the Goddess (Studies in Jungian Psychology): Books: Sylvia Brinton Perera		2		As a therapist (16 yrs), I have been using the material in this book for reframing the experience of depression for my clients. <sssss> The clients I have introduced this book to are now reframing their illness as an intiation into a greater understanding of their relation to self/soul. <sssss> While at times dry for most laypeople, It has become a reference book for my practice
M. Fuller		New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements, The: Books: Stanley M. Burgess,Eduard M. van der Maas,Ed van der Maas		1		Considering that this is virtually the first attempt (as far as I know) at a Dictionary of the Pentecostal/Charismatic movement, this is a good start. <sssss> It is worth the price for what it does contain but it is not without glaringflaws.The title pppppppppp quot;International pppppppppp quot; leads one to expect much more coverage of Pentecost outside of the U.S. Canada, where Pentecostal movements thrived in parallel with those in the U.S., is given very scanty treatment.Some major early Canadian apostles, such as O.J. <sssss> Lovik, are skipped entirely. <sssss> There is also too much opportunity given for some controversial movements to propagandize. <sssss> A balanced article would necessitate an article by an unbiased observer, rather than by the leaders of those movements.Finally, there is too much credence and space given to sociological assessments of a movement that requires, above all else, keen spiritual discernment to separate the wheat from the chaff. <sssss> That said, I will consult my copy often, for the great amount of useful material it does contain
Aidan's Mom		What Do You Do with a Tail Like This? (Caldecott Honor Book): Books: Robin Page,Steve Jenkins		2		Both of my boys love this book and request it over and over again. <sssss> It is such a fun book to read because the children interact with the reader by answering the questions. <sssss> Love it!
K. M. Halbig		Murder at Five Finger Light: A Jessie Arnold Mystery: Books: Sue Henry		1		I have been a fan of Sue Henry since her first Jessie Arnold mystery. <sssss> I was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing. <sssss> The characters were one-dimensional. <sssss> After discovering who the "bad guys" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification. <sssss> Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters. <sssss> "...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours." <sssss> Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted. <sssss> I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little
Pol Sixe "hpolvi"		Alice in Jeopardy: A Novel: Books: Ed McBain		2		Don't get me wrong, this was an enjoyable read. <sssss> Since retiring Matthew Hope I guess EM had an urge to return to SW Florida with this tale. <sssss> Funny adult repartee and a good pppppppppp quot;mystery pppppppppp quot; but only age 9-12 reading level according to the Amazon rating?? <sssss> These latest books from McBain are all very similar and are being churned out at almost a TV-episode rate, but how about trying to stretch a bit
Padmapani S. Ganti "Paddy Ganti"		Unknown Quantity: A Real And Imaginary History of Algebra: Books: John Derbyshire		2		Very few books can weave the historical narrative with an account of the subject as Mr.Derbyshire does it in this book.Whats more, he does total justice to the subject by making sure persons who should get their credit does atleast so. <sssss> The author's canvas is huge and he almost reminded me of how much I missed undergraduate math. <sssss> A must read for students of algebra as this one sets a context which is far brilliant than the dry subject textbook (I myself taught a class in Algebra aat University of New Orleans
BRUCE ST JOHN		Stephen King: America'S Best-Loved Boogeyman: Books: Beahm		1		Didn't care for this book at all. <sssss> If you want to learn about Stephen King you'd be much better off reading or listening to his book pppppppppp quot;On Writing. <sssss> pppppppppp quot
M. Moore		The Way Of The Superior Man: A Spiritual Guide to Mastering the Challenges of Woman, Work, and Sexual Desire: Books: David Deida		2		My order arrived quickly and for a used book it was in excellent shape, looking like new. <sssss> I won't hesitate to order from this company again. <sssss> Thank yo
"physiologyguy"		Evolutionary Analysis (2nd Edition): Books: Scott Freeman,Jon C. Herron		1		Bought this one for Evolution class. <sssss> It is a horrible excuse for a textbook. <sssss> Do not buy this book unless it is for a middle school student. <sssss> If the authors think this book has been written for an advanced audience, then I would suggest that anyone interested in learning evolution not attend University of Washington
kittimama "kittimama"		Edge of Evil: Books: J. A. Jance,Kris Faulkner		1		I own and have read all of JA Jance's JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character's lives. <sssss> I picked this book up, thinking it would be on par with all the JA Jance books I've read previously. <sssss> What a crashing disappointment. <sssss> I can't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told, I kept looking at the cover to see if I'd picked up a Harlequin by mistake. <sssss> I'll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I'd much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn't think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago. <sssss> This one gets a big "Aw, c'mon, JA, you can do much better than this!" <sssss> from me. <sssss> For those who haven't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first JAJ, get the JP Beaumonts and start at the beginning. <sssss> They are worth the time and effort
		Ugly Ways: Books: Tina McElroy Ansa		1		Anyone who knows me would tell you I truly enjoy reading. <sssss> I am an avid reader known to finish an interesting book within hours. <sssss> It took me two weeks to get past the first seven chapters of this book. <sssss> The story just could not keep my interest. <sssss> I felt no real affinity to any of the characters. <sssss> I have other books by this author and come away with an interst in what would happen next with her lead characters. <sssss> She writes with real emphasis on how characters interact with each other and usually leaves you wanting more. <sssss> In the case of this novel I just didn't feel it. <sssss> Her other novels will not leave you dissapointed. <sssss> Ugly ways is not a good example of the Ansa's true talent as a writer. <sssss> If you have not done so try her other novels. <sssss> I guarantee you will come away wanting to read more
Tennyson Lee		Chinese Lessons: Five Classmates and the Story of the New China: Books: John Pomfret		1		This is a story of the lives of 5 people who attended college with the author during the early 1980s in post cultural revolution China. <sssss> The 5 people live relatively miserable lives, touched by official corruption and incompetence (with the exception of one who benefits handsomely). <sssss> China is portrayed as a country filled with desperate people lacking any morality, with widespread corruption, and widespread incompetence. <sssss> This view is difficult to reconcile with the economic development and obvious progress that has occurred there in the past 20 years. <sssss> This book is an interesting read as gossip often can be, but it is doubtful the 5 people portrayed represent present day China
Andrew Manikas		The Partner (Random House Large Print): Books: John Grisham		2		I won't spoil the ending, but some many other reviewers didn't like the twist. <sssss> However, the reader who needs to have everything wrapped up and be 100% happy should read Runaway Jury. <sssss> However, like The Firm (another great book) that ends with the characters on the run and in trouble, this book has a very realistic ending that you didn't expect. <sssss> This was my favorite Grisham book, followed by The Firm, Runaway Jury, and Pelican Brief. <sssss> I found the Broker to be too much of an Italian lesson, the Brethern simplistic, and The Street Lawyer was a giant sermon about helping homeless people - with very little story holding it together. <sssss> If you like the Firm you will like The Partner
Jan L. Kochmeister "Suspense Fan"		The Indwelling: The Beast Takes Possession (Left Behind #7): Books: Tim F. LaHaye,Jerry B. Jenkins		2		This series of books is a beast that has possessed me with its great storylines, characters and cliffhanger endings. <sssss> Kudoes to LaHaye
N. Higgins		The Afghan: Books: Frederick Forsyth		1		"Col Mike Martin" raised in Iraq, speaks fluent arabic......... <sssss> The Taliban are Pashtoon, they are not arabs, they don't speak arabic, they don't even like arabs very much. <sssss> They are a totaly closed tribal society. <sssss> I spent a year living and working with the Pashtoon in 2005 in Helmand Province. <sssss> There are no members of the Taliban who are not Pashtoon. <sssss> The other ethnic groups in Afghanistan, the Tajik and the Hazara, are opposed to the Taliban. <sssss> Mike Martin would not have the correct family, clan and tribal ties and background to carry this off. <sssss> Sorry, but Forsythe has dropped the ball on this one.
VTT		Where You Belong: Books: Barbara Taylor Bradford		2		I don't know why the other reviewers though it was a horrible book. <sssss> It was absolutely captivating! <sssss> I was immediately enthralled in the story, and the has such a profound message.
John Carlson		All the Presidents' Pets: The Story of One Reporter Who Refused to Roll Over: Books: Mo Rocca		1		My friend's and I will pass books back and forth to each other to read if they are good. <sssss> My friend was going to throw this one out instead of passing it along, but since I have a dog, I thought it would be interesting, but it wasn't, so I had the honor of throwing it out myself. <sssss> Typically, I would donate the book or give it to charity, but I don't think anyone would enjoy it. <sssss> It's just this author's drivel. <sssss> It doesn't focus on the president's and their pets at all like the title suggests. <sssss> I could see where another author could have created a really fun book about presidents and their dogs.
ChicBookFiend		Green Darkness: Books: Anya Seton		2		Having read Katherine, I wanted to get my hands on another Anya Seton novel. <sssss> Her words are beautiful and her accurate historical references in the Medieval and Renaissance eras are breathtaking. <sssss> People recommended Green Darkness because of its timeless romance, historical feel and paranormal aspects centered on past lives and reincarnation. <sssss> So I gave Green Darkness a whirl. <sssss> This enormous book (a big trade paperback with over six-hundred pages) enthralled me from beginning to end and I wish it had been longer, that the magic hadn't ended. <sssss> Despite its rather large size and intricate story, the novel ended too soon for me. <sssss> (I like big books, but you have to make sure that you will enjoy the whole thing when getting a large volume.) <sssss> I finished this gem in three sittings. <sssss> The novel's setting begins in the late 1960s (around the year this was first published). <sssss> Richard Mardson takes his beloved wife, the American heiress Celia Taylor, to his estate in Sussex, England. <sssss> There he shows her around the ancient castle that had belonged to his noble family for centuries and introduces her to his friends and peers, all respectable noblemen and women like Richard. <sssss> But something strange begins to happen between them. <sssss> Celia is experiencing deja vu, as though she'd been there before. <sssss> This happens the second she enters the castle. <sssss> At the same time, Richard becomes restless and moody. <sssss> Celia is bewildered by his abrupt change from the once loving man to someone who isolates himself and avoids her. <sssss> Their lives and their marriage could be in shambles, and Celia has to go back to her previous life during Tudor England to figure out what had gone wrong in order to salvage their happiness at present time. <sssss> Her past life is a woman named Celia Bohun who falls for a handsome monk named Stephen (Richard) Mardson. <sssss> Their forbidden love is timeless and the things they go through are staggering. <sssss> There are many twists throughout the novel. <sssss> I have read few novels that had made me go through as many emotions as this one had done. <sssss> Celia and Stephen's love for one another was something truly beautiful and tragic at the same time. <sssss> This novel brought me to tears by the time I finished. <sssss> The building of tension between the protagonists is almost palpable. <sssss> Celia is a very complex heroine. <sssss> She is proud and innocent, but also could be quite the vixen when she sets her mind to it, especially when Stephen is involved. <sssss> Stephen is a tall, dark and gorgeous hero who has taken a vow of chastity for his religion, but his attraction to Celia is undeniable and it is something that torments him. <sssss> This part of his personality makes him a tortured soul and he is very appealing as a result. <sssss> The part in which Celia looks after him when he falls ill is one of the sexiest scenes in the novel. <sssss> It has a mixture of eroticism and innocence, for it is the first time Celia sees Stephen's nude body. <sssss> The romance is indeed wonderful, but the historical references make this novel all the richer and more palatable. <sssss> We experience all of the things that occurred during Tudor England, from Henry VIII's reign passing on to Queen Mary and onto Queen Elizabeth I. I have been reading quite a lot of historical/biographical novels and finding this book was like finding hidden treasure. <sssss> You feel the time period and the events that took place in those times. <sssss> The most insightful things for me were those centered on Queen Mary's persecution of Protestants and all the historical things that occur while time passes after the scandal centered on Celia's love for Stephen. <sssss> The ending is one of the best endings I have read. <sssss> Green Darkness is a true treasure that all historical enthusiasts should own. <sssss> The story is quite intricate, not an easy read by a long shot (I find that most novels that center on reincarnation are very complex), but the overall development of the story is extremely well woven and beautifully executed. <sssss> There are numerous characters in this novel, but I never felt like I had to keep up with them in order to remember them. <sssss> Each character serves his or her purpose and I loved them (or hated them if they were villains). <sssss> The one thing that puzzled me was the emphasis on Mabel's weight. <sssss> I thought plump women were considered prettier in those times. <sssss> And Celia (the twentieth century one) sounds a little too British for an American who'd set foot in England for the first time. <sssss> Other than those negligible details, Green Darkness is perfect. <sssss> Anya Seton was a great author, one of the best in her time. <sssss> I think I like this novel more than Katherine. <sssss> I wonder if Anya Seton and this novel inspired Jude Deveraux to write Remembrance (which I read at the same time as this one), which is another romance centered on soul mates and past lives partly set in the sixteenth century. <sssss> Anyway, Green Darkness is one of the best historical/paranormal novels out there and I cannot recommend this memorable gem enough
kiwanissandy "Go Bucks!"		Real Simple: The Organized Home (Real Simple S.): Books: Editors of Real Simple Magazine		1		The photos are beautiful, the designs are just wonderful...but if you have kids this is not real life. <sssss> This is a magazine lifestyle. <sssss> You could only do this if you had an unlimited budget, there are no true solutions for real families with real children and real budgets. <sssss> Sure my home could be organized if I had an open checkbook and could have such fabulous built-ins, and all the baskets I could buy! <sssss> Stick with the real simple magazine and leave the book for the coffee table.
Christina L. Matyskela		Between Husbands pppppppppp Friends: Books: Nancy Thayer		1		I read this in Jan. of 01 and am just now transcribing my notes. <sssss> Here goes: Trashy, but I couldn't NOT finish it. <sssss> Story of best friends who go to a summer house every August with their families. <sssss> Secret betrayals of friendship, a hidden illness, a birth and a miscarriage. <sssss> What else do you need to make a soap-opera style plot? <sssss> I give Thayer credit for her spot on descriptions of feelings one experiences after miscarriage, from envy to despair. <sssss> Bottom line: Rich people with too much money and rich people problems. <sssss> It didn't stay in my short term memory very long
"shelleygail76"		The Wedding: Books: Danielle Steel		1		This seemed too long and too drawn out
Julie R. Gothrup		Slippery: Books: John Philips III		2		A wild and crazy ride on a submarine stuck in the Arctic ice. <sssss> This book is full of crazy characters! <sssss> Both two legged and four legged. <sssss> A must read for anyone looking adventure in the high Arctic
pattycakes		The Five Chinese Brothers (Paperstar): Books: Claire Huchet Bishop,Kurt Wiese		1		Leaving the racism issue aside, this is not a book for small children. <sssss> Even if everything turns out OK in the end, I'm not prepared to expose my children to issues of capital punishment and the drowning death of a small boy. <sssss> Small children forget the ending and focus on the scary parts in between. <sssss> Perhaps I'm a softie, but let's allow them to be children and not worry about being wrongfully accused of murder and sentenced to death by beheading. <sssss> Just because it's a classic doesn't make it appropriate reading.
S. Caruso		The Twins of Tribeca: A Novel: Books: Rachel Pine		1		This book dragged on and on. <sssss> The ending was stupid and the plot was pathetic. <sssss> Very similiar to The Devil Wears Prada which was also bad. <sssss> Don't waste your time on this one
Thriller Lover		The King of Torts [BARGAIN PRICE] [Hardcover] by GRISHAM, JOHN: Books: JOHN GRISHAM		1		I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment. <sssss> Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story. <sssss> Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits. <sssss> This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees. <sssss> Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients. <sssss> In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline. <sssss> It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall. <sssss> Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving. <sssss> This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone. <sssss> I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs. <sssss> Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend. <sssss> For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr.
D. Daugherty "History Buff"		Lincoln's Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and Fueled His Greatness: Books: Joshua Wolf Shenk		2		This is a pretty good book. <sssss> However, I would have liked it better if the focus would have remained on the effect of Lincoln's depression on his life and that of his family rather than a psychological perspective
"psychmom3"		Developing Talents: Careers for Individuals with Asperger Syndrome and High-Functioning Autism: Books: Temple Grandin,Kate Duffy,Tony Attwood		2		As a parent of an adolescent with Asperger Syndrome, I found this book easy to read and understand, with practical how-to instructions and guidelines for preparing my son to enter the work force. <sssss> I really liked the emphasis on developing social and communication skills that are found throughout the book. <sssss> This is one I will recommend to friends and relatives as well as my son's educators
Shalom Freedman "Shalom Freedman"		The "Jewish Threat": Anti-Semitic Politics of the U.S. Army: Books: Joseph W. Bendersky		2		I would strongly recommend that anyone interested in this book read the review of this book by M. Goldin on H- Net.It is comprehensive and comes from someone who served in an Armed Forces combat unit during the Second World War. <sssss> This book chronicles the negative and prejudiced attitudes held by various figures of the Army throughout the past century. <sssss> These attitudes may have been important in effecting the lives of individual soldiers at the unit level. <sssss> They too may have had certain effect on overall U.S. policy in such matters as bombing the rail lines into Auschwitz. <sssss> There were also efforts to influence negatively American attitudes towards the emerging Jewish state in Israel. <sssss> This is in a way a sad and yet important book to read. <sssss> It chronicles how that fundamental American ideal of equal treatment of the individual human being was violated by prejudice, and ignorance.
Paul Sas "The tapeworm"		Good Business: Leadership, Flow and the Making of Meaning: Books: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi		1		One can't be sure that this book isn't deliberately exploiting a cynical belief that most business books are so bad, that if this weren't crappy, it wouldn't sell. <sssss> Even for someone who believes in Csik's theory of flow, this book is a no-win blow-out. <sssss> Instead of making clear statements backed by evidence, the book's tone and presentation are mere editorializing assertions. <sssss> There is no reason to read this, when his original popularization, Flow, more carefully and clearly summarizes Csikszentmihalyi's interesting research.
Timothy Hernandez "metimoteo"		The Wolves in the Walls (New York Times Best Illustrated Books (Awards)): Books: Neil Gaiman,Dave McKean		2		The quirky illustrations done by the masterful Dave McKean at once contribute to the book's charm, but also lend to its dread. <sssss> However, this is not a book for especially wee ones or children prone to nightmares. <sssss> Some people may not appreciate Dave McKean's artwork as much as they should, because it is so different, at least to those not familiar with the Sandman graphic novel series written by Neil Gaiman in which Dave McKean did the cover art for all the books. <sssss> At first glance the layout might seem confusing, even distracting, yet it somehow works here. <sssss> Neil Gaiman has crafted an eerie tale that befits his style of writing. <sssss> He introduces us to a charming young girl named Lucy, who suspects something is not right with her home. <sssss> And though her pig-puppet seems to share her concern and understands her fear, the rest of her family do not...until it's too late. <sssss> The action waxes and wanes until all seems resolved in the end, though perhaps it is not. <sssss> You be the judge. <sssss> This is a worthy book to read to third-graders and above, though some younger children may be able to stomach the tale without any concern. <sssss> Neil Gaiman deserves praise for bringing his brand of storytelling to a younger audience, one so unfamiliar with his other work. <sssss> I highly recommend this book
Sarah Price "Mrs. Fit"		The Diet Alternative: With Study Guide: Books: Diane Hampton		2		Give up dieting forever! <sssss> I have and I am now losing weight eating anything, yes anything, I want. <sssss> Can you imagine eating anything you want and not being frightened? <sssss> This is the book that will set you free, this is the book you need. <sssss> Has it struck you that dieting is unnatural? <sssss> Don't eat this, don't eat that, count this, count that, measure this, measure that, I can't have this, and I can't have that, ad nauseum. <sssss> Which diet guru are you going to believe? <sssss> Can you reall stay with a low-carb diet or a high-carb diet or calorie counting the rest of your life? <sssss> Most importantly, do you want to stick to a restricted diet the rest of your life? <sssss> The first day of my new eating pattern I ate two meals. <sssss> The second day, I woke up with no hunger, no reactive hypoglycemia (nausea and shakes from hunger)! <sssss> What a miracle. <sssss> I have shifted to an apple for lunch and anything I want for dinner (I love to cook and desire to eat with my family). <sssss> At maintenance, I may end up eating two meals a day; I don't know and it certainly isn't something to pppppppppp quot;worry pppppppppp quot; about. <sssss> The diet gurus that say one meal will cause you to overeat later, etc., are wrong, wrong, wrong. <sssss> Maybe it sounds theoretically correct, but it does not work that way. <sssss> Listen, I have found out the less you eat, the less you eat. <sssss> I do eat to satisfaction at dinner and it does not stretch my stomach. <sssss> By the way, Dr. Dean Edell stated on his radio show that he only eats one meal a day himself. <sssss> He says there is NO scientific proof that X number of meals are better than one. <sssss> Also, I want you dear readers to know that I have four friends who are pppppppppp quot;naturally pppppppppp quot; slim (adult women - 30's and 40's). <sssss> Two of them eat a small amount for lunch (like a small hamburger) and a good dinner (they are sizes 3 and 6). <sssss> One gal eats at 2:30 PM, a huge amount, and a snack at night (she is size 7). <sssss> One gal does nibble all day, like a potato chip here and there (no thank you, personally). <sssss> Oh, and a relative who is size 4 eats breakfast and dinner, never lunch. <sssss> Remember my comeback for sabotagers: pppppppppp quot;Slim people don't need much food, even if we exercise. <sssss> Who says a certain number of meals a day are better than one or two? <sssss> pppppppppp quot; The only negative thing I have to say about Diane's book is that I felt she took scripture out of context. <sssss> God fed the Israelites manna 2X a day; they were supernaturally filled and nourished. <sssss> He does not feed anyone manna today. <sssss> Also, biblical gluttony is not overeating (I do believe a lifestyle of overeating is sin, but not gluttony). <sssss> Biblical gluttony refers to the Roman-type parties where people overate, overdrank and went on to commit more sin. <sssss> On the positive side, I do believe Diane tries steer away from legalism and authoritarianism. <sssss> This book is an answer to prayer. <sssss> You won't be sorry if you buy this book
Harriet Klausner		Stage Fright: A Cambridge Mystery: Books: Christine Poulson		2		While on maternity leave from Cambridge University and with her husband away handling a legal matter in Los Angeles, Professor Cassandra James meets her neighbor actress Melissa Meadows and her spouse Keith Kingleigh. <sssss> Melissa and Cassandra share an affinity since both recently gave birth prematurely. <sssss> Kevin is going to direct a production starring Melissa. <sssss> He asks Cassandra to adapt the Victorian drama East Lynn, which she agrees to do. <sssss> As opening night beckons, Cassandra notices the cast seems extra nervous. <sssss> Later an anxious Melissa calls Cassandra believing that someone is stalking her. <sssss> Cassandra tries to calm her down. <sssss> The next day Melissa fails to appear for a rehearsal so Cassandra goes to visit her. <sssss> Melissa is gone without a word, but abandoned her six month old baby that she had shown so much love. <sssss> With her own fussy infant at her side, Cassandra wonders what happened to her new friend while unable to contact Stephen, dealing with the abrupt arrival of her first husband, and Detective Sergeant Vickers suspecting the professor killed the actress. <sssss> STAGE FRIGHT, the second Professor James tale (see MURDER IS ACADEMIC), is a fabulous amateur sleuth mystery that builds up the suspense slowly so that the reader like the heroine suspects everyone's motives. <sssss> Either foul play occurred or Melissa had played the role of a loving mother, but Cassandra cannot find a motive for either scenario while the evidence points towards her so that even the audience will believe she harmed or murdered the actress. <sssss> This is a fantastic English mystery in the Christie tradition. <sssss> Harriet Klausner
z "literature lover"		A Year by the Sea: Thoughts of an Unfinished Woman: Books: Joan Anderson		1		A friend recommended this book which I unfortunately bought. <sssss> I feel sorry for people who think that this is "writing." <sssss> The author not only contradicts herself but the writing is shallow and lacks any depth. <sssss> If you want to feel good, buy yourself a bottle of wine, not this book
John Harrison "reader1963"		The Historian: Books: Elizabeth Kostova		2		I just finished reading the Hitorian. <sssss> The first 400 pages were so compelling, that I could hardly put it down. <sssss> Then..... it became soooo boring. <sssss> It literally took me the same amount of time to get through the next 200 pages as the first 400. <sssss> I just had to keep putting it down and shaking my head, thinking this has to get better, considering how good the first 2/3rd's were. <sssss> I also have to say that I was disappointed with the ending - it was way too contrived for me... <sssss> SPOILER ALERT*** - I found it EXTREMELY unbelievable that Dracula would 'assume' that Helen died in the fall and not gone after her, as the author states when Helen is recounting how she made it out alive from the fall. <sssss> I mean, come on... Dracula is supposedly all knowing and has tracked this woman all over the world. <sssss> Now were supposed to believe that he simply says "damn, she fell - I guess after all I've been through, I won't bother to check - I'll just find another victim" - sorry, didn't buy it and it really was a big let down after so much potential in the beginning.. <sssss> Overall, the book was really great. <sssss> Fascinating reading for the Dracula fan. <sssss> Just wish the ending held up to the beginning.
P. N. Anderson		The Chamber (Airport Only): Books: John Grisham		2		This book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on "death row," at least in the state of Mississippi, and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences. <sssss> It touches on activities of the Ku Klux Klan. <sssss> It was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty. <sssss> However, some sympathy is found for the victims of crime. <sssss> The story centers on Sam Cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime. <sssss> Sam's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from "death row." <sssss> The latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution. <sssss> Meanwhile Sam shows repentance and response to the prison's chaplain. <sssss> I found it to be one of the better John Grisham books.
Ronald L. Henderson		Managing the Software Process: Books: Watts S. Humphrey		2		If you wish to improve the Quality of your software development, this book is worth reading, studying, and questioning. <sssss> It realy does not tell you how or why to improve, but suggest processes and measures that you need to concider if you are already commited to better software
Shalom Freedman "Shalom Freedman"		The Jew in American Sports: Books: Harold U. Ribalow,Meir Ribalow		2		This was a childhood favorite of mine which I frequently read in the Library of the Troy Jewish Community Center 87 First Street. <sssss> I can remember sitting there and reading about such questionable greats as Harry Danning, Sid Gordon and Moe Berg. <sssss> Of course there were undoubted greats like Hank Greenberg and Sid Luckman. <sssss> And there was in boxing too Barney Ross and Benny Leonard. <sssss> Perhaps there are more up- to- date books about Jews in sports but I doubt there are any which tell a story as well, and give the young person such a warm feeling about the Jewish contribution to what seemed at that time of life, the most important form of human activity.
Catherine S. Vodrey		Armadale (Oxford World's Classic): Books: W. Wilkie Collins,Catharine Peters		2		Collins' efforts with his justly famed pppppppppp quot;The Moonstone pppppppppp quot; and pppppppppp quot;The Woman in White pppppppppp quot; have perhaps overshadowed his very fine work as seen in pppppppppp quot;Armadale. <sssss> pppppppppp quot; Lydia Gwilt (don't you love the last name?) <sssss> is one of the great unsung characters in English (or any western) literature. <sssss> Collins seems to delight in making her as full-bodied, as attractive to men, and as dangerous as he can without ever losing his grip and falling over the slippery precipice into satire. <sssss> Given the tenor and social conventions of the time, her quest for revenge on the despicable Alan Armadale seems perfectly in keeping. <sssss> Lydia Gwilt is like an early, English Scarlett O'Hara without the redeeming humor Scarlett was known to exhibit. <sssss> All in all, an extraordinarily well-written and three-dimensional character study
Skip		Presumed Innocent: Books: Scott Turow		1		I thought this book was going to be a great Legal Thriller, but little did I know that it would turn out to be the worst book I have ever read. <sssss> I expected a lot more out of Scott Turow, who wrote "One L", which I loved, but this book was plan boring. <sssss> The begining started out slow and it never picked up from there! <sssss> The worst Legal Thriller, ever
Theresa Clare "islandgrrrl"		Writing My Love: Books: Claire McNab		1		I am a long-time admirer of Claire McNab's writing -- despite the fact I have been disappointed in the direction (or lack of it) in which she has taken the Carol Ashton mystery series. <sssss> Although she is more known in the U.S. for her mystery and espionage books, her novel "Under the Southern Cross" is a bang-up, great romance delivered in her typically spare (or is it stingy?) <sssss> style. <sssss> I was excited to see she had written another romance and not a mystery with a 10-second sex scene thrown in. <sssss> But, when I got to the last line of this book I found myself closing it and thinking that I had once again been suckered by past memories of Claire McNab. <sssss> This book has a lot of promise to it -- therefore the two stars I gave it -- but it's promise unfulfilled. <sssss> There is a long setup of the writer Vonny Smith pining for the personal attention of her editor, Diana. <sssss> But, why exactly is she in love with Diana? <sssss> Darn if I know. <sssss> The writing has great humor and spoofs the whole genre of romance novels. <sssss> But the entire novel is a setup and, in the end, there is no delivery. <sssss> It's annoying, frustrating, and feels like a cheat. <sssss> Wasn't there an editor to say: "Claire, this story needs more!" <sssss> Or was Bella Books just intent on cashing in on Ms. McNab's name? <sssss> Who knows. <sssss> But, this is one book I won't be rereading. <sssss> I wish I hadn't paid full-price
Jeanette C.		The Starter Wife: Books: Gigi Levangie Grazer,Susan Ericksen		1		Middle-aged Gracie is a typical Hollywood wife, right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe. <sssss> When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage, Gracie finds herself without love, without friends, and most importantly, without status. <sssss> (But at least she's still got the money!) <sssss> Actually, most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish. <sssss> The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes it's hard to follow. <sssss> The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they're impossible to relate to. <sssss> The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly, lacking polish, wit, or interest. <sssss> Especially irritating is Grazer's insistence on using Gracie's name as much as possible. <sssss> For example: "Gracie thought about it; they'd never been to marriage counseling. <sssss> Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome. <sssss> More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too much personality. <sssss> Gracie said and did pretty much what Gracie pleased, in the beginning. <sssss> Before Gracie learned The Way of the Wife" (p 38). <sssss> I lost interest after about 20 pages, plowed my way through 40 more, then gave up. <sssss> It's very obvious that this is a poorly-veiled autobiography (Grazer/Gracie) and that as a Hollywood wife, Grazer DOES have the connections and clout her protagonist lacks or this book would never have been published. <sssss> Definitely not worth your time
Mark Gospri		Running with Scissors: A Memoir: Books: Augusten Burroughs		1		THis book was horrible. <sssss> If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have. <sssss> I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend. <sssss> I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire. <sssss> One less copy in the world...don't waste your money. <sssss> I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes. <sssss> THis book wasted my life
Nopasho		The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread: Books: Peter Reinhart,Ron Manville		1		As a professional, certified chef and baker, I am also an avid baking and cookbook collector. <sssss> After seeing that this book won and the James Beard and the 'IACP Cookbook of the Year' awards -both prominently displayed on the cover of this book- and after reading the 'too good to be true'-reviews on Amazon -some reviewers sound so exalted and in trance as if Peter Reinhart is the Jesus Christ of Bread- I finally decided to buy this expensive book. <sssss> What a dissappointment! <sssss> For all those blindly following Reinhart as he were the Saviour of True Bread, wake up! <sssss> Reinhart's book is simply flawed. <sssss> Compared to other bread books, it's even a quite average book. <sssss> But one that is luxuriously packaged. <sssss> A lot of hot colorful expensive air. <sssss> And it's expensive not because of the info and exlusive bread knowledge in it, but because of the super luxuriously editing. <sssss> This is a book for book enthousiasts, not for bakers, professional or home. <sssss> I see baking and cookbooks mainly as working tools, as information and inspiration. <sssss> Not as eye candy. <sssss> If you want nice pictures, buy an art book. <sssss> A book on baking bread with these awards behind it, should give you tons of new info about ingredients and techniques, original insights, an appetite for baking, factual info, the newest and tested developments in technique... What you get here is a fluffed up egotrip. <sssss> 47 formulas and ample bread info packaged into a shining 30-40$ publishing hype. <sssss> Don't get me wrong: this is a beautiful, expensive book. <sssss> But one you don't use in the kitchen, and certainly don't smudge with butter but put on the coffee table in the living room to impress guests and have polite conversations about. <sssss> But as a source of new information or enlightening up to date bread knowledge, giving pointers about using new bread ingredients combined with old proven bread baking techniques, as a working tool sweating near the hot oven at home or at a bakery, compared to other bread books, this book fails miserably info-wise. <sssss> But it has a snappy lay out. <sssss> Jeff Hamelmans 'Bread, a Book of Techniques' and Rose Beranbaums 'Bread Bible' give the readers much more practical info and insight into bread baking. <sssss> They talk more about the subject 'bread'. <sssss> And not about themselves like Peter Reinhart clearly relishes. <sssss> Mr Reinhart clearly sees himself as so important and interesting a person that we read in this book about his wife and their sightseeing in Paris. <sssss> How about the bread info, the kneading, rising, baking, ingredient- and techniques info? <sssss> I honestly prefer industrious bakers who pass on their baking knowledge clearly without having to read at which hotel room they stayedin. <sssss> Bakers with such big ego's that think that readers of a Bread Baking book are more interested in the shopping experiences of the wife during 'a learning trip' to professional bakers on which she accompanied him, than in another bread formula's, should work in shobizz, not in a bakery or a culinary school. <sssss> Big ego's with more talk than substance galore in the food industry. <sssss> Reinart is, judging by this book, sadly also one of them. <sssss> I don't see in a 1000 years Rose Beranbaum in one of her books rambling on about her husbands prefered color of ties or Jeff Hamelman writing in a bread book about the time he spent with his wife in Paris. <sssss> Mr.Reinhart: your readers forked out 30-40$ for bread info, not your personal travel experiences. <sssss> As you as a teachers no doubts sometimes say to a pupil: Stay with the subject! <sssss> And the subject of this book, for which I paid is 'Bread and Baking. <sssss> If we want to know about your personal life, we'll read an interview in People, if they find you interesting enough. <sssss> Peter Reinharts 'The Bread Baker's Apprentice' as a 'Bread Book' is simply a marketing creation. <sssss> Smartly edited, but way too short on substance. <sssss> There is not much new information on bread. <sssss> Worse: there is not much info at all! <sssss> In total for 30-40 $, you get exactly 47 formulas on 307 pages of which 2 color photo pages are simply ads for other books by Ten Speed Press, the editor or this book. <sssss> Compared to Beranbaums 640 pages, Hamelmans 400 plus pages, that is a big difference for a big price. <sssss> With Reinharts book, you get a lot of shining white surface that in other Bread books is filled with bread info. <sssss> As a buyer of this book, you also pay for full page black-and-white and color pictures that are pure filler. <sssss> See p. 3, 6, 26... And why is the beautiful model Fumie on the cover of a bread book and not mr. Reinhart himself or even ... bread alone? <sssss> With Reinharts next book they will no doubt put Kate Moss in an apron and a bakers vest. <sssss> Package the air attractive enough and the readers will swallow it and fork out the 30-40$. <sssss> Never mind the content. <sssss> Let's talk a bit about the formula's. <sssss> That should be an important part of a baking book, right? <sssss> And they should be original and fine tuned, right? <sssss> Sadly to say: nothing new or original here. <sssss> Some aren't even fine tuned. <sssss> And baking is all about fine tuning. <sssss> Worse, almost all the formula's can be found in other bread books. <sssss> And, most insulting for a buyer of this book, a lot of the mere 47 formulas (Reinhart uses this expensive word because 'recipe' propably doesn't fit into the marketing of this baking book) in this book are rehashed or directly derived from Reinharts former book 'Crust and Crumb'. <sssss> Clever marketing and ba-da-bing! <sssss> By the way, 'Crust and Crumb' has been reedited in 2006. <sssss> At a fair price, I admit. <sssss> So if you want your dose of Reinhart at a right price without the pomp, sc?nes of a marriage, without Peter Reinharts comment on the Eiffel tower so to speak... buy 'Crust and Crumb' and leave this luxuriously edited egotrip on the shelves. <sssss> But before I buy I would also first flip through Beranbaums and Hamelmans bread books in the bookshop or in the Amazon shop. <sssss> As for this book, you should ask yourself: 'Do I want a serious bread book or a nice coffeetable book?'. <sssss> Taking in consideration all the egostroking in this book and in reviews, as a baking book for the world market, this book is almost worthless. <sssss> The universal accepted working standard in worldwide baking is metric weight. <sssss> Like it or not, but that's a fact. <sssss> You weigh your ingredients carefully by grams, kilo's etc. <sssss> Reinhart visited French top bakers Poilane and Gosselin, clearly admires them and aspires to reach their level of baking. <sssss> I don't think that Poilane measures in cups and ounces! <sssss> But even then, let Reinhart measure in cups for the home market. <sssss> But then have the decency to add the metric equivalent in the formula's itself for the rest of the world. <sssss> This guy goes on and on about his wish to bake authentic European inspired bread like ciabatta, fougasse... About a Worldwide Bread Revolution! <sssss> And then he refuses to use the most important tool to make these breads: the same language, the metric weight system. <sssss> Rose Beranbaum places the metric equivalent next to the cups/ounces. <sssss> It's a simple as that. <sssss> Bread is a world food, so use the world standard for baking. <sssss> If not, market your book mainly to the USA market and be honest and upfront about that. <sssss> And don't give us that inflated hot air babble about a Worldwide Bread Revolution without using the worldwide accepted working standard, the metric wieght system! <sssss> This big flaw makes the book almost useless for bakers outside the USA. <sssss> The Worldwide Bread Revolution won't be for tommorrow if we have to use this book worldwide! <sssss> Next point: Reinhart advocates instant yeast over fresh pressed yeast. <sssss> Every baker worth his salt (or yeast) will tell you that fresh yeast gives a far better taste, volume and texture. <sssss> Yeast is a living organism. <sssss> As 'instant yeast' it has been dried and put on the shelves for God knows how long. <sssss> It's like you force a just woken up coma-patient, that has been dormant for months, years... to run a marathon. <sssss> Fresh, pressed yeast is still alive and its taste and texture are a world of difference compared to 'instant' (aka dried) yeast. <sssss> Try the difference between fresh yeast and instant yeast for taste and texture and fully developed rising at home, and judge for yourself. <sssss> To place fresh yeast on the same level as instant yeast is preposterous for someone like Reinhart who spends days on his pre ferments! <sssss> For scientific back up, you can always read the recently translated book of world renowed food scientist Herve This 'Molecular Gastronomy, Exploring the Science of Flavor' (Columbia University Press 2006). <sssss> And it gets worse. <sssss> Reinhart frequently uses shortening instead of butter or olive oil in his breads. <sssss> If Poilane hears this, he'll drop dead! <sssss> Every baker knows that even a small amount of butter gives a much better taste and texture than shortening. <sssss> Shortening produces a rancid/metallic taste and a slimy, unpleasant mouthfeel. <sssss> Not to talk about health. <sssss> Most shortening is choc full of trans fats which are much more unhealty than butter fat. <sssss> Read Harvard's nutrition professor Walter Willets book: 'Eat, Drink and be Healthy' (Free Press 2001). <sssss> New York has already picked this info up. <sssss> Professional food writer and teacher Reinhart hasn't or doesn't care. <sssss> For instance, Reinhart proudly declares -not as a joke- that in Italian bread you can use shortening instead of olive oil. <sssss> In Italian Bread! <sssss> Come on, let's be serious. <sssss> And this guy teaches at the Culinary Institute of America! <sssss> It's like he is advocating spam to put on the BBQ instead of beef! <sssss> If that is the standard of baking that Reinhart uses, he'll have to wait a long time to reach the standards of a Poilane. <sssss> Then there is Reinharts Hygi?ne Problem. <sssss> There is an international standard for basic hygiene in food called the Hazzard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP). <sssss> Reinhart as a professional tutor and teacher must no doubt know the HACCP by heart. <sssss> The first thing in hygiene that an apprentice baker learns, is that before even touching ingredients, he must remove all the rings on his fingers. <sssss> Because the place underneath a wedding band for instance, is the place where the filth gathers and bacteria feast. <sssss> And kneading dough with all that filth underneath a wedding band that you keep on, is not only very dangerous for the health of customers, it is simply not done for a baker. <sssss> I like my bread without filth baked in, thank you very much! <sssss> In the school where I earned my diplome in baking, if a student had a ring on during practical class, he had to leave the class immediately and he lost important points for his exam. <sssss> Yet we see professional teacher and Bread Book Author Reinhart kneading dough WITH HIS WEDDING BAND ON! <sssss> See p. 36-37, 82-83, 255, 245... <sssss> Unforgivable in a 'professional' baking book. <sssss> And all the more in an expensive book that won the James Beard and IACP awards! <sssss> Has anyone of the juries of the James Beard Foundation and the IACP, any basic knowledge of food hygiene? <sssss> Has nobody seen this cardinal sin against food hygi?ne in a so called 'professional Bread Book'? <sssss> One other thing, for a bread book that pretends to be world class, there is no word about gluten-free bread. <sssss> Not one formula. <sssss> And this while more and more people are allergic to gluten (protein in wheat flour). <sssss> To end on a positive note, one thing I found acceptable in this expensive coffee table book, was his 55 pages with the 12 stages of bread. <sssss> But, fellow reviewers, you can find all this info and more, and explained more clearly, more detailed and to the point, in Hamelmans 'Bread' and Beranbaums 'Bread Bible'. <sssss> And it doesn't take 55 pages of expensive high quality shining white paper. <sssss> Peter, take out all the white empty space, learn to write more clearly and to the point, and you can say the same thing in 20 pages. <sssss> Which leaves you 35 pages for more formula's for example. <sssss> But if you haven't any formula's left or are preparing a new book, then, yes, by all means stretch the 12 stages of bread to 55 scarcely printed pages instead of 20. <sssss> Why make it simple if you can make it seem difficult, impress your not so knowledgable readers and in doing so stroking your own ego? <sssss> So despite all the hoopla, hyped reviews, near hysterical praise and important awards, this is simply a too expensive, show off-book. <sssss> It's like the tale of 'the King with no Clothes on'. <sssss> Somebody has to yell: 'Hey, wait a minute!' <sssss> If you want good books on bread baking: buy one by Jeff Hamelman, Rose Beranbaum and Bernard Clayton. <sssss> You don't get a model on the cover, but the content is all the better. <sssss> And in a bread book, isn't content more important than packaging
B. Chandler "xyzzy"		The dancing wu li masters: An overview of the new physics: Books: Gary Zukav		1		Gary Zukav states in his introduction "I had never studied physics. <sssss> In fact I didn't like science and I had no mathematical aptitude. <sssss> On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth. <sssss> I noticed that some reviewers refer to the "New Physics" is that like "New Age" or voodoo physics? <sssss> 90% of the matter must be missing from this book. <sssss> Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. <sssss> He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose. <sssss> Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do not. <sssss> You now know what Zukav wished physics was. <sssss> Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. <sssss> And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats. <sssss> At least get it straight before mixing it up. <sssss> Try reading some of these: "The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski". <sssss> The book available everywhere the DVD's available from the UK. <sssss> "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer) Or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion. <sssss> Then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: "The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra. <sssss> Also on the fringe but not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep." <sssss> (both in books and on video)
Michael Friedman "Bubikon"		White Noise (Contemporary American Fiction): Books: Don DeLillo		1		I wish I could have back the numerous tedious hours slogging through White Noise to the bitter, bitter end. <sssss> Not since Jane Smiley's Moo has such a dull tome been written aobut, among other things, Ameican academia. <sssss> Little happens of note. <sssss> No one cares about the cardboard characters. <sssss> Someone gets shot in the belly, for no good reason. <sssss> And yet this is fawnedover as a comic masterpiece by, among others, The New York Times. <sssss> I ahve been told to read White Noise before I picked up Underworld. <sssss> Have no fear. <sssss> I'll undergo root canal without Novocain before I try that one on for size. <sssss> I've been reading nothing but plumber's trade journals and German magazines just to try to get the taste of this novel out of my mouth for the past few days. <sssss> I'm thinking of getting the definitive Curious George collection just so I don't have to read any words. <sssss> At least that guy in the big yellow hat knew enough to keep his mouth shut, unlike that noncompoop Jack Gladney and his boring friends. <sssss> If people prersist in thinking this is great literature, I suggest giving up reading altogether.
Sean L.		I is for Innocent (Kinsey Millhone Mysteries (Paperback)): Books: Sue Grafton		1		Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. <sssss> Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. <sssss> They show off Grafton's writing talents much better
snowblaze		The Control of Nature: Books: John McPhee		2		My fav essay was about pppppppppp quot;the pppppppppp quot; River. <sssss> Also, now when watching the evening news, the link between fire and flood makes alot of sense. <sssss> Thanks for the enlightenment
K. Butler		The Ordinary: Books: Jim Grimsley		1		I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down. <sssss> Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that. <sssss> The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour. <sssss> It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. <sssss> There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I've ever read. <sssss> The book just stops. <sssss> Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel. <sssss> It's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with. <sssss> In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both, but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae. <sssss> Once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN' PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--but enough about that. <sssss> Gee, what a lovely sofa..
J. Breederland "Cal gal"		Junie B Jones Collection Books 1-4: Books: Barbara Park,Lana Quintal		1		Why someone would chose these books is beyond me, especially when there are so many other good choices. <sssss> Literature has an impact on people and the only impact I can imagine Junie having on others is negative. <sssss> My daughter's first grade teacher is reading the Stupid Smelly School Bus to her class right now. <sssss> Wanting to be an involved parent, I borrowed a copy from the friend and read it too. <sssss> Junie is a brat. <sssss> She thinks like a brat and acts like a brat. <sssss> Our family says, "Thanks, but no thanks!
Stephen Godjas "ShaolinFiveA"		Acupressure Techniques: A Self-Help Guide: Books: Julian Kenyon		2		This is a very handy little book to have for your medical library. <sssss> It is easy to follow, has a nice index to look up your particular problem and doesn't bog the reader down with a huge history and medical jargon of accupressure. <sssss> It has easy to use pictures too. <sssss> I have used it already to help my annoying neck and shoulder pain! <sssss> Sure beats a $50.00 office visit (and most likely, a 3rd or 4th) to your doctor :
Z. Romano "dances with cats"		The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (Oprah's Book Club): Books: Carson McCullers		2		This is a book about beauty, passion, a longing for the thing that a true artist or lover of the arts, especially music, craves and feels, the fire that burns within. <sssss> A book that dares to take one, if one dares to take that step, on a journey deep into the bare souls of it's characters. <sssss> The story that unfolds is not a story that has a specific plot, or develops into dramatic changes for the characters. <sssss> That is not what the author wanted to convey, and one should approach this book as one would a tale of a little piece of humanity, and not expect the characters to travel actively without. <sssss> The book gives us these people, the town, the surroundings. <sssss> It brings us deep into the realities, the thoughts, the complexities of the human soul. <sssss> The people are good, bad, ugly, beautiful, selfish, depressed, found, or lost. <sssss> But from the moment the reader of this book feels the passion for music in Mick Kelly's soul, and her yearning to soar above the squalor and desperation of the small town, then the author reveals her own soul with her words, for those that pick up on what her words show. <sssss> I am still amazed at the power this book has. <sssss> Any other readers here who have written that they failed to understand why one should bother reading this book, should perhaps make due with fast moving action books or glossy novels about the rich and famous. <sssss> For me, this book will always be the book that made me capable of understanding how a writer weaves words together with her soul
Harlowe		Dark Desire: Books: Christine Feehan		1		This book is simply horrible. <sssss> Repetitive dialogue and situations. <sssss> Characters that just make you groan and roll your eyes. <sssss> I've read two by this author and she's just awful. <sssss> Both books used the same lines over and over again. <sssss> The stories chased their tails in circles half the time. <sssss> Dull, repetitive and annoying.
Martin Goldberg		The Motley Fools Rule Breakers Rule Makers : The Foolish Guide To Picking Stocks: Books: David Gardner,Tom Gardner		1		I recently saw this book on the bargain bin. <sssss> This book was pure garbage, by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits. <sssss> Basically they are saying valuations don't matter. <sssss> Since they wrote the book, it has been prooven that their philosophy, approached over the long term, produces some great damaging losses. <sssss> The book may be useful during the next bubble, which if history serves, will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky. <sssss> To the dungeon with these two knaves
Sarah Levinson Slosberg		The Big Box (Jump at the Sun): Books: Toni Morrison		1		The message meant more to me than to my young children. <sssss> They didnt understand why the children were being locked in a box. <sssss> They think playing in cardboard boxes is fun, not a punishment for exercising too much freedom. <sssss> I could see using the book as a basis for discussion, but I think it may just scare children that they too could be locked up by their parents
		Casenote Legal Briefs: Contracts - Keyed to Farnsworth and Young: Books: Casenotes		1		If the author's misuse of the apostrophe in the title is any indication of how they wrote the rest of the book, I would stay away
Julie		Invisible Enemies: Stories of Infectious Disease: Books: Jeanette Farrell		2		I picked up this book looking at the cover trying to figure out his picture. <sssss> I then looked at the titleee and it clicked. <sssss> I read this for school and it wasn't hard to finish it because it amazed me with what everything really was. <sssss> Usually I read fiction books that have diseases or disorders in them. <sssss> I figured that there should be some explaination for me. <sssss> It wasnt hard to follow. <sssss> Also everything was explained very well. <sssss> I didn't have any real background other than the fictions books that you really couldn't go by
Poetess Cute		What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day: Books: Pearl Cleage,Tracey Leigh		2		I was given this book by a friend as a going away gift. <sssss> The day I decided to read it, I was ill and lay on the couch reading it in one sitting. <sssss> I was a bit drowsy, but I could not but it down...It made me nervous, excited, sad, and happy...all the emotions that a good book or movie can offer. <sssss> Get this if you are a serious reader looking for a fictional escape
moose/squirrel		Leaves of Grass: The First (1855) Edition (Penguin Classics): Books: Walt Whitman,Malcolm Cowley		2		Whitman is not the world's greatest poet - that's probably Shakespeare - but he's certainly been the most influential American poetic voice over the past century. <sssss> He was the first poet to take all of American life as his subject. <sssss> Ever the Romantic, Whitman was also the first poet to bring Romanticism into line with everyday reality. <sssss> His narcissism can be annoying, but his panoramic descriptions of life and the imagination have a singularly cumulative power. <sssss> Some of his short poems ("A Noiseless Patient Spider" and "To a Locomotive in Winter")are individually memorable. <sssss> The longer poem "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed," indirectly about the Lincoln assassination, is brilliant. <sssss> I think most of his Civil War poems are overpraised, but "Come Up from the Fields, Father" is a masterpiece of its kind. <sssss> On the negative side, Whitman's transcendental philosophy, which he likes to indulge at length, will strike many readers as very sappy. <sssss> His style, lots of details piled up on top of one another, grows monotonous, and readers who criticize his lack of traditional poetic craftsmanship cannot just be brushed off. <sssss> My advice is to not to try to get through it all at once. <sssss> The poems rarely become "difficult," they just tend to blur one into the other. <sssss> Which may actually have been Whitman's intention. <sssss> Overall,there's never been a book quite like "Leaves of Grass," in any edition, and that's why it keeps selling as a true classic. <sssss> In other words, a very old book that people still buy and read and enjoy even when no teacher is telling them to. <sssss> Reading it will get you as close as one book can to actually living in nineteenth-century America, with all its follies, inequities, and promise
doomsdayer520		Jihad Vs.McWorld: Books: Benjamin R. Barber		1		This book is inexplicably influential, probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title. <sssss> Barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis, instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on Earth that he disagrees with. <sssss> Barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world, while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness. <sssss> Interestingly, Barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance, using each other's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior. <sssss> That is a fascinating thesis, which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating. <sssss> The first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists, of cultural trends that Barber disdains, in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary. <sssss> It's all tied together with attempts at "edgy" pop culture references, made-up terminology (like the annoying "infotainment telesector"), and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping. <sssss> All is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term "McWorld," which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless. <sssss> In his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses, Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior, or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days, or both. <sssss> In the second part of the book, Barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots, in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states. <sssss> His umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term "Jihad." <sssss> Note that this book was published back in 1995, so that word was not as prevalent in Western discourse as it is now, but Barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout Muslims and ardent anti-Islamists. <sssss> When it comes to the specifics, many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in Barber's arguments, and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task. <sssss> You can agree or disagree with various critiques of Barber's contentions based on your own personal politics. <sssss> But everyone will probably conclude that in this book's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis (embodied in the book's title), and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector. <sssss> Overall, this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world. <sssss> [~doomsdayer520~
Butch Carter "Big Butch"		Broken Prey (Lucas Davenport Mysteries): Books: John Sandford		2		This book was hard to put down.Can't wait for the next book
Matthew Bryde		Quest for the Gold Plates: Books: Stan Larson		2		I have spent a lot of time and money researching into Mormon history. <sssss> The big problem is that, as Henry Ford once said "History is bunk". <sssss> With Joseph Smith and the history of the Mormon church, there are hundreds of accounts that argue that he was an inspired prophet and just as many, an ingenious charlatan. <sssss> There are even accounts that avoid making a judgement either way and leave it up to the reader to decide. <sssss> Hence, using history as a basis for discovering the truth about the history of Joseph Smith can be a very frustrating (and sometimes expensive) exercise. <sssss> The Church itself avoids encouraging the study of historical events to gain testimony, but instead promotes the individual member to gain a spiritual testimony. <sssss> It is easy to see from my statement above, why. <sssss> This book takes a completely different approach in investigating the truthfulness of what Joseph Smith produced. <sssss> Forget about what might have happened in the early 1800's and instead, focus on the actual record contained in the Book of Mormon itself. <sssss> Let current day investigation be the basis for the search of truth instead of historical personal accounts. <sssss> This removes any bias of the source material and hence allows for an objective study. <sssss> Thomas Stuart Ferguson starts out as the Book of Mormon's most enthusiastic proponent. <sssss> He sacrifices a large portion of his life both petitioning the First Presidency for financial support, and performing extensive archaeological expeditions to find evidence of the civilisations documented in the Book of Mormon (BofM). <sssss> While he expects an abundance of material to be discovered, he finds none. <sssss> Nothing. <sssss> No evidence of the language or writings contained within the BofM, the animals and crops mentioned, artefacts, city names, weapons, metals, glass etc. <sssss> Nothing for the period documented within the BofM (2500 BC - 400 AD). <sssss> There are few discoveries outside this timeline, but none within. <sssss> All he wanted (and expected) to find were actual artefacts or at least murals/pictorials showing the above documented items. <sssss> The turning point came when fragments of the Joseph Smith papyri were rediscovered in the late 1960's and found to contain nothing in common with The Book of Abraham. <sssss> This is a completely separate quest in itself (see "By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus"). <sssss> While Ferguson may have lost his faith, he never left the LDS church and continued to attend and support it - he even sent a son on a mission. <sssss> He believed the Mormon church was "the best fraternity on earth". <sssss> In public, he was a "normal" member, in private circles he believed Joseph Smith was a fraud and as a result, spent the remainder of his life researching why. <sssss> This book is both a document detailing Ferguson's quest for the truth, and his way of dealing with it from the result.
Linda B.		When Madeline Was Young: A Novel: Books: Jane Hamilton		1		I have loved each and every one of Jane Hamilton's other novels and highly recommend them: The Book of Ruth, A Map of the World, Short History of a Prince and Disobedience. <sssss> This book, sadly, does not rank among them. <sssss> It feels forced and uninteresting, with outlandish and unrecognizable characters and scenarios. <sssss> I've already paid for it, so I'll probably try to finish it, but don't waste your time or money. <sssss> Read another Hamilton instead
Caligirl_08		American Beauty: An A-List Novel (A-List #7): Books: Zoey Dean		1		i wonder if im reading the same book the others are reading. <sssss> i'm on page 101 right now and it took me about 4 days to get this far. <sssss> (i've gone through 3 clique books in a day, so it's not like i'm a slow reader) the book is just so boring. <sssss> its like ive read all of this cr@p before! <sssss> so far sam had a graduation party at her dad's yacht, we hear about 2 new characters from a rival school who happen to be enemies of sam and her group and conveniently enough the two schools do something together, i forget what but it looks like it will be the opportunity for sam to get her revenge for getting poop smeared on her white jeans a few years back (eye-roll). <sssss> anna is incapable of taking care of herself at a time of crisis (her car gets rear ended by some cliche white trash woman) so her dad's 'dont judge a book by the cover cliche' tatooed but hot new intern comes to rescue her, omg romance! <sssss> (another eye roll) ben is being a troll my guess is hes cheating on her, but seriously reading that chapter where they go on this really uncomfortable date just made me want to scream at the book! <sssss> it was so annoying. <sssss> the only thing keeping me reading right now is the cammie storyline, i want her to confront her dad and find out what happened to her mom. <sssss> right now im giving the book 2 stars, after i finish the book (if i ever do) ill come back and edit this. <sssss> if anyone wants to take me out of my misery and tell me what happened to cammies mom, be my guest! <sssss> lol ***EDIT*** it got a lot better after page 101, the Sam plot got developed (a bit overdone, tacky and stalkerish, i mean a life size cut out? <sssss> a 100 cell phones? <sssss> come on, what a waste of money. <sssss> she could have donated all that $$$ to some charity in peru and impressed her guy a lot more. <sssss> the cammie story is getting juicier, and parker may have a bona fide crush on sam. <sssss> i still think ben is a creep. <sssss> well i guess i wont spoiler everything lol. <sssss> i'm still not done yet. <sssss> ill continue this after i finish. <sssss> ***FINAL EDIT*** after a good middle, the book took a nosedive. <sssss> the story of cammie's mother was horribly disappointing. <sssss> i officially HATE ben now and im getting more and more sick of anna for even being into him. <sssss> what kind of guy tries to make a girl feel weird and uptight for thinking that sex between two people should be special??? <sssss> that just really turned me off. <sssss> the girl who wins a contest by wearing nothing but body paint to the party?? <sssss> okay, this is a book that 12 year olds read, did we seriously need to hear that? <sssss> the best way to get liked is to get naked? <sssss> sigh... the two stars rating stands. <sssss> sorry
Daniel Williams "PhD, MCSD"		The Singing Life of Birds: The Art and Science of Listening to Birdsong: Books: Donald Kroodsma		2		I just got a book out of the library. <sssss> The author is a nut about recording songs and analyzing the sonograms (frequency intensity over time), and in his mind, when he hears a song, he identifies it by how it "looks" in his mental sonogram. <sssss> This whole idea is amazing, and I think I'll never listen to birds the same way again - just after reading the first few pages! <sssss> The writing style pulls you into the author's world as he tracks birds and ponders the meaning of their song. <sssss> If you love birding, you will wish you had been there on every walk, and you'll want to wake up two hours before dawn the next day to discover the amazingly different pre-dawn songs of common birds. <sssss> The book comes with as CD with 98 tracks of songs, and some of the tracks are slowed down, which really changes your perception and shows you the depth and richness of some of those "blurt" sounds birds make. <sssss> The Woodthrush at 1/10 speed reminds me of a howling wolf. <sssss> I know I'll never listed to this song the same way again
KindnessIsContagious		The Mother of All Pregnancy Books: The Ultimate Guide to Conception, Birth, and Everything In Between (U.S. Edition): Books: Ann Douglas		1		If you walk into B pppppppppp N and flip through (not even buy!) <sssss> the other "well known/recommended" pregnancy books you'll get much more information than what Douglas offers. <sssss> If you're lazy/want a quick read, this book is for you. <sssss> If you're looking for a comprehensive tell-all (which the title and reviews lead you to believe), this is *not* the book for you. <sssss> This was a total waste of money! <sssss> If I had know it was this bad I would have just used my money to buy diapers instead.
"gamergeek"		The Goomba's Book of Love: Books: Steve Schirripa,Charles Fleming		2		I really enjoyed this book. <sssss> It was a few good laughs over a few good dumps. <sssss> What else can a Goomba ask from a book sittin' on the back of the cammode
Book Club Facilitator		The History of Love: A Novel: Books: Nicole Krauss		1		Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book. <sssss> As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection. <sssss> The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader. <sssss> Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated. <sssss> I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews
Allyson Rowen Taylor "Allyson Rowen Taylor"		Orientalism: Books: Edward W Said		1		Edward Said, created a proble and made a career of the Israel Palestine Conflict, and conviently died before he could also resolve the death and destruction he brought to the Arab Palestinians. <sssss> He was a one man destruction derby under the guise of poetry, linguistics and hate and he helped stir up anti Israel and anti Jewish hatred on every University he spoke at. <sssss> Hopefully, this "vintage" book will become no longer relevant, ans disappear
		Venison Cookery (The Complete Hunter): Books: Creative Publishing international		2		The quality of this presentation is far above what one normally sees in pppppppppp quot;game pppppppppp quot; cookbooks. <sssss> Lots of color pictures; all recipes tried so far are keepers. <sssss> BTW: elk substitutes straight across in most of the recipes so its like two books in one
Robin Cobin		MCSA/MCSE: Windows Server 2003 Environment Management and Maintenance Study Guide (70-290): Books: Lisa Donald,Suzan Sage London,James Chellis,Lisa Donald,James Chellis		1		I agree with one of the earlier reviewers headlines, that was something like pppppppppp quot;just ok, not great. <sssss> pppppppppp quot; I've been working w/ Server 2003 for a while now, and from my work experience, I knew certain things in the book were kind of being glossed over that really needed more coverage. <sssss> I would read each chapter, read the summaries, take all the practice questions, and be left with this nagging feeling that the book was not really preparing me completely for what I'd face on the exam. <sssss> Unfortunately, I was right, and I just missed passing the exam. <sssss> This book isn't terrible, but just be sure you use some additional resources and that you have some good work experience also
Enigma		The Book of Mormon: Books: Joseph Smith,Rick Grunder		2		This item is a must-have for anyone who is serious about understanding the origins of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS or Mormons for short). <sssss> While not an authentic artifact, it is an excellent reproduction of the original book that started one of America's most successful and controversial social-religious movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. <sssss> This reproduction allows the reader to read the original 19th century language style of structure and grammar as it fell from the lips of Joseph Smith (Author and Proprietor) to the pen(s) of his various scribes. <sssss> When the book is placed in it's historical context, the reader can see the doctrinal development of many of the key points of theology that are the underpinning of the current LDS Church as well as Smith's answers for many of the religious concerns of his day. <sssss> Also, interestingly, when compared to the current version of the book and the LDS Church today, the reader can see the evolution of church doctrine over time. <sssss> For Example: The development from a monotheistic doctrine of deity (see book of 1 Nephi and Mosiah - also see Lectures on Faith, also by Smith), to the current polytheistic doctrine that the church espouses (see current version of the Book of Mormon - changing of the text in 1 Nephi to correspond with current church doctrine). <sssss> The original condemnation of polygamy (marriage to more than one wife at a time) with the exception of raising up a righteous posterity (see book of Jacob), to the open endorsement and practice of the same from the mid to late 19th century for no reason other than Smith saying that God commanded the practice, then to the abandonment of the practice in order to prevent Church property from being confiscated and to allow Utah statehood in the union. <sssss> The condemnation of secret, oath-bound clandestine societies (see book of Helaman, 3 Nephi, Ether) to the practice of blood oaths of secrecy, loyalty and revenge (for the murder of Smith) in the Masonic-derived Nauvoo temple endowment. <sssss> The original condemnation and futility of Baptism for children and those that die without the law (see book of Mormon - name of a section within the book), to the practice of performing all church ordinances (including baptism) vicariously for the dead (those that died without the law). <sssss> Like all religious/social/mass movements, the LDS Church will evolve and change to meet the needs of its members. <sssss> The importance of this book for any follower of the religion (or student of sociology, history, etc.) <sssss> is to chart the origins of the institution and then follow it's metamorphosis over time as the institution attempts to adapt to a constantly changing and growing market. <sssss> For that reason alone the book receives 5 stars.
B. Schroeder		Are You My Mother? (Bright pppppppppp Early Board Books(TM)): Books: P.D. Eastman		2		Three of my nephews and my son's favorite book. <sssss> He wore it out and I had to buy another one.
Kimberly Wolfinger "Twighlight"		Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Book 4): Books: J. K. Rowling,Mary GrandPr?		1		I was more upset with this book than anyother. <sssss> I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing. <sssss> I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. <sssss> But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. <sssss> Still, i am addicted to the series . <sssss> Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. <sssss> I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable
B. Lovian "blovian"		Conquer the Crash: You Can Survive and Prosper in a Deflationary Depression, Expanded and Updated Edition: Books: Robert R. Prechter		1		This book contains some useful historical information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms, bubbles, and busts. <sssss> Prechter should have left it at that. <sssss> Instead, he offers up predictions. <sssss> Big mistake. <sssss> This guy bases his forecasts on Fibonacci numbers and so-called Elliott "wave counts." <sssss> He labels all market patterns so that they fit the preordained Elliott Wave 5-up, 3-down pattern. <sssss> If you see more or fewer waves than he does in any given market move, you just don't understand that there can only be 5 waves to the top of a bull market. <sssss> He's imposing his theory on the market, but surprisingly enough, the market doesn't care. <sssss> It does whatever it wants, in however many waves it wants, and Bob has been very frustrated at the market's aberrant behavior lately. <sssss> He got lucky early in his career, but it seems he's been fairly consistently getting the market wrong since missing the '87 crash. <sssss> Any superstitution can "seem" to work if you only look at its happenstance apparent accuracies and disregard its abundant failures. <sssss> Keep looking for certain numbers of waves and Fibonacci ratios and you'll find what you're looking for. <sssss> Pick any set of numbers or patterns or wave counts, and you'll find those too. <sssss> The market doesn't care about any of those things, though. <sssss> It's nothing more than an aggregation of billlions of individual choices, which are influenced by an infinite number of factors none of us can ever understand fully. <sssss> University studies of various investing methods have found that Elliott Wave, like most, is no better than random stock selection. <sssss> If Prechter had chosen the random method, he and his followers would at least have a good chance of keeping pace with the market. <sssss> Unfortunately, he has been getting everything from the Dow, to oil (he thought it was going to $10), to gold (he didn't think it could break $400), to deflation (the "deflation" scare ended shortly after this book came out) WRONG in the past couple of years. <sssss> He apparently STILL believes that the Dow will go to 400 (not 4,000 but FOUR HUNDRED) because his charts tell him it should (they've been telling him that since about 1990, actually). <sssss> Prechter doesn't understand demographics or economics or markets or the monetary system, all of which render "Dow 400" among the goofiest of forecasting absurdities -- unless you believe a giant asteroid will hit and wipe out two thirds of the population (I don't think Prechter is counting on that). <sssss> Our debt-heavy economy may have a significant crisis soon, perhaps by the end of the decade. <sssss> It will most likely be spurred on by inflation and rising interest rates. <sssss> But it's not happening now and it's not happening in the way this author has been prematurely forecasting for over a decade. <sssss> This book came out near the bottom of the 2000-2002 stock bear market, just in time for a reader to short stocks as they began a new bull market. <sssss> How typical. <sssss> While promoting the book, Prechter said it was "definite" that stocks would "crash" in 2003. <sssss> He said that 2003 would be "the best year yet" for bears (short sellers). <sssss> Late into 2003, when it was clear that the market had proven him wrong, Prechter declared on a radio show that by the end of 2004, the Dow would "certainly" fall below 5,000. <sssss> Wrong again! <sssss> Since his Fibonacci turn dates and Elliott wave counts fail to portend the future, maybe next he'll tell us he's found the secret code to the stock market from the text count of Nostradamus' writings. <sssss> Bob Prechter couldn't call the market if it was listed in the Yellow Pages. <sssss> This guy couldn't time the market if you gave him a stopwatch. <sssss> He's throwing out guesses and misleading people by describing them as "definite" and "certain." <sssss> He's either a liar or a true believer in his own irrational superstitions. <sssss> In either case, he's not credible. <sssss> Here's all you really need to know: Buy dividend stocks. <sssss> Buy short-term bonds. <sssss> Buy gold. <sssss> Hang on to them. <sssss> Do that and you'll do better than you will trying to follow the prognostications of market gurus. <sssss> Plus, you'll have a lot more time to devote to family, fun, and productive activities
Stratiotes Doxha Theon "Stratiotes"		The Histories (Oxford World's Classics): Books: Tacitus,D. S. Levene,W. H. Fyfe		2		Every now and then a pivotal moment in history is witnessed and recorded by a master communicator. <sssss> The mid-first century of Rome was such a time and Tacitus was such a communicator. <sssss> The Histories will forever be a benchmark of good history with its observations on human nature and behaviour along with their impact on history. <sssss> The historian will do well to read Tacitus not just for the historical lessons but for his approach to history as a record of human activity. <sssss> While observing and commenting on the human element in history, Tacitus avoids making moral judgements and remains as objective as possible in the midst of turmoil, wars, and rumors of wars. <sssss> His beloved nation and people were suffering under the barbarity of fratricidal war yet he remains above the madness and records the events with passion tempered with objectivity. <sssss> His example is one that has remained difficult for others to follow. <sssss> A word on this translation in particular - I found Mr. Wellesley's translation very readable and poetic. <sssss> He seems to have captured the literature value of the text as well as the content. <sssss> Well done
Amy Gustine		Sophie's choice: Books: William Styron		1		This is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction. <sssss> Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius. <sssss> Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz. <sssss> Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber. <sssss> While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to. <sssss> Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable. <sssss> The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit. <sssss> The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half. <sssss> And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie. <sssss> In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind: why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan? <sssss> A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl? <sssss> A blind panic? <sssss> A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose? <sssss> It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative. <sssss> In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it. <sssss> Really? <sssss> Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations. <sssss> She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates. <sssss> Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex? <sssss> How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me. <sssss> The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures
American Idiot "K.T."		Royally Jacked (Simon Romantic Comedies): Books: Niki Burnham		2		This book is a story about a girl named Valerie. <sssss> Her life is turned in the direction of weird when her mom anouccnces that she wants a divorce because she has found a new love. <sssss> With another woman!! <sssss> With this scary detail in mind Valerie's dad has been called on business to a small unknow country in Europe to be a royal chef. <sssss> One good thing does happen to her though. <sssss> When in the library trying to figure out her new school test she mets the Prince. <sssss> Prince Greog. <sssss> To find out more read Royally Jacked. <sssss> And remember even if the begining is boring keep going cuz the book does get better and continues to do so. <sssss> So enjoy:
snowyafternoon "snowy"		Skeleton Coast: A Novel of the Oregon Files: Books: Clive Cussler,Jack Du Brul		1		While I enjoy adventure stories for the casual reading they are and have read all of Cussler's, I was disturbed by a lot of the assumptions in this and other of his recent books. <sssss> This is transparently hawkish; an ultra-conservative defense of the questionable actions of the very furthest right of the political spectrum. <sssss> (One could even suspect it was commissioned or at least underwritten by these elements.) <sssss> It reflects the current culture that decrees all means justify the end - as long it benefits the right people. <sssss> Cussler's recent books portray that it's OKAY for Americans to go into other countries - with which we are not at war - and kill its citizens for some secret government agenda. <sssss> That it's OKAY for our US government to hire out "black ops" in secret because it's against our laws to do so openly. <sssss> Through the years, I've tolerated Cussler's blatant sexism, juvenile writing style, improbable exploits of cartoonish heroes. <sssss> However, he has veered into political territory that offends me but even more, terrifies me that it may be the truest part of his stories
James Rockefeller		Longitudes and Attitudes: The World in the Age of Terrorism: Books: Thomas L. Friedman		2		Tom Friedman is a engaging writer. <sssss> He also writes from a very personal perspective, both as to how the world has changed for him and his family, and for his friends around the world. <sssss> You get the feeling that Mr. Friedman is describing the world changing as he is watching. <sssss> What a treat and a very easy read. <sssss> Pick it up and learn about what is really going on outside the US shores
Avid Reader		Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America): Books: Thomas Paine,Eric Foner		1		On the one hand, I loved the book, since I am a big fan of Thomas Paine. <sssss> However, my particular copy was missing the last 50 pages or so of "The Age of Reason". <sssss> When they get the printing and/or binding problems straightend out and have purged the inventory of the defective books, they should remove this review. <sssss> At that point, I will eagerly buy a new copy
Robert Penn		Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel--Why Everything You Know is Wrong: Books: John Stossel		1		Lies, half truths, spin and glitz. <sssss> Of course there is some truth sprinkled in. <sssss> Self promoting TV stars are more interested in being self promoting TV stars than truth. <sssss> Theres just not enough time for both. <sssss> At best it's entertainment, at worst it misleads the children. <sssss> And finally they are all biblically illiterate. <sssss> So be careful...especially with TBN.
B. Mraz "Raiderbern"		Jim Otto: The PAIN OF GLORY: Books: Jim Otto		2		A very straight forward book by Jim Otto. <sssss> There is a price when one wants to achieve or aspire to achieve glory on the gridiron. <sssss> Jim Otto is that person and he candidly tells us what he was willing to sacrifice to reach that plateau. <sssss> For the Raider fan at heart, or a football fan in general, this is the book to read
Kelley E. Stover "Drew"		The Devil's Arithmetic: Books: Jane Yolen		1		Have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on? <sssss> For me, that was this book. <sssss> If you like fantasy then you might like this, because that is the genre of this book. <sssss> It is about a Jewish girl named Hannah. <sssss> She goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door. <sssss> She opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream. <sssss> She now has a new name, Chaya. <sssss> She now has to figure out what happened, and what she will do in this body. <sssss> It takes place in New Rochelle. <sssss> It is old times. <sssss> It doesn't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting. <sssss> She doesn't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it. <sssss> I didn't like this book at all. <sssss> I thought it was really hard to follow. <sssss> You have to pay attention throughout the whole book. <sssss> You can never daydream or you won't know why they are calling her a new name. <sssss> This was definitely made for older adults, or people with a higher reading level. <sssss> If you are a good reader and you like to challenge yourself, try this book. <sssss> I don't recommend this book if you are younger, or just not that well of a reader. <sssss> This is for very and I mean very good and high level readers. <sssss> I would say between the ages of 25-60 might like this book. <sssss> I don't think this book was a page turner. <sssss> I wanted to put it down, instead of not wanting to put it down. <sssss> It never sparked my interest. <sssss> Her being Jewish, and the book being a fantasy, I couldn't relate to anything that happened. <sssss> This book was hard to concentrate on. <sssss> If you look up for one second, you miss most of the story, so concentrate hard. <sssss> I couldn't relate to anyone. <sssss> I am not Jewish. <sssss> If you are Jewish, you might actually understand this book better than I could. <sssss> I didn't like the genre. <sssss> It was all fake and totally unrealistic. <sssss> If you like that sort of stuff, then read this book, but I don't like fantasy. <sssss> I didn't like how it was written. <sssss> It was too hard to concentrate on. <sssss> I had to reread twice to find out why they are calling her a different name. <sssss> I never found any surprised in the story. <sssss> I could guess what would happen next. <sssss> It was predictable. <sssss> None of the chapters had cliffhangers. <sssss> If just was boring and that's it. <sssss> I thought it was extremely boring. <sssss> I didn't understand anything and I would rather do my homework, than read that book. <sssss> My mind wandered a lot. <sssss> I had to read sections over and over again. <sssss> I never believed the plot one bit. <sssss> With the story being fantasy, everything is farfetched. <sssss> I think older people would enjoy this book, because they would be the only ones who could understand it.
Michael North		Congo: Books: Michael Crichton,Rolando Costa Picazo		2		This was the book that got me to enjoy reading back in the day. <sssss> This was also my first Crichton, and I have to say I enjoyed it to the fullest. <sssss> Easy to read adventure novel
Phyllis Swain		The Beach House (John, Sally): Books: Sally John		2		I absolutely loved this book! <sssss> I could relate to each of the four women at different times in their lives. <sssss> It reminded me to take all things to HIM in prayer at ALL times
R. Hanak		Survivor in Death (In Death): Books: J.D. Robb,Susan Ericksen		1		the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book. <sssss> the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. <sssss> what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were. <sssss> this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. <sssss> dont waste your time reading it
Laurie C. Kellogg "Flounder"		How To Raise A Gentleman A Civilized Guide To Helping Your Son Through His Uncivilized Childhood: Books: Kay West		1		My 60s something father gave me this book. <sssss> I am a 45-year-old middle-class man with a 6-year-old son using my wife's account. <sssss> I don't understand for whom this book is written. <sssss> It is full of painfully obvious advice such as "Don't play with your food" or "Do not throw golf clubs... in anger." <sssss> Anyone raised in America (presuming that is the author's intended audience) who doesn't already understand these things and take them to heart isn't going to be interested in reading about them in a book, if they can even read. <sssss> Chapter 15 deals with Staring and differences where the author admonishes: "Do not repeat racist, sexist or ethnic jokes or tolerate them in your presence." <sssss> If you were not a racist you would obviously already understand and agree with this. <sssss> If you are, this book isn't going to change your attitude and you would probably want to burn it. <sssss> I found this book useless for any reasonably sophisticated person unless you happen to be from a third world country or another planet. <sssss> If the book was intended to teach good manners to the unsophisticated, dream on! <sssss> I think the author has a Professor Henry Higgins Jones. <sssss> I am also concerned about my father's opinion of me, I mean "Do not expect a child to endure a lengthy shopping trip unless it is to a toy or candy store." <sssss> Duh
Cathy "Cathy"		Dogs for Dummies: Books: Gina Spadafori,Marty Becker		1		This book is so full of misinformation that I shudder to think (since it is in the pppppppppp quot;dummies pppppppppp quot; series), that this may be the only information that many people will read before they embark upon a very serious commitment with a dog. <sssss> It is poorly researched, full of dogma and nonsense. <sssss> If you have to read a pppppppppp quot;quick book pppppppppp quot; find one written by an expert - a veterinarian, or anyone with a track record in animals. <sssss> Instant info can be found on bulletin discussion boards, magazines etc
dr_rizz		Lost in the Funhouse (The Anchor Literary Library): Books: John Barth		2		Lost in the Funhouse can be a very bewildering and irritating collection if you aren't in the right mood for it. <sssss> If you aren't well-versed in post-modern fiction (barthelme, calvino, etc are good reference points) you might want to start somewhere else first. <sssss> Even Barth's novels are more immediately digestible. <sssss> With that said, though, this collection doesn't really operate on one consistent level. <sssss> Perhaps this is because many of these stories were written by Barth much earlier in his career. <sssss> The three stories concerning Ambrose's birth and development are very straightforward and enjoyable on a surface level until the whole series goes flying into left-field with the titular "Lost in the Funhouse" story (which Barth is probably most known for). <sssss> From that point on, most of the stories are more about the process of writing and the relationship between the reader, writer, and the characters. <sssss> Stories like "Title" and "Life-Story" work more as essays on the nature of fiction than actual works of fiction, and were (for me at least) a little tedious. <sssss> The best moments occur when Barth combines his thoughful analysis on the nature of writing and art with a really good ground-situation, typically based on Greek mythology. <sssss> The best of these are the utterly raunchy "Petitition" and the labyrinthine "Menelaiad". <sssss> Taken as a whole, though, Lost in the Funhouse is greatly satisfying, even if (like me) you really only understood about 20% of what Barth was talking about on your first read-through. <sssss> It's the sort of book I'll go back to again and again to try and delve deeper into the mystery of the funhouse while appreciating all over the hilarious bawdy humor. <sssss> Oh, and make sure to read Barth's seven additional notes at the front of the book (though maybe only after you've read the story that is being discussed in each note, so as not to ruin the initial experience)-- they really help to clarify some of Barth's intentions. <sssss> I can't even imagine appreciating a story like "Glossolalia" without having read the note concerning it
K. Gray "kennypop702"		The Pelican Brief: Books: John Grisham		2		The Pelican Brief is one of John Grisham's more fast paced and exciting book. <sssss> Two supreme court justices are murdered by someone who does such a good job that there are few if any clues to go on. <sssss> Darby Shaw and her lover/professor are intrigued by who could have done this so Darby does a ton of research and writes the "Pelican Brief". <sssss> Her boyfriend/professor is a good friend of someone in the FBI and the file gets distributed. <sssss> The bad guys find out about Darby, who apparently has hit the suspects right on and the chase begins. <sssss> This book is very entertaining with nonstop action. <sssss> You'll be constantly turning the page to see how Darby and friends etc keep escaping and how the plot will unfold. <sssss> The only problems with the book are as follows: 1 - The book has so many characters that it gets confusing at times 2 - The book is all action and adventure and little else. <sssss> Once it's done you'll never go back and read it again. <sssss> This would make a very poor book club book. <sssss> 3 - A little over the top on the implied sex etc between Darby and her professor etc... (but nothing compared to what you'll get in other books) Overall a very entertaing and exciting book but not a lot of "soul". <sssss> I would definitely recomend it to anyone who likes action books.
Edward Bosnar		Nationalism (Oxford Readers): Books: John Hutchinson,Anthony Smith		2		This is a reader that covers the various theories of nationalism as well as varieties of nationalism itself. <sssss> This makes it a largely indispensable supplement, handbook and reference work for anyone interested in nationalism. <sssss> This is particularly true today as the scholarship on this social phenomenon continues to grow unabated, and since it is patently obvious that nationalism hardly seems about to disappear. <sssss> The reader contains important extracts from the major works on nationalism by some of the most important early theorists such as Renan, Max Weber and Stalin (although the views of Marx and Engels themselves or Lord Acton and Friedrich Meinecke would have been welcome additions) and almost all of the most important contemporary scholars (Gellner, Anderson, Connor, A. Smith, etc.). <sssss> The texts are well-selected and organized, and it really contributes to making a very complex subject and a daunting field of scholarship seem a little easier to grasp
Whatever		The Opal Deception (Artemis Fowl, Book 4): Books: Eoin Colfer,Nathaniel Parker		1		I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good. <sssss> Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace
Michael C. Mercado		K Is for Killer (Kinsey Millhone Mysteries (Paperback)): Books: Sue Grafton		1		Well, if anything this was a decently written story, with good dialect and character detail. <sssss> However, this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending. <sssss> Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there. <sssss> The story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door. <sssss> She opens it to find Janice Kepler, mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter's mysterious death. <sssss> Not only this, but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house. <sssss> They talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after Lorna's death. <sssss> This tape leads Kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer. <sssss> Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive, elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount. <sssss> Kinsey also checks up on Lorna's family members, and with the exception of Janice, all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna. <sssss> Not being a fan of these types of novels, I decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere. <sssss> By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story, but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended. <sssss> I stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too. <sssss> The ending left me with a strange feeling and I didn't know if the book had actually ended. <sssss> All in all, it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you're a murder mystery fan, try any other of Grafton's alphabet themed novels besides this one
L. McKenna		Raising Adopted Children, Revised Edition: Practical Reassuring Advice for Every Adoptive Parent: Books: Lois Ruskai Melina		1		Like the other posters, I too was given this book as part of our homestudy for adopting a child from China. <sssss> After reading the first chapter I found myself insulted. <sssss> This book assumes all who read it are adopting because they cannot get pregnant, which is not my case. <sssss> While infertility is something that should not be ignored, and I appreciate the fact that most adoption books I read address the matter, this book would have been much more respectable if it did not direct its text to the reader as a person who cannot conceive. <sssss> I was so insulted that I returned the book to my social worker with these concerns
A. Rowley		Heartbreaker: Books: Julie Garwood		2		This was my first Julie Garwood novel and it was very good. <sssss> I thoroughly enjoyed this authors descriptive characterization. <sssss> The playful bantering had me laughing uncontrollably and falling in love with the characters even more with every page I read. <sssss> With all the other reviews, I don't need to explain the plot. <sssss> It isn't anything new for the romantic suspense genre, but very entertaining and an enjoyable read. <sssss> It has mystery, intrigue, suspense, action, and romance. <sssss> What more can a reader want? <sssss> Is it worth the money? <sssss> Definitely. <sssss> Can't wait to read more.
JMack		When all you've ever wanted isn't enough: Books: Harold S Kushner		2		I too have stood at the dessert table of a buffet hopelessly unable to eat as many servings as I wanted. <sssss> This is a perfect metaphor for the book "When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough". <sssss> The book is about the spiritual yearning you feel inside, that always seems to want something more. <sssss> Until they arrive at that "something more", people can never truly feel content. <sssss> As is the case with most of Kushner's writing, he uses a book of the old testament to further his explanation. <sssss> In this case, he effectively employs the seemingly paradoxical book of Ecclesiastes. <sssss> This book of the Bible finds its author searching for more in life. <sssss> In the end, the author finds that it is not so much the end as the journey itself that has importance. <sssss> Kushner's overall point is best summarized on page 189. <sssss> Does it make a difference if I am honest, good, or faithful? <sssss> It does not seem to matter to my bank account or fortune. <sssss> "... <sssss> It matters if we are true to ourselves, to our innate human nature that requires things like honesty and kindness and grows flabby and distorted if we neglect them. <sssss> It matters if we learn how to share our lives with others, making them and their world different, rather than try and hoard life to ourselves. <sssss> It matters than we learn to recognize the pleasures of every day, food and work and love and friendship, as encounters with the divine, encounters that teach us not only that God is real but that we are real too." <sssss> It is a simple yet beautiful message. <sssss> People that live this message will certainly discover the beauty in their life
CW		John's Vegan Vegetarian Cookbook: A 90-day Meal and Excercise Plan: Books: John Price		1		I was really disappointed with this book. <sssss> A lot of the recipes are identical to one another, with just one ingredient - eg a different type of vegetable - substituted. <sssss> With no pictures and not much more content, I really regret buying it.
teva_man "teva_man"		The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book: Books: Vince Waldron		2		This is *da book* on pppppppppp quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show pppppppppp quot;, but it's really far more than that. <sssss> It is the finest book on a TV sitcom I've ever come across. <sssss> Waldron painstakingly discusses everything you'd ever want to know about the show, and he interviewed (seemingly) everyone connected with the show, including Carl Reiner, Mary Tyler Moore, Dick, Larry Matthews, Rose Marie, and many of the writers. <sssss> If you're a DVDS fan, you've gottta have this tome on hand. <sssss> I can't recommend it highly enough. <sssss> I fervently hope Vince will do subsequent books on pppppppppp quot;Cheers pppppppppp quot; and other sitcoms...he's the ONLY man for the job
Alan D. Abbey		Journey of Hope: The Story of Ilan Ramon, Israel's First Astronaut: Books: Alan D. Abbey		2		I want everyone to know that this book was a labor of love. <sssss> I want to help make people aware of the life and the legacy of Ilan Ramon, a hero and inspiring figure for all of us
Norman Snyder		Life Is Short, Wear Your Party Pants: Books: Loretta LaRoche		1		The cover of this book declares that you'll learn "Ten Simple Truths That Lead To an Amazing Life." <sssss> If your idea of an amazing life can be distilled to "eat, drink, and be merry," then perhaps you'll see value in the sophomoric platitudes that abound in this book. <sssss> Alfred E. Neuman, of Mad Magazine, with his declaration of "What, me? <sssss> Worry?" <sssss> provides a pithier statement of the philosophy proposed by Ms. LaRoche. <sssss> If you're looking for some deeper meaning to life, to success, to accomplishment, you'd be much better served by reading Napoleon Hill, Anthony Robbins, Dr. <sssss> Covey, Denis Waitley, or Brian Tracey.
F. Wessel "desertgirl"		Inflation: The ultimate graven image: Books: James Jay Ferris		2		Awesome. <sssss> This book is worth its weight in gold for the insights and understanding it shares. <sssss> With a professional background in finance, economics and a profound study of the Word of God, the author is well qualified to expose mammon for what it is, and to challenge the reader to a deeper surrender to the only real treasure worth having. <sssss> Buy two and give a copy away. <sssss> Can we have a new edition please
Michael E Brady "mandmbrady"		Moneyball: Books: Michael Lewis		2		Lewis has written a fascinating study of the bean counter approach ,used by Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics to construct a team of moderately priced players chosen on the basis of ,primarily, on base percentage for everyday players and the number of groundball outs and strikeouts for selecting pitchers. <sssss> This approach generated a number of divisional championships for Oakland in the weakest American League division,but no pennants and world championships.There are omitted variables and misspecification problems in the sabermetrics(statistics) approach of Bill James used by Beane.First,James's system totally ignores the number of batter strikeouts.All outs are not equal.Hitting flyouts and groundball outs will many times advance the baserunner if any previous batters got on base.Hitting the ball also allows the baserunner to get on on an error.Strikeouts are thus the worst type of out.This omitted variables problem can be dealt with by simply deducting 1 to 1.25 points from the on base percentage for every strikeout over,say,100 for a regular,everyday player who gets 600 official at bats over the course of the season.The second problem is that the James system does not differentiate between walks due to the hitting skill of the batter and walks used by the pitcher to set up forceplays and double plays,especially if he is a pitcher who gets a lot of ground ball outs.Another category is needed-walks that are not followed by forceouts or double play groundouts and/or walks where the runner is able to steal second base.These walks are different from the walks given to a 40 homer player who strikes out 150+ times a year and hits .250 but has a .375 OBP. <sssss> James's system needs to be adjusted to take into account these two factors
Lynne M. Doyle		On Death and Dying (Hudson River editions): Books: Kubler		2		I haven't had a chance to read the book in its entirity, but have enjoyed what I have read.
M. Drew "minnesota-export"		Chocolate Obsession: Confections and Treats to Create and Savor: Books: Michael Recchiuti,Fran Gage,Maren Caruso		2		This is not the book for you if you're impatient with precision and specifics; if you want good results, you'll do what Michael Recchiuti tells you to do. <sssss> You'll buy the higher-butterfat butter, you'll use the Scharffen-Berger or Valrhona and chuck the Hershey's, and you'll be so glad you did, because every recipe --and I mean every single one of the seven or eight recipes I have tried from this book thus far-- has been fantastic. <sssss> I would not call this a good beginner's cookbook, though the photography is gorgeous enough to qualify this as a coffee table book even for those who don't want to get in the kitchen. <sssss> Some baking experience is helpful, as is a well-equipped kitchen (stand-mixer, immersion blender, heavy-bottomed pots for sauces etc). <sssss> This is an outstanding book and I highly recommend it.
Mark Fitzsimmons		The Liars' Club: Books: Mary Karr		2		How does she do it? <sssss> This will forever be one of my favorite books. <sssss> Reading about the astoundingly crazy life Mary Karr had as a child made me wonder how her sense of humor could be so sharp and perfect and still get across the sadness and pathos without making me feel bad or hopeless. <sssss> Nor did I feel that she was in a hopeless situation. <sssss> It always seemed as though there were morsels of goodness somewhere to be found. <sssss> A profoundly inspiring book. <sssss> I only hope I can be as resourceful and resilient
C. Gilbert "frumiousb"		Flashback: Books: Nevada Barr		1		This is the second Nevada Barr that I have read. <sssss> I picked it up on the strength of Deep South, which I thought was really terrific. <sssss> It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback. <sssss> Flashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to Anna Pigeon's own family. <sssss> The civil war story (told through letters and dream-like sequences) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story. <sssss> Some may like the flavor that this element provides, but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy. <sssss> I really liked the crisp realism of Deep South, and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre. <sssss> Flashback, on the other hand, felt painfully contrived. <sssss> The plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and (to my mind) unnecessary. <sssss> If you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel, then you will probably be significantly less bothered than I was by Flashback. <sssss> Barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book. <sssss> Judging from the reviews, not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines. <sssss> I will go ahead and pick up a third Barr book, because I did like Deep South so much. <sssss> It was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing, but hope that it can be redeemed with a third.
Robert Goehring "Spreading my Heat All Over"		In Dubious Battle (20th Century Classics): Books: John Steinbeck,Warren French		1		I'm perhaps the only Steinbeck lover not to have yet read "Grapes of Wrath" or "East of Eden." <sssss> Instead I have focused on "Of Mice and Men" and his lesser known works, such as "To a God Unknown" and, my personal favorite, "Pastures of Heaven." <sssss> I've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular. <sssss> When I began reading "In Dubious Battle," it appeared the most engaging of all Steinbeck's work. <sssss> Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac, it begins with the story of hardscrabble Jim initiating himself into Mac's radical cell. <sssss> There is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar, work secretly through letters, go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers. <sssss> Early on, the pace is fast, exciting, and engaging. <sssss> Suddenly, Steinbeck simply fails to deliver, leaving the reader wondering when he's going to pick up the pace again. <sssss> After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a worker's strike, I expected the sense of excitement to continue. <sssss> It simply never does. <sssss> Summary of "In Dubious Battle" - Workers get mad. <sssss> Workers get tired. <sssss> Workers get mad. <sssss> Workers get tired. <sssss> Workers get mad. <sssss> Workers get tired. <sssss> The rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking. <sssss> And while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first, they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book. <sssss> Most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration, and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense... ...and eating. <sssss> Steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story, because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding, eating, and (worst of all) TALKING about food. <sssss> There is plenty of action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story, but for some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment, discussing whatever comes to mind. <sssss> Steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters. <sssss> But I advise any reader of "In Dubious Battle" to take this course - after the strike is initiated, simply set the book down. <sssss> You won't miss anything. <sssss> Nothing of great import happens, and only a very few memorable characters ever surface, and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces. <sssss> I suppose now I'll give "Grapes of Wrath" a go. <sssss> Perhaps if it isn't one of his "greats," it isn't worth reading
Jantasy "Diverse tastes"		Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth: Book 2: Books: Peter Kelder		2		For those who have not read Volume 1, just get Book 2 and get all the great information plus lots more. <sssss> Being a born-again Christian, some of the dialogue is beyond my belief system, but just glean the book and keep the great stuff. <sssss> If your faith is well-grounded, just look at this as a first class medical journal and forget the buddhist hogwash
C. A. Lemley "Cal"		Principle Centered Leadership: Books: Stephen R. Covey		2		Period
Ned Roberts "hrned"		How America Lost Iraq: Books: Aaron Glantz		2		Glantz punctures both left and right in this balanced analysis of what has gone wrong in Iraq. <sssss> A powerful story that should be required reading for politicians and political groupies of all leanings
Strogie "rochstar"		Tribulation Force (Left Behind, Book 2): Books: Jerry B. Jenkins,Tim F. LaHaye		1		As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. <sssss> Way flat. <sssss> There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book. <sssss> I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point. <sssss> Overall, very disappointing.
Michael Schein "gentleman and scholar"		A Tale of Two Cities: Books: Charles Dickens		1		Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. <sssss> That is my experience with this book. <sssss> For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. <sssss> So I picked it up. <sssss> What a slog! <sssss> A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. <sssss> We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. <sssss> The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. <sssss> An admittedly cool concept. <sssss> Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears.
Jackson "Jackson from BX"		The Computer Animator's Technical Handbook (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Graphics): Books: Lynn Pocock,Judson Rosebush		1		The book is basically a dictionary of terms in the computer graphic field. <sssss> All most the whole book contain very simple ideas and concept I knew already. <sssss> Also Lynn Pocock doesn't even do computer graphic work professionally. <sssss> I have yet to see any computer animation works by the writer. <sssss> SAVE YOUR MONEY
James M. Barrett		The Color of Oil : The History, the Money and the Politics of the World's Biggest Business: Books: Michael Economides,Ronald Oligney		1		Much of this book is very one sided. <sssss> In particular the sections on the environment are distorted and now known to be incorrect. <sssss> The book would be much better if they had not shown their bias
Tiana D		PREPAREDNESS NOW!: An Emergency Survival Guide for Civilians and Their Families: Books: Aton Edwards		2		I have a pile of thes books at home pppppppppp this is the first one that ever gave me any useful information. <sssss> I am physically challenged and I have a hard time getting around. <sssss> This is the only book I ever read that features information for people like me
Sean Grady		Dude, Where's My Country?: Books: Michael Moore		1		In a review remarkable for saying nothing about the book, Popop from Boston (April 9 below) alludes to some children blown up by an IRA bomb in a North of England shopping center. <sssss> Popop is very broad-minded. <sssss> It pains him that anyone would bad-mouth such "armed operations". <sssss> They were perfectly justified, he explains, because of thousands of innocent Irish Catholics murdered at the hands of the British army. <sssss> I know why thousands of murders are important to Popop. <sssss> Without them, while he might justify random bombings in his own mind, he could hardly do so in decent company. <sssss> But I live in Ireland, not America, where news of these murdered thousands has not reached us. <sssss> Gerry Adams never said a word about them, not wishing to be laughed out of the country. <sssss> He had to make the most all these years of a dozen fellows caught in a crossfire in Derry in 1973. <sssss> I guess he saved the big one for the broad-minded boyos in Boston. <sssss> What of all those dollars that Popop broad-mindedly dropped in the Semtex collection box? <sssss> They were not wasted. <sssss> Thousands of Irish really were murdered - mostly not Catholics but all of them really dead - at the hands of the disorganization that Mr Adams always denied being a member of. <sssss> To be sure, his non-henchmen failed to terrorize the Northern Irish into caving in, but his enforcer, who can barely write his own name, did get to be Minister of Education (I'm not making this up; I couldn't). <sssss> Oh, and the book is quite thought-provoking. <sssss> There's a lot about Bushes, Arabs and the wrong kind of tax-cuts that went over my head. <sssss> There's wit of a subtlety rarely seen since Voltaire - you can tell by the CAPITALS and !!!!. <sssss> There are explanations of 9/11 to suit every taste, whichever Bush you blame. <sssss> Myself, I suspect those Enrons. <sssss> But Mr Moore did discover: "THERE ... IS ... NO ... <sssss> TERRORIST ... <sssss> THREAT!" <sssss> He paid us a flying visit, dined with some IRA capos who were laughing up their sleeves, and found the solution to the Irish Question without breaking sweat: everybody should be nice to each other
R. Pitlak "sports-bet-advantage.com"		The Best of Thoroughbred Handicapping: Leading Ideas pppppppppp Methods: Books: James Quinn		2		This book is an almost encylocpedic digest of current theories of thoroughbred handicapping. <sssss> None are covered in such detail that you can run off and start making money at the track, but each points you to a source for more comprehensive information on the theory that interests you. <sssss> If you are willing to ignore books on "handicapping made easy," this book is probably among the best starting points for the novice. <sssss> It explores a variety of approaches, leaving you to select what you like, and follow a path toward mastery
michael.b.lee@vanderbilt.edu		Bloodstone (Jon Shannow Adventure): Books: David Gemmell		2		Just when you think you've got Gemmell figured out, he turns the tables on you. <sssss> Fans of Gemmell and Jon Shannow might find the book a bit slow at first, and something of a retread of previous Jerusalem Man tales, but be patient...the master has got some great surprises up his sleeve! <sssss> Readers unfamiliar with Shannow are strongly advised to go back and read the previous Stones of Power books before this one. <sssss> You won't be disappointed. <sssss> Gemmell is one of the most important fantasy writers of the late 20th century
George Lake		The World of Normal Boys: Books: K. M. Soehnlein		1		This "novel" would be better suited for the stage. <sssss> It reads like a play, often. <sssss> It's not realistic as the author goes overboard in depicting "high drama" within a family. <sssss> They suffer a tragedy that would certainly affect a family but to the extent the author has them changing is not realistic at all. <sssss> There are far too many scenes of shouting, histrionics. <sssss> The father goes from being Ward Cleaver to a verbally abusive monster. <sssss> If I had to see the mother one more time with her calling "Robin!" <sssss> I was going to scream. <sssss> The author needs to understand that high drama and a climax will be inferred by the reader after seeing the conflict. <sssss> This author forces the climax onto us in every scene. <sssss> He's desperate for this end result of angst, high drama and shock. <sssss> It's overkill. <sssss> I don't believe that a 14 year old would become this promiscuous. <sssss> Sure it happens but this was the Leave it to Beaver family at first. <sssss> It just doesn't make sense that because of ONE incident, all members of the family devolve into sordid disasters. <sssss> In short, the author needs to be focused more on telling a story, allowing the reader to infer. <sssss> Instead, he thrusts high drama and climax onto us at every turn. <sssss> It's ironic, actually, as he's trying to make us feel drama but he did it so much that I just felt tedium. <sssss> Very, very contrived and forced novel. <sssss> Not believable. <sssss> I do not recommend
Adrian Geana "Adrian"		An Inconvenient Truth: The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About It: Books: Al Gore		1		Al Gore is making a good road to tell us the facts on Global Warming , but he is missing the fact that in 3-4 years we will have the New Ice Age coming and Billion of people on Earth will die and he is missing 40-60 % of the cause of the Global Warming. <sssss> The book is good and bad. <sssss> We can stop this Global Warming in one month. <sssss> But we cant' do it untill we will expose the real cause of it. <sssss> Think about: in one month we can stop it. <sssss> Each month ( in the next 2 years )we will postpone the truth is just bad. <sssss> The movie is good and bad. <sssss> Is bad in 90% and good in 10%. <sssss> He put enormous work in it , so many government agencies he is using for this ( mostly) But he is missing the main point. <sssss> He will need to change that in the next movie and this is the main point. <sssss> As a government employee he will never be able to tell the truth. <sssss> is going to be all the time wixh wash.... We will need to get this work from this stage and do it under an independent ( no government involvement) study. <sssss> Adria
Nancy Kelly		Sanctuary: Books: Nora Roberts		2		Just LOVED this book!!! <sssss> Enjoy Nora Roberts books but this one is now at the top of my list. <sssss> It is so suspenseful you can hardly wait to turn the next page to see what happens next. <sssss> This mystery/love story is great and so well written. <sssss> All the characters are so well developed they seem to come to life and just about jump off the page. <sssss> Very enjoyable reading!!! <sssss> !
Alan "Super Luigi"		Lost World: Books: Michael Crichton		2		This book has adrenaline written all over it! <sssss> Michael Crighton did an excellent job of keeping readers on their seats. <sssss> I was blown away. <sssss> Not only did his novel have adrenaline, but it also had horror, which kept you waiting for your hand to turn the next page
M.i.B.		Active Directory, 3rd Edition: Books: Joe Richards,Alistair G Lowe-Norris,Robbie Allen		1		Not recommended for native speakers of the English language. <sssss> When trees == forests and top-level directories are instead 'naming contexts' .... <sssss> The desirable format would be "This feature, which MS call 'X', is 'Y' plain english", but instead the Y feature will only ever be called X. <sssss> This is not a helpful book
Bruce Gilliz		Beating the Street: Books: Peter Lynch		2		When Peter S. Lynch speaks, wise investors will listen. <sssss> This book covers the famous fund manager's career at the helm of Fidelity Magellan from 1977 to '90, and post career into '92. <sssss> It's far more introspective than "One Up On Wall Street" and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose. <sssss> For example, there isn't nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former. <sssss> My belief is that the reader would do best by reading "One Up On Wall Street" first and follow up with this title, as its the newer of the two, regardless. <sssss> Peter's style of writing (with John Rothchild) is no-nonsense and easy to take in. <sssss> To my knowledge three books have been published by the duo and all three have been entertaining and never dry. <sssss> The reader can comfortably take in some very important stock-picking principles from one of the greats without feeling intimidated at any point. <sssss> I think this is a sign of a well written book that covers a topic that isn't child's play (unless you like playing with money). <sssss> And although this book doesn't cover nearly as much technical information as the first, it still offers a lot of tasty tidbits for stock pickers. <sssss> I made plenty of notes while reading "Beating The Street", and I'm confident that I'll be well served by doing so. <sssss> Peter reiterates many of the guidelines he mentioned in his first best-seller, such as scrutinizing company earnings and the balance sheets, and he gives his wise opinion of picking bargain stocks that have lower P/Es than their growth rates. <sssss> Overall, this title definitely deserves four stars, and his first book deserves at least five stars. <sssss> Lynch and Rothchild have authored several investing books that will stand the test of time. <sssss> You'll sleep better with your investment decisions by having these valuable classics in your collection.
Alan Carroll		Know Your Woods: Books: Constantin		1		I don't understand why anyone would publish a book anymore with black and white illustrations. <sssss> I know this is supposed to be a classic and all that so it's my own fault for not checking when I read the description. <sssss> I don't even know why I'm keeping it; I'll never read it. <sssss> You have to wade through tons of technical jargon and lengthy chapters that would be much better served by some large color photographs. <sssss> Maybe that makes me shallow, I don't know, but there are much more 'complete guides' out there on this topic these days
Bog Trotter		Pulp: Books: Charles Bukowski		1		Hands down this is Bukowski's single worst book. <sssss> Bought it when it first came out just before/after his death in 1994. <sssss> Having read just about everything the man had written, "Pulp" was a hugely disappointing epitaph. <sssss> If you've never read Bukowski start with "Post Office" or the short story collections, but avoid this like the plague. <sssss> A bad book. <sssss> I can't think of a single reason to recommend it
Karen		Hard Truth: Books: Nevada Barr		1		I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. <sssss> After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. <sssss> Murder's not nasty enough? <sssss> How about the murder of children? <sssss> Still not gruesome enough? <sssss> Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture. <sssss> Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? <sssss> The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. <sssss> It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing. <sssss> In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. <sssss> I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. <sssss> I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it
Kimberly		Life Laughs: The Naked Truth about Motherhood, Marriage, and Moving On: Books: Jenny McCarthy		1		this book was very disappointing. <sssss> i LOVED her 1st two books. <sssss> so when this book came out i was very excited. <sssss> after reading it, i found it was rather dull and not very funny. <sssss> there were very few parts that actually made me laugh, unlike her 1st two books
T. Reise		The Client (Limited Edition): Books: John Grisham		1		My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction. <sssss> The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility. <sssss> Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion. <sssss> Absurd! <sssss> No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing! <sssss> The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy. <sssss> Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases. <sssss> Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago. <sssss> Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall. <sssss> First Grisham = LAST Grisham
Milo		Architecture and Mathematics in Ancient Egypt: Books: Corinna Rossi		1		Several reviews of this book, published elsewhere, stress the contents of Rossi's analysis were more focused toward the skeptical side of Egyptian math and construction methods. <sssss> Rossi, therefore is being fairly depicted as publishing new information within unproven paradigms. <sssss> On the math side, Rossi mentions Fibonacci's algorithm and phi, two paradigms that clearly were not used in ancient Egypt, though many like to suggest that they were. <sssss> The Fibonacci algorithm idea was introduced after 1891 and J.J. Sylvester's skeptical views of the RMP's 2/nth table, are reference point to 1202 AD and the Liber Abaci, but not a reference point of Egypt. <sssss> Egypt used more subtle ideas like http://egyptianmath.blogspot.com and http://akhmimwoodentablet.blogspot.com . <sssss> Yet, Hultsch in 1895 clearly showed that Ahmes in 1650 BC easily wrote out 2/p series into short and concise unit fraction series using a very simple partitioning method (as Ahmes wrote out n/p answers in his 'false position' algebra problems, ie. <sssss> 5/19 written out in a long awkward series using 1/12th as the first partition, as he did for 2/19, as describe a couple paragraphs below. <sssss> Ahmes wrote 5/19 per, 5/19 - 1/12 = (60 - 19)/(12*19) = (38 + 2 + 1)/(12*19) or, 5/19 = 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/114 + 1/228). <sssss> Clearly modern scholars (two being Robins-Shute) have often suggested that 'false supposition' was used by Ahmes, hinting that Ahmes guessed at his answers. <sssss> Ahmes never guessed! <sssss> Ahmes' answers were always exact when he worked with rational numbers. <sssss> Moderm scholars were the ones that had guessed, and missed, finding Ahmes deeper methods. <sssss> Interestingly no scholar, until very recently, has claimed to have read Ahmes' shorthand notes. <sssss> Modern scholars had sadly filled inlogical gaps left by Ahmes with their own intellectual guesses - many of which have been proven to be wrong (as Rossi had not learned, since he referenced none of the controversial Eguptian fraction and weights and measures issues). <sssss> Bruins also discovered the Hultsch method in 1945, and today the method is named the Hultsch-Bruin method. <sssss> It says that 2/p = 1/A + (2A -p)/Ap where A, a highly divisible number selected in the range p/2 pppppppppp lt; A pppppppppp lt; p with the divisors of A uniquely added to (2A -p) thereby solving (2A-p)/Ap. <sssss> Example, 2/19 = 1/12 + (24 -19)/(12*19) = 1/12 + (3 + 2)/(12*19) = 1/12 + 1/76 + 1/114 with the (4 + 1) alternative being discarded since its last denominator was too large. <sssss> Rossi also mentions that Egyptian division may have followed an inverse operation of its multiplication 'doubling' method. <sssss> Here also Rossi did not seen the simple remainder arithmetic found in RMP #62 where 100/13 = 7 + 9/13 = 7 + 2/3 + 1/39. <sssss> Generally Ahmes and all scribes divided by this Q = quotient and R = remainder method. <sssss> The Akhmim Wooden Tablet even shows a special method for grain and volume division where a hekat unity 64/64 was divided by n, with n pppppppppp lt; 64, as (64/64)/n = Q/64 + R/(n*64) Even more interesting, Ahmes also used this method to divide 100 hekat by 70, with his final form matching the Akhmim Wooden tablet's special use of ro = 1/320th of a hekat, by: (6400/64)/70 = 91/64 + 30/(70*64) and introducing ro = 1/320 of a hekat, = (1 +16 + 8+ 2 + 1)/64 = (150/70)* 1/320 = 1+ 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/32+ 1/64 + (2 + 1/7)*ro I'll not go on and discuss Rossi' view of Egyptian architecture being the above her standard Cambridge skeptical comments. <sssss> Overall, many accept Rossi's view as informative, and I do as well, in limited areas. <sssss> However, on the math side of Rossi's quick use of a Sylvester's and other recent skeptical techniques, all disproven years ago, shows that her Cambridge training needs to be expanded to read the Egyptian mathematical texts. <sssss> Clearly Ahmes and his brother/sister scribes are the only experts that should guide our understanding of Egyptian math.
Tasha Jessup		GPU Gems 2: Programming Techniques for High-Performance Graphics and General-Purpose Computation (Gpu Gems): Books: Matt Pharr,Randima Fernando		2		"GPU Gems 2" edited by Matt Pharr (Addison-Wesley, 2005, ISBN 0-321-33559-7) is a collection of forty-eight white papers that detail cutting edge techniques based on today's latest graphical processing units (GPU). <sssss> The full color hardcover text is 784 pages and includes a CD-ROM with working demos and source for some of the articles presented in the book. <sssss> The text retails for $59.99. <sssss> The book is divided into six parts: geometric complexity, shading, high-quality rendering, general purpose computation on the GPU, image oriented computing, and numerical algorithms. <sssss> A part has anywhere from five to twelve chapters. <sssss> Each chapter is written by a different author but the format and style is consistent. <sssss> The chapters have an introduction, discussion of the problem or technique, conclusion, and references. <sssss> The material is presented with color illustrations and occasionally some pseudo-code or code fragments. <sssss> Generally, the material is extremely current and very approachable to read. <sssss> As a sequel to its well received predecessor, the text focuses on taking advantage of the computational power and features of today's high-powered GPU boards. <sssss> The first part of the book, geometric complexity, emphasizes this with chapters dedicated to batch rendering, using multi-streaming, hardware occlusion, and displacement pixel-shaders. <sssss> Each chapter illustrates how operations traditionally performed on the CPU can be moved into the GPU for efficiency and greater effect. <sssss> The subsequent two parts on shading and rendering continue along the same theme: improved performance by using hardware functionality found on the GPU. <sssss> Each topic considers the performance ramifications and GPU capabilities when discussing the problem domain of a rendering technique and factors it into the final solution. <sssss> For example, chapter 10 considers irradiance environment maps for fast lighting - but with a twist - using the GPU to do the calculations in real-time. <sssss> In doing so, the book's real value becomes apparent. <sssss> The fourth part on general purpose GPU computation is an interesting addition to the text. <sssss> The chapters illustrate methods of offloading traditional CPU tasks by exploiting the inherent parallel nature of modern GPU hardware. <sssss> Since the book features Nvidia hardware, the architecture and performance capabilities largely focused on their products. <sssss> In the fifth part of the book, hardware assisted image creation and analysis is considered. <sssss> By using context clues from the spatial, texture, or lighting data - additional refinements can be made to a scene prior to rasterization. <sssss> The topics presented in this part are further refinements of the text's main theme (using the GPU fully) and are specific solutions to uncommon problems - or approaches to rasterization. <sssss> None the less as GPUs continue to evolve, the topics presented in this section will undoubtedly become more common. <sssss> Finally, the sixth part of the book provides several non-traditional graphics examples to illustrate calculating data on the GPU: solving linear equations, options pricing, and numerical simulation - just to name a few. <sssss> As using the raw floating point power of modern GPU is a growing trend - these sections were quite interesting and well done. <sssss> The included CD-ROM contains examples to 28 of the 48 articles in the book. <sssss> In most cases, the example material includes source code as well as pre-compiled binaries to help illustrate the topic presented in the text. <sssss> In order to run the majority of the samples, Cg must be installed on the host computer. <sssss> In addition, the CD-ROM provides access to Nvidia's software development kit, Cg toolkit, performance tools, and several helpful reference links to on-line sites. <sssss> GPU Gems 2 provides a cutting edge view of the capabilities found in today's video cards. <sssss> The selected articles illustrate that every part of the rendering process can be enhanced in some fashion by fully using the underlying hardware. <sssss> As such, this book is essential to anyone working with modern GPUs.
Irene Belesiotis "Reading teacher"		The Lotus Seed: Books: Sherry Garland,Tatsuro Kiuchi		2		This book is great for encouraging students to ask questions and infer meaning! <sssss> Try it out in the classroom
L. K. Elmore		Ladder of Years: Books: Anne Tyler		1		Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. <sssss> I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! <sssss> I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" <sssss> - good point! <sssss> It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. <sssss> Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! <sssss> After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. <sssss> What a disappointment
T. Walker		Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland (Thirty Three and a Third series): Books: John Perry		1		If your into Hendrix enough to want to find out more about Electric Ladyland, your probably already going to know everything in this book. <sssss> If you've read such great Hendrix books such as 'Electric Gypsy' then you won't get much from this book other than information obtained that you've read before from 'Electric Gypsy' coloured in this authors opinion on Jimi's music. <sssss> The author lays down his opinion that reads like someone either not overly impressed by Jimi Hendrix, or someone that has trouble laying praise where it's due. <sssss> The author makes big calls in this book which fall flat, for example expressing his view on how Jimi could of edited and recorded certain songs better in his opinion (not unlike like Alan Douglas made true) or ego trips like footnotes after mentioning 'Like A Rolling Stone' at Monterey can only be outdone by the rare hard to find Flamingo Club version in 1968 - where does he get that from? <sssss> The Flamingo club version is near inaudiable for most of the recording with its vocals and the guitar very distorted at the very least and is no way a superior rendition than Monterey but the book has many little comments by the author like that which only makes you think, is this guy trying to brag about his Hendrix collection? <sssss> Or does he just have to have a different opinion on everything to try and make his book, which really has nothing new, stand out from the pack? <sssss> His opinions would be valid if he didn't try to go against the grain to just go against the grain! <sssss> If you've ever heard or seen Jimi at Monterey you don't need to be told how so many people thought he played crap that night - the evidence that this is one of his greatest performances is right there on CD or on the screen as you watch it which just makes bringing up that negative side without balancing it with the many rave reviews he also got seem targeted. <sssss> Why point out the bad things and not mention the good? <sssss> If you want to learn the technical side of the recording or the technical side of Hendrix, you won't learn it from this book. <sssss> You'll get the classic Hendrix bio for most of it with this Authors strange comments, some bad reviews for Electric Ladyland to show Hendrix was human after all i guess and an author bringing up all his 'friends' and 'visits' to people that are well documented in knowing Jimi. <sssss> All in all, if you have no opinion on Hendrix and read this you probably won't think he's that great and get a distorted opinion on him, if you love Hendrix and read this you'll wonder why this Author bothered to write a book about Jimi in the first place other than to let us know he has so many friends that knew Jimi, was lucky enough to see him play a few times and the funniest of all, could of done some things better in his opinion. <sssss> Two stars because there's many books out there with much more information about Electric Ladyland, let alone Hendrix, that aren't trying to re-write Jimi's history from one person's perspective and critique thou it's cheap and quite funny if you have a big Hendrix library anyway.
Former Witness		Message in a Bottle (Thorndike Large Print Basic Series): Books: Nicholas Sparks		1		While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference. <sssss> I'm extremely surprised this is a "best seller". <sssss> Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this. <sssss> Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. <sssss> I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. <sssss> I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear
W. Bynum		Made in Detroit: Books: Paul Clemens		1		Before purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews. <sssss> The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead. <sssss> As it turns out I made the best decision. <sssss> All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers'; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price. <sssss> My statement has nothing to do with the author's writing skills, he is a skilled writer. <sssss> It has everything to do with his lack of insight. <sssss> That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary. <sssss> I read the book, waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them. <sssss> But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one. <sssss> Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Paul's life hard. <sssss> Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice. <sssss> He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book. <sssss> If you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings. <sssss> If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage. <sssss> As I read this book I felt sadness, a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed. <sssss> (There are white folks who actually still think like this.) <sssss> My hope is that the light comes on for Paul, he is still young. <sssss> If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.
Novel Reader "just a review . . ."		Late Great Planet Earth, The: Books: Hal Lindsey		1		Many reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. <sssss> (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) <sssss> If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault. <sssss> Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. <sssss> After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. <sssss> We were searching and seeking. <sssss> We didn't have all of the facts. <sssss> There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. <sssss> Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'. <sssss> For most of us, our minds matured. <sssss> We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. <sssss> We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others. <sssss> This is beyond dangerous. <sssss> It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out. <sssss> I love a good horror novel. <sssss> I love a good 'true crime' thriller. <sssss> But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined. <sssss> That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. <sssss> The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. <sssss> Please don't be the next sucker. <sssss> Please don't add this one to your cart.
A reader		Poker Without Cards: A Consciousness Thriller: Books: Ben Mack		1		Very disappointed with it. <sssss> Was expecting something groundbreaking, but it failed to deliever. <sssss> An easy read and quite honestly, boring. <sssss> Don't waste your time. <sssss> Read something more worthwile like Robert Anton Wilson.
Aura Mae		Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day: Books: Judith Viorst		2		I can recite most of it from memory, I love it so! <sssss> I tell people about it all the time and recommend it (along with Alexander Who Used To Be Rich Last Sunday) as a staple in every library. <sssss> It's a great one to have even if you don't have kids (sometimes the little buggers show up for visits!) <sssss> This book does a hilarious job of pointing out to kids that some days just stink and that you live through them anyway. <sssss> The illustations have some great humor for the adults. <sssss> Read it aloud to someone you love! <sssss> Aura Mae, Author of Get Some Hairapy - a hairdresser's prescription for happiness
Peter		For Women Only! Your Guide to Health Empowerment: Books: Gary Null,Barbara Seaman		2		Thank you, Dr. Null, for holistically addressing the health concerns that are predominant in women. <sssss> The politics behind female healthcare are shocking and frightening. <sssss> You put it all into perspective within these covers. <sssss> You also saved me from the quandary of what to buy all the women in my family for Christmas. <sssss> You're insightful and have a wealth of helpful information. <sssss> Bless you
chilenopo "chilenopo"		Gods and Generals: Books: Jeff Shaara		2		I was stunned at how much I enjoyed this book. <sssss> I had avoided it for years since I was not a big fan of the movie. <sssss> This book really explains well both the history of the Civil War (troop movements, etc) as well as the personalities of its participants. <sssss> It is an intimate portrayal of these characters, especially Lee and Jackson. <sssss> I found it to be quite compelling and I'm looking forward to book three of the trilogy
Marc S. Whitney "eichhoernchen"		The Great Wave: Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History: Books: David Hackett Fischer		1		Compared to his other superb books, this is one is tedious and boring. <sssss> The overall thesis is a stretch - trying to find equivalences between pre-industrial (and pre-printing press) 13th century price paterns and those of the industrialized and post-industrial 20th century requires ignoring far to many factors. <sssss> At a minimum comparing a world in which 90% of the population are attached to agricultural production and illiterate to world where almost precicly the reverse holds is just too big a leap to swallow. <sssss> Sadly, one suspects more than a little political axe-grinding is involved. <sssss> Enjoy Fischer's other books where he excells, but you won't miss much if you neglect to read The Great Wave. <sssss> Besides, the subject has been better treated elsewhere by authors not so obviously out of their depth
Dr. Benjamin "Intelligent Choice"		Category Five: The Hurricane-Force Novel: Books: Philip S. Donlay		1		The story opens well and hooks the reader. <sssss> However, the ending is a disappointment and comes across as cliche and predictable. <sssss> I gave it two stars because there was not a category for a 1 and a half
jessk "jessk"		Drowning Ruth: Books: Christina Schwarz		1		This book irritated me on many levels; not that the writing was poor or the plot weak. <sssss> In fact, the plot, the premise, the writing were good--unfortunately the characters didn't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable. <sssss> I read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction--regardless of plot--is because they care about someone in the book. <sssss> In this book, I was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story...
R. Albin		The Second World War: Books: John Keegan		1		The very first thing you read in this book is a mistake. <sssss> The Prologue begins with a photo of German POWs at the end of WWI. <sssss> The photo caption states that the German Army at the end of WWI was "unbroken" and implies that Germany capitulated because of a loss of will on the part of its political leadership. <sssss> This is doubly misleading. <sssss> The German Army was soundly defeated on Western Front in 1918 and then began to disintegrate. <sssss> In 1918, Germany was essentially a military dictatorship run by Ludendorff and Hindenberg. <sssss> The political leaders who lost will were the German High Command. <sssss> Defeat on the battlefield and despair on the part of senior commanders hardly meets the description of an unbroken army. <sssss> Keegan is essentially repeating the pernicious "stab in the back" myth used by the German military and right wing propagandists to undermine the Weimar republic. <sssss> Its astonishing to see this published decades later by someone who is supposed to be an expert on such matters. <sssss> This type of error recurs throughout this book. <sssss> My favorite relatively minor error is Keegan moving the Ploesti oilfields, a major strategic resource, from Romania to Hungary. <sssss> See prior reader reviews for documentation of a number of factual errors of varying magnitude. <sssss> Just as important and in some cases even more important are Keegan's failures to discuss crucial aspects of WWII. <sssss> He makes little effort, for example, to discuss the origins of the war. <sssss> Indeed, his paragraphs on this topic suggest that he finds it too confusing to discuss. <sssss> Leaving aside his shirking of his obligation to discuss this crucial topic, there are excellent overviews of 20s and 30s that are good guides to this admittedly formidable topic. <sssss> Instead of an effort to discuss the origins of the war, we get a superficial and somewhat misleading discussion of how industrialization transformed military technology and organization. <sssss> Instead of a discussion of the sad history of the Weimar Republic, crucial for understanding the ascent of the Nazis, we get another misleading discussion of the Freikorps phenomenon. <sssss> Among other significant omissions are his failure to grapple with the possible strategic significance of the Allied bombing campaign against Germany, a issue analyzed insightfully by Richard Overy in 2 of his excellent books. <sssss> Keegan's discussion of the Holocaust in both inadequate and implicitly misleading. <sssss> Partly because he doesn't discuss the origins of the war and the role played by Nazi ideology in starting the war he fails to show that in crucial respects the Holocaust was the point of German aggression. <sssss> The Nazis went to war not just to overturn the Versailles settlement or even to conquer Eastern Europe, but to impose their bizarre notions of racial conflict on the rest of Europe. <sssss> Without this background, its impossible to understand the outbreak and the specific nature of WWII. <sssss> Among other things, Nazi racism prevented them from rationally exploiting the resources of the western Soviet Union, a factor in their eventual defeat. <sssss> As pointed out by other reviewers, Keegan devotes a disproportionate amount of the book to activities of the Western allies when the Eastern front was really the crucial theatre. <sssss> To be fair to Keegan, writing a concise 1 volume book like this is very difficult. <sssss> The best 1 volume work on WWII is Gerhard Weinberg's book, which is about 1000 pages of text in a fairly small font. <sssss> Some of the individual sections of this book are quite good and Keegan has a nice, sometimes actually elegant, writing style. <sssss> None of these positive features, however, can overcome his neglect of basic features of WWII and the lack of attention to basic facts. <sssss> This is not just error, this is actual negligence.
Jimmy Hayde (HAYDEJ@NTR.NET)		Stengel: His Life pppppppppp T: Books: Robert Creamer		2		pppppppppp quot;Stengel: His Life and Times pppppppppp quot; is no mere biography. <sssss> It is a chronicle, not only of the earlier days of baseball, but of America itself. <sssss> As a biography, it is superlative. <sssss> As a history book, it stands on it's own merits
First Lady of Long Beach "Lady"		Skipping Christmas: Books: John Grisham		1		If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story. <sssss> The end. <sssss> Instead, they end up having to scramble to try pppppppppp make Christmas "happen" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home. <sssss> In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! <sssss> Christ's birth. <sssss> I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it. <sssss> Why torture yourself? <sssss> It would have been a good story if they did this. <sssss> Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of "making Christmas happen." <sssss> A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read. <sssss> Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it
Tyson		Feuer and Martin Present Guys pppppppppp Dolls: A Musical Fable of Broadway/Vocal Score/Hl00447926 (Score): Books: Frank Loesser		2		Guys and Dolls is a fantastic musical, and this vocal selections book is a good representation of it. <sssss> Unfortunately, some songs like Marry The Man Today, My Time Of Day, Follow The Fold and The Oldest Established have been left out from the book, but that is the price you pay, or rather don't pay, when you don't buy the full vocal score. <sssss> However, this book will satisfy fans of the show, complete with pictures from the original 1950 Broadway production, the 1955 film, and the New 1992 Broadway Revival. <sssss> Definately, this book is a good buy
		So You Want to Start a Nursery: Books: Tony Avent		1		Having a plant nursery for 20 years I can tell you if this book is you only resource be in for a wild ride. <sssss> He states many places what has cause him the most problems, but no one starts a nursey the same and workable ideas would be better than the work he calls stressful and more important than growing plants. <sssss> Our nursery is the opposite of stressful and has so many happy rewards never mention in this book.........Very little help on selling and getting customers also
A. Young "aly"		The Worst Hard Time: The Untold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl: Books: Timothy Egan		2		I found this to be a real page-turner. <sssss> It addressed all the issues leading to the near destruction of the High Plains in the 1930s: agricultural, social, political. <sssss> Dealing heavily with first-person accounts, I learned about the Dust Bowl, the depression, and the psychology of the times. <sssss> Great book
Jewel Allie "JA"		Captains Courageous (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio)): Books: Rudyard Kipling,David Stuart		2		Harvey is a totally spoiled boy. <sssss> It starts when Harvey is on a ship with his Mother (I forget where they are going) he is washed overboard, and saved by a fisherman `Manuel.' <sssss> On the fishing boat Harvey makes his first friend, learns to work for his keep and so on. <sssss> The story worked, it wasn't cheesy, maybe because it was one of the first novels of that type, but the plot of Harvey "growing up" seemed just to be there so you will read the book. <sssss> The characters were well developed except the cook, you never really figure out where he is coming from. <sssss> Most of the book was about fishing of The Grand Banks, very interesting is you like fishing and ships, but if you are reading it for the story, there is not that much, the ending was also weak, we are happy the Harvey is reconciled, but I really think that his parents would make a bigger stink. <sssss> Good historical value, Kipling is a very enjoyable writer, yes I liked it but the plot had some flaws. <sssss> I do recommend it though.
Nese Pamuk		Lipstick Jungle: A Novel: Books: Candace Bushnell		1		The book was fun but the fact that it is too long overshadowed all this fun. <sssss> I got the impression it was rather written to become a movie. <sssss> All I can say is that thanks to C.Bushnell for 'Sex and the City'.
Roger Long "longrush"		For Love of the Game: Books: Michael Shaara		1		I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan. <sssss> The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher. <sssss> It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot. <sssss> The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories. <sssss> The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there. <sssss> Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work. <sssss> Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees. <sssss> Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear. <sssss> The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season. <sssss> Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field. <sssss> This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels." <sssss> It's unfortunate. <sssss> There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book
Helen Metropoulos		Never in a Hurry: Essays on People and Places: Books: Naomi Shihab Nye		2		Naomi Shihab Nye is a bridge-builder. <sssss> She reaches out to those of other cultures, and always expresses understanding of those sometimes forgotten in our society. <sssss> A good book for all ages
M. Gardner "seinfan63"		Emma's Secret (Bradford, Barbara Taylor): Books: Barbara Taylor Bradford		1		I would normally not read Barbara Taylor Bradford but my boyfriends' Mom gave it to me as part of a present, so I said what the heck, I'll try it. <sssss> Just as disappointing as I'd expected. <sssss> Light, uninteresting, and with no real plot or ending. <sssss> As for the historical pages, read Catherine Cookson instead. <sssss> I may go back and listen to A Woman of Substance only because other reviewers seemed to have enjoyed it. <sssss> But this sequel was too into clothes and the finer things, and full of too-successful, too-beautiful men and women. <sssss> Not believable.
Michael D. Archer		Birds Opening: Detailed Coverage of an Underrated and Dynamic Choice for White (Everyman Chess): Books: Timothy Taylor		1		I own perhaps 20 books on the Bird's and this is one of the worse. <sssss> Mostly because the material is so poorly organized; no real attempt is made to sort through the (admittedly tangled) move orders/motifs/variations in this opening. <sssss> Also, the author seems to have a 'bad attitude' even though he plays the opening and has several examples in the book. <sssss> The section on the Leningrad Dutch-Reversed is better than the others but still lifeless. <sssss> The entire Everyman opening series has deteriorated a great deal the past two years and I'm about done buying any new ones, especially if they are as bad as Bird's Opening.
Dovely "Ravenous reader"		The Runaway Bunny: Books: Margaret Wise Brown,Clement Hurd		2		This book brought tears to my eyes the first time I read it. <sssss> It is warm and comforting. <sssss> A wonderful message for children that their mama will always be there no matter what..
Raymond Jensen "rjensen2"		America's Uncivil Wars: The Sixties Era from Elvis to the Fall of Richard Nixon: Books: Mark Hamilton Lytle		1		Lets say you were reading a book on the mafia, written by John Gotti, or perhaps some lesser-known mobster. <sssss> And there was nothing but glowing accolades for the mob and it's activities. <sssss> Furthermore, anyone who opposed the mafia and it's activities was labeled an "extremist" and in the text, their names were never more than about 4 or 5 words away from words like "Ku Klux Klan," "racist," "bigoted," or "paranoid," you'd begin to suspect that the book was a bit biased, wouldn't you? <sssss> "Americas Uncivil Wars" is a book written by Mark Lytle, a professor at Bard College. <sssss> He documents events in American History, in this book, from the 1950's to about 1975. <sssss> Practically every time a genuine conservative individual, or organization is mentioned in this book, it is associated to a racist organization, whenever Mr. Lytle doesn't add his own commentary. <sssss> For example, on page 22, he says Joseph McCarthy revealed himself as a "mean-spirited slob." <sssss> This is a far cry from the McCarthy I know, the McCarthy who wrote the brilliant "Americas Retreat from Victory" for example. <sssss> And forget about anything good mentioned about the John Birch Society. <sssss> Page 138: "Most Americans ignored the hooded Klansmen, the John Birchers, and other extremists..." never mind the fact that JBS is not and never was a racist or an extremist organization. <sssss> But here is their name, sandwiched between the KKK and "extremist." <sssss> It is a typical tactic of the left to associate the opposition with the "stench of racism" as Stalin may have put it (I don't remember his exact quote). <sssss> But you might ask, what about on page 89 where he refers glowingly to William F. Buckley as "the cornerstone of the anti-communist wing of conservatism...?" <sssss> Keep in mind that this is the same Buckley who years later, in Lingua Franca magazine, confessed that he would be a "Mike Harrington Socialist" or a "Communist" if he were college brat today. <sssss> Now on the other hand, try to find anywhere in this book, the words "murderer," or even "extremist" in front of names like Mao Tse Tung, or Che Guevara or Tom Hayden, to name a few. <sssss> There is a good reason for that, but I will leave it to your imagination, the reason why. <sssss> In summary, should you decide to read this book, take it with a grain of salt, or better yet some motion-sickness pills because unless you are prone to the same convictions as our professor Lytle is, you're going to need a barf-bag
Rolf Dobelli		Fish! Tales with DVD: Real-Life Stories to Help You Transform Your Workplace and Your Life (Fish): Books: Stephen C. Lundin,John Christensen,Harry Paul		2		Things are going swimmingly in Fish! <sssss> land. <sssss> In the latest volume, Fish! <sssss> Tales, authors Stephen C. Lundin, John Christensen, Harry Paul and Philip Strand build on the successful training program that evolved from their first Fish book. <sssss> Tales shows how four companies - a long-distance call center; a hospital neural-renal unit, a car dealership and a roofing company - have applied Fish! <sssss> theories effectively. <sssss> They also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the Fish! <sssss> function. <sssss> The four main principles are familiar by now - keep the work fun, seek to serve others, stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude - but the examples in the book bring them alive. <sssss> Along the way, the authors heavily sell their Fish! <sssss> courses and merchandise - that's just good salesmanship - but the real catch of the day is the final how-to section, showing ways to apply these principles in any organization. <sssss> The lively writing style helps keep you hooked. <sssss> We suggest that if you haven't yet caught any Fish!, start with this one. <sssss> Its cheery, accessible methods should lure you in, hook, line and sinker
"alchemist375"		State and Revolution: Marxist Teaching about the Theory of the State and the Tasks of the Proletariat in the Revolution: Books: Vladimir Il'ich Lenin		2		This is an excellent book on the role of the state after a revolution, how it will wither away, and what a society should look like ( or try to mould itself into ) after the revolution. <sssss> Lenin, drawing on the works of Marx and Engels extensively, refutes many claims by both the Anarchists and opportunists on the role of the state, and corrects many common errors believed about the Marxist road to Socialism. <sssss> This is a thoroughly informative read. <sssss> I recommend those wondering how a Communist society would emerge after a revolution to get this book; It will open your eyes widely
LisaLisa "kldckldc"		Boulevard: The Cookbook: Books: Nancy Oakes,Pamela Mazzola,Lisa Weiss		2		Having patronized Boulevard all but twice, I still feel the need to write a review. <sssss> You have to understand that those of us "Back East" think that California food is understated and so easy. <sssss> Now not being a huge chef myself, but cooking a bit and doing some experimentation and emulation of real chef's recipes (my fave restaurants being of course, Boulevard, and back east, 2941, Le Tire Bouchon, Maestro, Citronelle DC, Galileo, Inn at Little Washington, etc.). <sssss> I have no clue where I'd get some of the ingredients in this cookbook, other than maybe the San Francisco Ferry building's fabulous farmer's market (another real SF treat!). <sssss> But to be real, we have to sometimes improvise on ingredients. <sssss> Do what you can with what you have locally and you might be surprised. <sssss> Now I was spoiled with a fabulous waiter at Boulevard who asked the chef to let me know what was in one of the recipes and I have her handwriting -- just ingredients, no measurements. <sssss> And yes, I've been able to improvise, and her very treasured scribe is in my own personal collection of "recipes." <sssss> But nothing is better than going to the restaurant. <sssss> Cookbooks are fab and fun, but getting the realy cooked food directly from the professionals (herselves) are even more exciting. <sssss> Buy this book even just for the photographs, as I've never been in a more well-decorated and well-thought-out restaurant. <sssss> If only I didn't live on the East Coast!
tommi		Tough Choices: A Memoir: Books: Carly Fiorina		1		What a waste of time. <sssss> This was like sitting through a very boring business course. <sssss> I was never interested in turning the page. <sssss> I would have liked to see more of Carly personal side and maybe some human aspect to this story.Instead I felt like a robot was telling this story.Very much of how great her business style was and very little about anything else. <sssss> I forced myself to finish this. <sssss> A huge diaappointment.Don't waste your money
armchairinterviews.com		Over Her Dead Body: Books: Kate White		2		Kate White introduces us to the world of tabloid reporting in a sassy titillating crime novel--Over Her Dead Body. <sssss> I could feel the slime drip off the characters that were responsible for keeping the Buzz and its rag competitors in production. <sssss> While the mention of 'current' celebrities will date this book, Kate's spellbinding storytelling definitely has staying power. <sssss> Over Her Dead Body is a fast-paced novel about the murder of the Mona Hodges, Editor in Chief of the Buzz, who had a long list of hostages in her wake, each one having good reason to hate her or perhaps kill her-with a sprinkling of romance for levity. <sssss> Even though the main character, Bailey Weggins, a celebrity crime writer, gets discombobulated many times throughout the investigation, she is clever enough to pull together the pieces of the mystery to its conclusion. <sssss> Right to the end Kate White keeps the reader guessing on who did this horrible crime. <sssss> I am looking forward to reading more Bailey Weggins' mysteries. <sssss> Don't keep us waiting, Kate! <sssss> Armchair Interviews says: Sounds like another good summer read.
