A. Ovitt		A Path with Heart: A Guide Through the Perils and Promises of Spiritual Life: Books: Jack Kornfield		2		I highly recommend this book. <sssss> It has changed the way I look at life and spirituality. <sssss> Nearly every line in the book is filled with profound meaning. <sssss> Additonally, the style is clear and the ideas accessible for anyone who is truly interested in spiritual fulfillment. <sssss> I am at greater peace with the world since having read this book.
Joe E. Holman		Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought: Books: Pascal Boyer		1		I'm sorry to say, this work will not rate very highly on my scale. <sssss> The author is brilliant, not to mention right on the things he says. <sssss> It's just that the writer's style is so abstract and nebulous that he's absolutely maddening to try and follow. <sssss> One moment, he'll be talking about how religion evolved, and the next he jumps to an illustration that takes half a page and uses language that is so illusive you ask, "What in the world is he saying now?" <sssss> I got so excited in the first chapter while things made sense, and then noticed how he drifted here and there, making good points and then totally abandoning them. <sssss> I bought this book three years ago and just recently finished reading it because I had to keep going out of my way to put it down and come back to it!! <sssss> It never seemed to get better. <sssss> I gleaned a few good points and enjoyed it...well...sort of, but the author is so unclear at times that it drives you nuts - and this is coming from an atheist who agrees with the philosophical position of the author! <sssss> Overall, I really cannot recommend it unless you are a VERY slow, contemplative reader who doesn't mind an unorthodox read. <sssss> Other than that, the book is packed with some good info. <sssss> I just wish I could have gotten to it more easily. <sssss> (JH) www.ministerturnsatheist.or
Matthew Rich "Book Lover"		The Lost World: Books: Michael Crichton		2		This novel was amazing. <sssss> It is just as good as Jurassic Park and I recommend it to anyone who loved Jurassic Park. <sssss> This novel is much better than the movie so if you liked Lost World, then you should definitely read this. <sssss> Crichton realistially extends this series and keeps you entertained throughout the book. <sssss> Once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down
Sarah W. Reeves		Domicilium Decoratus: Hillcrest Estate, Beverly Hills, California: Books: Kelly Wearstler		1		While I very much enjoyed Miss Wearstler's first book, I found Domicilium Decoratus to be borderline obnoxious. <sssss> Rather than show great decorating, the book focused mainly on close up shots of objects in her house that took up the whole page.In addition, I feel that as the viewer of the book I do not need to see fifteen entire pages of Miss Wearstler dressed in ball gowns pretending to be domestic
Midwest Book Review		The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting and Running a Coffee Bar (The Complete Idiot's Guide): Books: Linda Formichelli,W. Eric Martin,Susan Gilbert		2		There's plenty of money to be made in the coffee business and if your dream is to get out there and run a coffee bar, you're in luck: Complete Idiot's Guide To Starting pppppppppp Running A Coffee Bar provides all the basics on how to do so. <sssss> From what it's really like to run a coffee bar to legal issues, sales, shop equipment choices, kitchen layout and more, much of the book is very specific to the coffee industry and provides a wealth of specific business advice.
G-man		Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis: Advice from Twentysomethings Who Have Been There and Survived (Perigee Book): Books: Alexandra Robbins		2		I cannot adequately express what this book did for me. <sssss> I related to many of the stories, followed the advice, and am now a happier, healthier and more successful person than I was before. <sssss> How can you beat that
D. Burkett		I Kissed Dating Goodbye: A New Attitude Toward Relationships and Romance: Books: Joshua Harris		2		Interesting thoughts! <sssss> It makes one think about why we do the things that we do. <sssss> I look forward to sharing some of theses ideas with my daughter when she is a little older. <sssss> I think that it is worth reading. <sssss> A new outlook on dating
Lynne Shaney "sandrag"		Complete Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm: Books: Jack Zipes		1		design of book is very poor--pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story. <sssss> The translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex
Robert J. Nelson		The Monk (World's Classics): Books: Matthew G. Lewis,Howard Anderson		2		This is one of my favorite books of all time, and during my 40 years of life I've read a lot of them. <sssss> First off: the style is simple and direct - no big words and no long sentences. <sssss> But this is by no means to imply that it is unsophisticated. <sssss> As the product of a 19-20 year old mind, it impresses. <sssss> It reads very much like a modern novel. <sssss> This is the kind of novel you wish you could have written yourself - at any age, let alone 19 or 20. <sssss> As such, it is remarkable. <sssss> Secondly: the subject matter is disturbing yet something that must be taught. <sssss> Educated people should know how easy it is to become a hypocrite when how one behaves is determined solely by how he believes the public will react. <sssss> Matthew Lewis was not concerned about this. <sssss> This is what makes him such a great writer. <sssss> Too many contemporary authors are more motivated to write what they believe the public will like than what is in their hearts. <sssss> Lewis' book created a sensation when it was published. <sssss> He probably realized that he was writing a controversial book, but he believed strongly that what he had to say was the truth and that it should be said. <sssss> After all, he was writing during the French Revolution, while the Reign of Terror was raging in Paris. <sssss> People were just beginning to become disillusioned with Reason (because of what they felt it had led to in France), but had yet to become infatuated with sentimentality and passion (as they would during the Romantic era). <sssss> As such, then, it was a time of transition. <sssss> Lewis must have been aware of the danger (as he saw it) of people turning back (as they had during the Middle Ages) to Religion for answers in a time of such upheaval. <sssss> He obviously felt that more Religion was not the answer, that too much Religion can pervert the mind just as too much Reason can. <sssss> This is why his work is still relevant today. <sssss> The battle over what role Religion is to play in society still rages today. <sssss> These are only a few thoughts I hope will be helpful to those who might consider reading this book. <sssss> On the surface, the book is a delightful romp into a fantasy realm. <sssss> Underneath, though, there is a deeper current which reflects the broader course of history and still resonates today
J. Austin "jodylync"		The Doubtful Guest: Books: Edward Gorey		2		Edward Gorey uses gothic illustrations to tell the tale of a strange creature who appears one day in a family's home. <sssss> The prose is an amusing rhyme which describes the family's confusion and frustration at dealing with this unwanted guest. <sssss> Although the illustrations are gothic and dark, the reader is still amused by the creature and the family who must deal with it
Enrique Torres "Rico"		The Complete Book of Herbs: A Practical Guide to Growing and Using Herbs: Books: Lesley Bremness		2		Growing one's herbs is satisfying but using them completes the cycle. <sssss> If you've ever wondered what to do with all the herbs you've managed to put in your garden over the years this book can help you. <sssss> If you are just starting out with herbs this book can get you going properly. <sssss> Not only does it have recipes but it has some ideas that I never could have imagined let alone used. <sssss> The bulk of the book is dedicated to the herbal index which is extremely helpful. <sssss> Each illustrated herb is broken down and expalined simply as to it's use, from root to leaves. <sssss> The only problem I found with this section is that it is organized by their botanical names, which unless you're so inclined is difficult to find quickly. <sssss> This is a minor problem that is remedied by the oversized common name, which of course is not alphabetized but more recognizable. <sssss> A page is dedicated to over 100 of the most common herbs used. <sssss> It tells you how to cultivate the individual herb and it's uses, which includes the medicinal use. <sssss> Even if I don't use all the herbs or have them growing in my garden it is fascinating to know the historical and contemporary use of herbs. <sssss> This book is a constant learning experience that can be read over and over. <sssss> A perfect garden companion for that break under a tree. <sssss> The knowledge can prove to be invaluable. <sssss> Even such common herbs as Thyme can present posssibly new insights into it's benefits. <sssss> Have trouble sleeping? <sssss> The leaves of Thyme can help insomnia as well as stimulate the production of white corpusules to resist infection amongst it's many other attributes. <sssss> There is much more information than I need here but there is something for everyone, from herbal dyes, to baths and massages and to the ever popular potpourri. <sssss> This is, as the title suggests, the complete book on herbs. <sssss> A great book for the kichen or to help you plan your herb garden, this book has as many uses as the author presents uses for the herbs
D. S. Joshi		Victims of Memory: Incest Accusations and Shattered Lives: Books: Mark Pendergrast		2		This is an excellent book examining how and why some people come to believe that they have suffered appalling abuse that most probably never happened. <sssss> It DOES NOT deny the reality of or harm caused by sexual abuse (the author explicitly states this on many occasions) and the reviewer who suggested that this is "a terrific book if you are child molester" probably (I guess) didn't bother reading it and made up the especially foul accusation to prevent others from examining the issues surrounding repressed memory and the cult of therapy. <sssss> The author shows how even trained professionals can disregard overwhelming evidence against a particular hypothesis (repressed memory/MPD/satanic cults) and rely on their intuition to (unintentionally) wreak havoc with their clients lives. <sssss> In the upside-down world of some therapists, lack of hard evidence is trumped by strength of feeling for even the most outrageous accusation. <sssss> Pendergrast demonstrates how uncertain and malleable human memory can be. <sssss> The book is written in an easy style and despite what another particularly stupid review suggests, concentrates specifically on the scientific evidence for his claims
Between the Lines		Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind": Books: Alexandria Ripley		1		Although I really do like Ripley's writing and her stories, this one was shameful what she did to the memory of GWTW. <sssss> I have to blame this on the editors. <sssss> Scarlett was not the colorful character as in GWTW in this so called sequel. <sssss> Publishers and editors should know there is no sequel worthy of the original great classic
M. Wyckoff		Gods and Generals: Books: Jeff Shaara		1		Trash sells and this is the definition of trash. <sssss> Unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction. <sssss> Shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research. <sssss> Readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write
Arlene Millman "chyron24"		Dogtionary: Meaningful Portraits of Dogs: Books: Sharon Montrose		2		Quirky and creative pictorial portrayel of man's best friend. <sssss> Makes the reader feel warm and fuzzy. <sssss> A great gift book. <sssss> Arlene Millman, author of BOOMERANG - A MIRACLE TRILOGY (The tale of a remarkable Boston Terrier)
Book Maven		The Circus Fire: A True Story of an American Tragedy: Books: Stewart O'Nan		1		It is difficult to believe that such a slow and dull book could be written about such a compelling subject. <sssss> The reviewers who have lamented the short, choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another, without benefit of full explanation or connection, are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book. <sssss> I had to read some paragraphs several times and even then didn't understand what I was reading. <sssss> It was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind, as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on. <sssss> The description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages, which incited one yawn after another. <sssss> The book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances. <sssss> For example, the narrative is littered with sentences like: "She made for the east exit..." Okay, fine, but did she run, walk, crawl, hop, skip, jump, or fly to the east exit? <sssss> I just don't know what to picture there. <sssss> The word "made" says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen. <sssss> This type of problem occurs on every page of the book. <sssss> I haven't read anything else the author has written, so I hate to be so critical. <sssss> I wonder, however, why his editor didn't send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions. <sssss> I felt as if I was reading a very hastily-prepared early draft. <sssss> I have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations. <sssss> This just isn't one of them. <sssss> Compare "The Circus Fire" to "Into Thin Air," "Heart of the Sea," "Batavia's Graveyard," or "Ordeal by Hunger" and you'll understand what I mean
Athena "Been there, done that"		Silver Palate Cookbook: Books: Julee Rosso,Sheila Lukins,Michael McLaughlin		1		Sorry guys, I looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media. <sssss> The graphics of the book are truly beautiful. <sssss> The recipes however, hmmm, try again. <sssss> I followed a simple recipe for Apple Crisp and got a bad result. <sssss> I now go to respected standard cookbooks for my Apple Crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great. <sssss> Really people, the recipes are NOT the stuff of greatness. <sssss> Graphics? <sssss> Great. <sssss> Photography? <sssss> Great? <sssss> Recipes? <sssss> You have got to be kidding
Catarino Rodriguez "Curious Reader"		Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq: Books: Stephen Kinzer,Michael Prichard		2		This book tells us the truth that has been hidden from most U.S. citizens for so many years. <sssss> Each chapter tells about a different regime change given us all the dirty little details, names and places of the participants. <sssss> This book helped me and will help all of us to finally understand "why they hate us". <sssss> I only regret that their is not a sequel
Paul Grant "Blessed Are the Uncool"		Every Man's Battle: Winning the War on Sexual Temptation One Victory at a Time (The Every Man Series): Books: Stephen Arterburn,Fred Stoeker,Mike Yorkey		1		We live in a man's world. <sssss> Women are raped, abused, beaten and generally regarded as objects for male gratification. <sssss> This is an epidemic problem, and Christian men are just as great of offenders as the general population. <sssss> So here comes another book on male sexuality, for Christian men. <sssss> The idea is good: rein in the beast. <sssss> But the major defect, which sinks the book, is the self-centered nature of the remedy. <sssss> Christian men are given a toolkit to not look at booty. <sssss> What we are not given is a concrete understanding of compassion. <sssss> It's all self-centered. <sssss> Who cares if the world is just as dangerous for our wives, daughters, and loved ones? <sssss> At least I'm "sexually pure." <sssss> Surely sexual purity includes overthrowing the sexual aggression in society at large? <sssss> This is a life and death situation. <sssss> We will be successful according to the goals we set. <sssss> It is not enough for men to stop lusting. <sssss> We need to fundamentally change the sexual ethics of our society - ethics that aren't greatly concerned with women's well-being. <sssss> If you're only concerned with your own thoughts, this book could be useful. <sssss> But what about the sense of security for the women in our society, who have to live with sexual aggression, cat-calls and "hey-baby"s? <sssss> This book sets shamefully low standards for the church's role in reshaping society, even as it sets admirably high standards for individual men's thought-lives
T.F.		Last Car to Elysian Fields: A Dave Robicheaux Novel: Books: James Lee Burke		1		and I suspect this is what has happened to James Lee Burke. <sssss> The Dave Robicheaux series has been floundering sadly for several books now - and that is tragic, considering the promise of the early books, which peaked in the hauntingly beautiful In The Electric Mist With Confederate Dead. <sssss> I grew up in southern Louisiana, and Burke captures a culture that many people have no experience of. <sssss> But the series is becoming repetitive and stale, culminating in this book, which is just awful. <sssss> Burke's characters, with the exception of the always funny and touching Cletus Purcell, are wearing thin and becoming less and less sympathetic. <sssss> Dave Robicheaux becomes more priceless and preachy in each novel. <sssss> His anti-alcohol tirades would make any Prohibition era preacher proud. <sssss> Burke has fallen into a trap of using the same imagery and phrasing again and again, and it makes the reader wonder if he isn't cutting and pasting entire paragraphs repeatedly. <sssss> If I read one more time in a Burke book that Leadbelly strung his twelve stringed guitar in octaves, I will be sick (hey, Mr. Burke? <sssss> Twelve stringed guitars have always been strung that way, Leadbelly didn't invent that tuning, okay?) <sssss> If I read the word "phallus" in a sex scene in one of Burke's books one more time, I think I will just give up. <sssss> The phrases are getting old - really old. <sssss> The preaching about political corruption and alcohol got old many books ago. <sssss> One thing to be thankful about in this abysmal wreckage of what was once a great series - Bootsie, Dave Robicheaux's wife, is dead, though that doesn't keep her out of the story. <sssss> But at least the reader is spared another element that has been repeated to death - the moment in every book with Bootsie in it where she gets up in the night, angry with Dave, and goes to sleep on the couch. <sssss> I've had bets with other readers as to what page Bootsie will do this inevitable stunt (which then opens up the opportunity for another sex scene with the "phallus" when they kiss and make up) in each Burke novel where she is a character. <sssss> Thankfully, also, Alafair, Dave's adopted daughter, is far away at college, and we are spared her teenaged brattiness which became tedious in the earlier books and yet another repetition of the story of how Dave came to adopt her, which is included in every book since the introduction of the Alafair character. <sssss> It's time for Mr. Burke to let the series go. <sssss> It's a travesty of its former self. <sssss> Reading this book is like visiting a relative who has lost their mind to dementia - you see a hollow, nearly unrecognizable shell of a formerly vital and beloved person. <sssss> It's painful
Kevin Rogers		The Institutes of Christian Religion: Books: John Calvin,Tony Lane,Hilary Osborne		1		Judging by the long reviews before me, it should be obvious that there is much to say about Calvin's theology. <sssss> This book doesn't say too much. <sssss> For those familiar with his theology, DON'T buy this book. <sssss> It will be a waste of your money. <sssss> For those who would like to know more about Calvin's theology, without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology, buy this. <sssss> If you want a good in depth coverage of Calvin's theology, buy the FULL version and enjoy
M. Jorgensen		Put Your House on a Diet: De-Clutter Your Home and Reclaim Your Life: Books: Ed Morrow,Sheree Byofsky,Rita Rosenkranz		1		Bad paper, Old advice. <sssss> Just plain awful and a waste of Money.
Joe		The File: A Personal History: Books: Timothy Garton Ash		1		Timothy Garton Ash's book the file was very provocative and interesting. <sssss> I thoroughly enjoyed reading the personal experience of one man who happened to be in East Berlin before unification and then was able to see his file afterwards. <sssss> However, i am a bit disillusioned. <sssss> The story interests me but Garton Ash really doesn't say anything! <sssss> I am disappointed that he so poignantly and blatantly pokes at communism and a totalitarian state. <sssss> And yet he does not back it up. <sssss> The book is good under the premise of democracy good, communism bad. <sssss> It feels like he is just pooling for support. <sssss> And nobody knew the wall was going to pppppppppp quot;fall pppppppppp quot; when it did. <sssss> I know of many professors who were writing books critiquing communism who had to throw out their text because of the abrupt fall of communism. <sssss> I'm wondering if this book is just a way to cash in an unexpected event. <sssss> I am dissappointed. <sssss> Maybe i just don't know enough of Garton Ash but if this is the case, i should not have to feel the need to know his history before reading the book. <sssss> The book had some good points and kept me entertained but on the whole didn't do anything for me. <sssss> Peace
Mojo Jojo		The Two Princesses of Bamarre: Books: Gail Carson Levine		1		This wasn't such a bad novel, and I kind of enjoyed it. <sssss> Not great, but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly. <sssss> However, the ending really killed it for me. <sssss> It's too unnecessarily long. <sssss> Once the major conflict is resolved, the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah. <sssss> I wish I'd just put the book down after the rain because I would've left with a feeling of at least entertainment. <sssss> But after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications, only pages of explanations, I just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book. <sssss> Would've been three stars if it'd just known when to end
A. Guilmain "designerr"		The Gourmet Cookbook: More Than 1000 Recipes: Books: Ruth Reichl,John Willoughby,Zanne Early Stewart		1		I bought this book with big aspirations of another "Joy of Cooking" with a little upscale to it. <sssss> While I must say the design of the book is fabulous (I am a graphic designer and truly love the cookbook's design), the recipes leave much to pine for. <sssss> I don't like that most of the ingredients are nothing I normally keep in the house and I am not likely to use often enough to warrant purchasing them. <sssss> I have yet to actually cook a meal from it for this reason and I have owned the book for over a year. <sssss> I will stick to "Joy of Cooking" for it is much more of a tool in the kitchen.
Sherry "SCB"		The Mismeasure of Man: Books: Stephen Jay Gould		1		For someone who spends his career attacking politically-motivated science, Stephen Jay Gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book. <sssss> Gould rambles on and on, attacking giants of modern science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton, and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own. <sssss> Gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class. <sssss> Gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct. <sssss> For anyone who has no knowledge of biology, this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science. <sssss> Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist; evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him, and it would be best if he, as well as all other crypto-Marxists who wish to blend science and politics, stay out of it
Greg		Animal Liberation: Books: Peter Singer		2		In the 1970's, Peter Singer came out with a radical argument which was new in the field of ethics; animal liberation. <sssss> While some philosophers and others had in the past, argued for the necessity of being kind to animals (Schopenhauer probably being the most notable case because of his deep respect for Buddhism), Peter Singer was probably the first philosopher in Western philosophy to set out a systematic rational set of arguments for regarding the rights of animals. <sssss> Singer's primary argument, and a very interesting one, is science has demonstrated we show very close connections to many kinds of animals, particularly in the structures of our vital organs, nervous systems and brains. <sssss> Singer gathers some strong evidence from biology showing how many animal species are apparently capable of feeling pain and hence of suffering. <sssss> On these grounds Singer argues animals are entitled to certain rights, at least when they are being used by humans. <sssss> The fact animals can suffer means we can't just treat them as another form of material object or resource for our use, but we need to consider them as fellow beings. <sssss> Singer builds up a set of arguments against eating animals, using animals in agricultural contexts, using animals for scientific experimentation, or using animals for commercial research such as the testing of cosmetic products. <sssss> Singer draws on some infamous and damning experiments which seem to have caused terrible pain and suffering to animals for little apparent gain in scientific knowledge, including the use of 'rape racks' and virtual torture of infant monkeys in one series of experiments. <sssss> At the end of the book, Singer presents several vegetarian recipies and hopes readers will stop eating meat on this example. <sssss> Singer's work has been very powerful in its influence, and several philosophers built on and expanded on his work. <sssss> However, others have criticized his arguments quite strongly, on many grounds. <sssss> It has also become a kind of manifesto for many animal rights campaigners and animal liberationists, some of whom have resorted to violent means to 'free' animals from scientific experimentation. <sssss> While I admire Singer's rigorous arguments as well as the formidable evidence he marshals to back it, I cannot entirely agree with them. <sssss> It seems that at least some scientific research involving animals is necessary for fighting many awful diseases and conditions which cause terrible human suffering. <sssss> I think a total ban on animal research, especially medical research and biotechnology research aimed at improving human health, is excessive. <sssss> Animals also form an essential part of the livelihood of many people around the world. <sssss> No doubt in many cases some practices lead to animals suffering, but does this mean all useage of animals in agriculture should be stopped? <sssss> Where do we make changes? <sssss> When do we make them? <sssss> I certainly agree agriculture should be done in such a way animal cruelty is removed, and suffering reduced as much as possible, but preventing all suffering is impossible, and reality will require compromise. <sssss> Also as another ecologist remarked, sometimes practices which cause harm to an individual animal is necessary to protect the overall ecosystem. <sssss> Hunting rabbits and kangeroos or cats or horses will cause suffering to these creatures, but is often a necessity in Australia where in many areas these animals are dangerous pests that ruin the native environment through overpopulation or hunting. <sssss> Still, the strongest thing in favour of Singer's thesis is that we do share a profound connection with nature, and our terrible disregard for the biosphere is coming back to haunt us in the form of mass extinctions of species. <sssss> We certainly need to redevelop a sense of what Edmund Wilson calls 'biophilia', a sense of affinity with nature and the natural world, rather than simply seeing it as another object to gratify our desires
M. T. Matoi "Gaijin"		Kokoro: Books: Natsume Soseki		2		This is a must read book. <sssss> Not just once, but many times. <sssss> Each time you read it you understand and see a different view of the book. <sssss> One needs to read this book from the Heart as the meaning of Kokoro means from the Heart. <sssss> The story of a married man, yet lonely. <sssss> Why he feels guilty about the death of his best friend. <sssss> A scholar with no ambition, rich enough to enjoy a few simple things in life. <sssss> How he talks about the ending of his own life. <sssss> He is sure his wife will be taken care of after his death. <sssss> The student is confused. <sssss> I am confused. <sssss> Read the book more than once. <sssss> Each time you read, put yourself in each characters "shoe". <sssss> Written with passion, Kokoro, from the Heart. <sssss> Is this book fiction or non-fiction, you decide
Erik Berg Backrow King		The Bridge of San Luis Rey (Perennial Classics): Books: Thornton Wilder		2		I came into this book expecting one thing. <sssss> After the first part, Perhaps an Accident, my expectations had completely altered. <sssss> As I read through the second part, Marquesa de Montemeyor, my expectations were slowly changing even more. <sssss> By the beginning of the third part, Esteban, my expectations had transformed so much they were hardly recognizable. <sssss> I came into it expecting a novel about a man of religion's struggle with faith. <sssss> By the first few pages I came to realize it had much more of a non-fiction lean, at this point I was scared of being bored. <sssss> As I started to read part two I began to realize it wasn't about this Brother Juniper at all but the people in the accident. <sssss> Throughout parts of the first chapter I have to admit I did feel bored, but near the end it caught fire and I was wowed by the first part's finish. <sssss> This reinvested my firm belief that the ending of a short story will completely redeem it, for that's what each part was: a short story telling the complete life of one of the victims in the accident of the bridge. <sssss> The story of Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize winner is that a bridge (the finest bridge in all of Peru) snapped and five travelers fell to their death. <sssss> Brother Jupiter decided to use this accident to prove that it was God's will. <sssss> This man found it more difficult than he expected discovering an ambiguity in life that he had not seen. <sssss> Basically the novel to me is detailing the complexity and mystery of life. <sssss> I would say the way The Bridge of San Luis Rey was written was, generally, not exceptionally appealing to me. <sssss> It was told almost exactly like a textbook account of the events. <sssss> Using this method though, there were dazzling moments when the book flowed like poetry. <sssss> The book also seemed slightly tedious at times. <sssss> Certain sections were difficult to get through but as I pressed on I felt a certain gratification, in knowing that I was being shown snapshots of life that were almost as real as they get. <sssss> Despite these downfalls (which had their upshots as well), the meaning of the book made it for me. <sssss> The characters were all taken on spiritual journeys and though each story ended in death, which was a death too early for all of them, there was a certain bittersweet happiness in their soulful accomplishments. <sssss> In total I would suggest the Bridge of San Luis Rey but only if you're willing to fully concentrate whenever you pick this book up. <sssss> It can be a beautiful book but only if first acknowledged as a tough book
Lovejoypeace! "Jesus is the answer."		DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION RECOGNIZING AND COPING WITH : Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from Childhood Through Adulthood: Books: Edward M. Hallowell,John J. Ratey		2		I bought my first copy of this book about two years ago. <sssss> Grabbed my brain and would not turn it loose...because the pages SCREAMED... "THIS IS YOU!". <sssss> I am now 51 years old, and have had the cross of ADHD ... or blessing... as you may see it all of my life. <sssss> I found myself picking up the phone to call close relatives and grabbing friends to lecture them on what was going on...mostly reading straight from the book. <sssss> My mother wondered if my father and older brother had ADHD. <sssss> Dad is dead now, but this can help me put some of the dysfunction in our relationship together. <sssss> Yes, I have been persecuted for having untreated, undiagnosed ADHD. <sssss> Yes, this book explained an awful lot to me, gave me real solutions, and encouraged me knowing that the two authors are also blessed / victims of this malady / mental enhancement! <sssss> I subsequently have bought copies for my aged mother in another state, and for my fiance. <sssss> I have to say, my fiance read it through and studied it like a how to manual for fixing me! <sssss> (She's a little scary, sometimes!) <sssss> And of course I sent a copy to my brother, the doctor, who has added it to his trusted library of resources and textbooks. <sssss> I am now on one of the medications for the neurotransmitter stimulus. <sssss> I have opted out of the antidepressants, because of their scary side effect warnings. <sssss> But the stimulant works to calm me and flush me with something I don't have without the medication. <sssss> It makes a difference. <sssss> I feel better and more confident, more able to concentrate and more up to meeting all the challenges of life. <sssss> What more can I say? <sssss> Their attention to all facets including proper medication and case history is fascinating, intriguing, and extremely useful. <sssss> Hope is out there
Angela L. Dairou		When the Body Says No: Understanding the Stress-Disease Connection: Books: Gabor Mat pppppppppp #233;,Gabor Mate		2		I disagree with the reviewer who said that this book does not offer solutions. <sssss> Again and again the author reports that people need to be heard, and need to stop repressing emotions to get well. <sssss> As a counselor working with battered women, I was amazed at the number of them who also had auto-immune disorders such as fibromyalgia. <sssss> This book is a must read
N. Gangahar		Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Adventures of a Curious Character): Books: Richard P. Feynman,Ralph Leighton,Edward Hutchings,Albert R. Hibbs		2		A really great book by a great man. <sssss> I almost laughed out loud while on a train and am sure people thought I was crazy. <sssss> The book made me wonder how can you lead such an interesting life and yet win a Nobel Prize in physics (I guess you can). <sssss> Though the book does not follow a chronological order , I could feel the earlier part corresponds to the youthful times in his life (If he ever got old). <sssss> Towards the later stages in the book I could also sense some cynicism in his words and he feels strongly about the lack of integrity, particularly in scientific research and life in general around him. <sssss> A wonderful book that gives some insight into a brilliant mind and inspires to think while learning and not just memorize facts.
J. K. Crockett		Life Without Bread: Books: Christian B. Allan,M.D. Wolfgang Lutz		2		I evolved into a lower carb nutrition by finding first that I needed more protein than I had thought and that I reacted strongly to sugars. <sssss> I bought this book when I decided to lose a few pounds, but wanted to understand any health implications related to a low carb diet. <sssss> I was already having gall bladder and liver issues. <sssss> I bought this book first and 2.5 years later, it is still the best reference I have. <sssss> The chapter on hormones is a bit technical, but this chapter alone is worth the price of the book. <sssss> Within three days of eliminating grains from my diet, I no longer cared whether or not I lost weight. <sssss> My awful blood sugar drops and painful bloating were gone, my energy increased significantly and within weeks I noticed that the gall bladder pain was gone (and it hasn't come back). <sssss> Within three months my intense hot flashes disappeared and I started sleeping better. <sssss> The book first describes what low carb nutrition is, then goes on to discuss hormones and how insulin impacts the overall balance of the body's hormones in different ways. <sssss> It addresses overall energy, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, vitamins and minerals, and weight control (one chapter - the rest is on health issues).
RRSII "Bobby"		Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War: Books: Michael Isikoff,David Corn		2		This is a great book. <sssss> I will not go into so much detail as the previous reviewers, but I must give credit where it is due. <sssss> Having read many books on the subject of the Bush White House including, "Fiasco," and "State of Denial," I did not think I would learn much more from this one. <sssss> I bought the book a few days ago, mainly because I like David Corn. <sssss> When I read it I was pleasantly surprised at how insightful it is. <sssss> I think along with the two books I mentioned earlier, this trio make up the essential reading on Bush, Iraq, and everything that can be encompassed in those broad categories. <sssss> If you could only read one, I would call it a dead heat between, "Hubris," and, "State of Denial." <sssss> If pressed I suppose I would have to give the edge to Hubris, as the writing was much less tedious I thought.
Frank D. Ferrara "frankieboy"		Art Of Chinese Swordsmanship: Manual Of Taiji Jian: Books: Zhang Yun		2		Wow! <sssss> This is a wonderful reference book not only for Taiji Jian (tai chi sword), but also for Taiji Quan. <sssss> All sections of the book are straight forward and easy to follow. <sssss> There wasn't any mystical pppppppppp quot;mumbo jumbo pppppppppp quot; I couldn't comprehend. <sssss> The first chapter which gives the reader information about the history of the Taiji jian, I particlularly liked this historical information. <sssss> Chapter two is for Taiji jian and Tai Chi Quan practitioners. <sssss> This chapter explains clearly the pppppppppp quot;ins and outs pppppppppp quot; of Taiji Quan and Taiji jian. <sssss> The author explains basic trainning, principles, elements, etc. <sssss> I found this section of great interest to me having only studied Taiji Quan for about a year now. <sssss> I believe the information I've gainned from reading this section will help improve my practice.I think advanced practitioners will find chapter two valuable as well. <sssss> The remaining chapters 3-8 give the reader information on the parts of the jian, how to practce with the jian, basic movements,fighting principles, and a 32 posture form with pictures and detailed explanations. <sssss> The explaination of each picture includes info about the key points, internal components and the movement itself. <sssss> This is a great manual that I know I will refer to over and over again. <sssss> This is a must read book for any Taiji Quan or Taiji jian practitioner
Betty Dravis "BettyDravis@sbcglobal.net, author of 1106 Grand Boulevard, The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley pppppppppp Millennium Babe: The Prophecy"		The Thorn Birds: Books: Colleen McCullough		2		I've read this book four times through the years since I first bought it. <sssss> The love between the two main characters, though a forbidden love, is so beautiful and magical it made me cry for Meggy and Father Ralph. <sssss> Not only is this an unforgettable love story, it's also a great education about sheep farming in Australia. <sssss> Magnificent description of a then harsh land. <sssss> The dialogue is believable, the characters so very real ... <sssss> I didn't simply read this book, I experienced it. <sssss> When the characters laughed, I laughed, and when they cried, my heart broke for them. <sssss> Poor little Meggy ... poor father Ralph. <sssss> How bittersweet and memorable. <sssss> I really can't get over the quality of this book and the sensitivity of the author. <sssss> Review by Betty Dravis, author of a new epic love story, 1106 GRAND BOULEVAR
bert livingston		The Physics of Immortality: Books: Frank J. Tipler		1		Tipler says many times "as I have proved". <sssss> Huh? <sssss> What the f is he talking about? <sssss> There is no proof in this stinking pile of filth. <sssss> He's got an abundance of physics in the back of the book-I'd like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense, but I don't think it should matter. <sssss> I am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts, and Tipler just doesn't make any sense. <sssss> His writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time. <sssss> The more books you read, the sooner you know when to stop reading, put the book down, and read a work of fiction instead, which can play with such ideas without boring you to death
peter		Gods and Generals: Books: Jeff Shaara		1		i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book, the killer angels. <sssss> it is not fair to compare the two, but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one, i thought i should mention it. <sssss> this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book. <sssss> it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg, so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle. <sssss> but the result is a less satisfying book. <sssss> it skims rather than digs deep
Dan		Deadly Feasts: Tracking the Secrets of a Terrifying New Plague: Books: Richard Rhodes		2		Deadly feasts: tracking the secrets of a terrifying new plague by Richard Rhodes is one scary book. <sssss> It tracks the discovery of prions, the mishapen proteins responsible for mad cow disease, scrapie, and Creutzfeldt Jacob disease. <sssss> Following human cannibals in the jungles of New Guinea in the fifties, bovine cannibals of the British Isles in the eighties, and the bizarre history of sheep scrapie from the 17th century on, Rhodes does a great job of presenting the history and discovery of this bizarre group of diseases. <sssss> I especially enjoyed the characterizations of the scientists, from the Noble Laureate who so enjoyed the New Guinea that he often regretted rejoining civiliziation, yet brought thirty natives back to the USA and helped them through school, to the hyper-competitive scientist who named the molecules even though he wasn't quite certain what they were. <sssss> But this isn't just a story of scientific discovery. <sssss> As the foreboding subtitle blares, Rhodes explores some of the scarier aspects of prions. <sssss> These include spontaneous formation, responsible for the known early cases of Creutzfeldt Jacob disease, trans-species infection, including mad cow disease and scrapie, the long long incubation period and lack of immune system response, and hardiness of the disease. <sssss> One scary factoid: a scientist took a sample of scrapie, froze it, baked it for an hour at 360 degrees (celsius), and was able to re-infect other animals from this sample. <sssss> For all the uneasiness this book inspires, it certainly doesn't offer any answers. <sssss> A condemnation of industrial agriculture, a warning that it's unknown whether vegetarians are even safe, and a caution against using bone meal for your flower garden do not make a recipe for handling this issue. <sssss> To be fair, it was printed in 1997--perhaps things are under control now.
Capitalizm		Communist Manifesto, The: Books: Karl Marx,Friedrich Engels,A. J. P. Taylor		1		Communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. <sssss> This book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. <sssss> Communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. <sssss> Some "intellectuals" actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, I don't know. <sssss> In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). <sssss> And the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. <sssss> Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding
VoodooLord7		Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained (The Signet Classic Poetry Series): Books: John Milton,Christopher Ricks,Susanne Woods		2		Add this reviewer to the list of people who hold Paradise Lost up to the lofty title of The Greatest Epic Poem in the English Language; it is not only this, but one of the best in any language. <sssss> Writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed Homeric epic verse, Mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by Homer, Virgil, and Dante -- but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work. <sssss> The opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by Homer, as are other elements, but Milton has a very unique poetic style; long sentences, often with the principle verb at the end, being one of its mainstays. <sssss> This language is very grandiose and quite complex; it takes a while to get used to it -- you will have to pay very close attention during the first book -- but, as with most classical literature, once the reader gets the hang of it, it goes quite smoothly. <sssss> The Divine Comedy of Dante has a more towring reputation than does Milton's Paradise Lost -- for one thing, it is older -- but I among those who find Milton to be superior. <sssss> The Divine Comedy is, certainly, an undisputed masterpiece, but, where it was, more or less, a satire and a thinly-veiled attack on many of Dante's political enemies, Milton's work deals with much more complex and profound subject matter: why mankind fell, how the gods themselves operate and think, the nature and attractiveness of evil and sin, the importance of love in human relationships, the moral problems of God's justice. <sssss> It is true that Dante's work is more original; Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained, at least in seed, come straight from The Bible. <sssss> But Milton only uses these stories as a springboard for the exploration of the latent moral and ethical problems lurking beneath. <sssss> Milton explores these problems with a refreshingly fresh perspective -- strictly within the Christian tradition, to be sure, but far from fundamentalist, and even quite radical for its day. <sssss> Although some cite the work as Christian apologist, there are certainly many elements within the poem that many of the more hard-line Christians would be taken aback by; it was, of course, even more controversial in its day. <sssss> One thing about the work that often gets pointed out is that Satan is a far more interesting and appealing character than God. <sssss> This, in my view, does not have Milton unwittingly on the Devil's side, as some critics have suggested. <sssss> Rather, he is pointing out how appealing sin is always is: of course it's interesting, of course it's appealing -- otherwise, we wouldn't keep falling for it again and again and again. <sssss> If we saw its razor-sharp fangs and [dripping] mouth, we would have stopped getting ensnared in its trap long ago. <sssss> However, as a non-Christian myself, I cannot but disagree with some points of Milton's theodicy; the last two books, in particular, and Paradise Regained as a whole, were, for me, quite hard to swallow. <sssss> I found the more human elements of the poem to be its most intriguing. <sssss> Milton paints Adam and Eve as quintissentially human characters who possess many of the same feelings that we all share: joy, happiness, fear, sadness, depression, and, most of all, the overriding paramount importance of love. <sssss> The act of Adam, who was not himself [evil], eating of the apple so that he could follow Eve, no matter what doom was to befall her and them, out of love for her, is still one of the most touching moments in all of literature -- as Mark Twain, in the voice of Adam, later said, "Wheresoever Eve was there, THERE was Eden." <sssss> God, Satan, and the various angels are also endowed with human characteristics; most Christians today seem to have forgotten that God created Man "in His own image", and that He is not a perfect creature. <sssss> Likewise, Satan is not entirely evil -- certainly he is ambitious and narcissistic, but so are many humans -- indeed, many have seen him as the hero of the poem (an errorenous view, as I see it.) <sssss> God often comes off as extremely cold and hardly forgiving or merciful; indeed, to many readers, myself included, this poem doesn't come anywhere near its stated goal of justifying the ways of Gods to men, but only reinforces the views we already had (Mark Twain, whom I have previously mentioned, has a very different view of the situation, closer to my own perspective, that is worth seeking out.) <sssss> Whatever one's objections to the theology and theodicy expressed within the poem, the poem remains a great work of literature -- poetic, grandiose, profound, extremely readable, and thought-provoking. <sssss> The shorter sequel, Paradise Regained, is also included in this edition. <sssss> This work, in my view, comes nowhere near the glory of it's predecessor, but it is still a good read and it is very handy to have it included in this volume as well. <sssss> For that reason, I highly reccommend picking up this particular edition of the works; also because the introduction, written by Dr. Susanne Woods, is very good, and it has notes provided by the wonderful Christoper Ricks, who also edited the poem for this version. <sssss> Unlike many editors, he does not include so many notes that they become cumbersome and distract from the text: they are genuinely helpful and there are not too many of them. <sssss> This is an absolute classic not only of English literature, but of world literature, and a monument in the tradition of epic poetry that you owe it to yourself to read
JB Kelly		How to Do Everything with Your iPAQ Pocket PC (How to Do Everything): Books: Derek Ball,Barry Shilmover		1		This book does a good job of telling you what your IPAQ can do but a very poor job of telling you how to do it. <sssss> I wanted more information about how to set up my IPAQ to connect with the internet. <sssss> The book told me it could be done and how wonderful it was, but lacked specific information about which screen to go to and how to actually make it work. <sssss> I later purchased IPAQ for Dummies. <sssss> This book told me what the IPAQ could do and specifically how to do it. <sssss> It was great. <sssss> The Dummies book also gave lots of information on programs that are very helpful to add to your IPAQ. <sssss> I was disappointed with IPAQ Pocket PC but very happy to get my hands on IPAQ for Dummies!
KnightofGod		Business Leaders and Success: 55 Top Business Leaders and How They Achieved Greatness: Books: Investor's Business Daily,William O'Neil		1		Simple arithmetic and you know it's stupid to expect much from a 227 content book that attempts to tell the success stories and forumlas of 55 business leaders. <sssss> Definitely everyone of them deserves its own biography instead of an average 4.13 pages. <sssss> So I had lowered my standard before I read it. <sssss> Still I had been quite disappointed. <sssss> All passages were columns published previously on IBD written by different reporters that not only the writing style but the focus on individual leaders fluctuated much between hard data/history and success formula, primarly on the former. <sssss> I am sorry that I could gain little knowledge/insight (that I really wanted to learn "how" they succeeded) during the reading. <sssss> I felt even worse after reading from the previous reviewer that the content had been available on the net. <sssss> In short, please give this book a pass!
"lovetophoto"		Fine Art Nature Photography: Advanced Techniques and the Creative Process: Books: Tony Sweet		2		Tony Sweet's photographs are breathtaking! <sssss> As you look at each photo and associated rationale for how and why he chose a particular exposure or composed it in a certain way, you realize the keen awareness he has of his environment and the obvious care and patience he places in his work. <sssss> I am so glad that he shares the technical side to his wonderful work. <sssss> I think photographers of all levels will have much to gain by reading and studying this book
Claire		Picture Perfect: Books: Jodi Picoult		2		My husband bought this book for me and I have to say it is not a book I would normally pick up. <sssss> I also have to say...I loved it! <sssss> It was a very entertaining story with several plot twists along the way. <sssss> I enjoyed the writing style and would highly recommend this book for taking on a relaxing trip this summer
M. Coffee		The Gourmet Cookbook: More Than 1000 Recipes: Books: Ruth Reichl,John Willoughby,Zanne Early Stewart		2		With over 1000 recipes, this cookbook is going to take some time to truly put through it's paces, but I've had great results with the few dishes I've tried so far. <sssss> The Turkey Wraps with Chipotle Mayo rocked, with a gem of a condiment included - pickled red onion. <sssss> I'd use that on any sandwich, anytime. <sssss> The sauces for Halibut with Spicy Asian Vinaigrette (really a sambal vinaigrette) and Wasabi Cream were awesome. <sssss> Veggie dishes like Asparagus with Shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners. <sssss> Granted, I haven't even put a dent in the vast amount of dishes represented in this massive cookbook - but so far so good! <sssss> I picked this up a few months agao as a remainder and paid about 10.00 for it - about a penny a recipe! <sssss> What a deal
2hotnaz "cwm"		Witness: For the Prosecution of Scott Peterson: Books: Amber Frey		1		Between the "Glamour Shots pppppppppp Easy Sex, Different Babys' Daddys" What else is there? <sssss> Oh yeah, the many scripture quotes pppppppppp abortion info. <sssss> Dont forget unprotected sex with every man she dates. <sssss> Dont forget letting a strange man pick your daughter up from school. <sssss> Poor Amber! <sssss> This gave me insight alright, on how dysfunctional Amber Frey is. <sssss> Shame on her for using Laci's photo! <sssss> I hope that she spends her profits on much needed therapy pppppppppp a Tubal Ligation!
A. Jessie "lovelyladykat"		Dorothy Parker: Books: Marion Meade		2		I am nearly finished with this book - I haven't been this mesmerized by a book in forever! <sssss> I would certainly recommend it
R. J. McCabe		Got Game: How the Gamer Generation Is Reshaping Business Forever: Books: John C. Beck,Mitchell Wade		1		First a little background... <sssss> I'm 53 with a preteen son. <sssss> I'm not quite a Luddite. <sssss> I make my living from an online business that I own and operate. <sssss> Our "big" present to our son last Xmas was a computer -- one he and I were going to build from scratch. <sssss> The main use of the computer was going to be video games and school work. <sssss> We gave our son a budget (not big by gamer PC standards) to shop for the parts. <sssss> I've read a few books recently on the gaming "culture" to better understand it. <sssss> This book came highly recommended from reviews here, so I read it. <sssss> My reaction to the book? <sssss> It took a while, but I finally realized it felt like I was reading a study paid for and prepared on behalf of the video game industry. <sssss> There are lots of great statistics, but rather flimsy rational defending extensive video game playing and how it's successfully preparing gamers to succeed in the future. <sssss> I did learn a few things. <sssss> I got a dose of reality about why it seems like everyone under 35 plays video games extensively. <sssss> I see that the *gamer generation* has a lot to offer. <sssss> I also seriously wonder about the gaps in what they have to offer. <sssss> A main thesis of the book is that gamers learn how to think and figure things out, because video games are about figuring out how to beat the game. <sssss> Interesting, since by the examples cited, it mostly appears to be trial and error with no significant logic involved. <sssss> I call it learn by trying anything, as opposed to learn by thinking. <sssss> Both have their place. <sssss> Supposedly, gamers are more willing to take (theoretically controlled) risks as well. <sssss> Somehow the authors see the dot.com boom (and bust) as an endorsement of the future of business in the hands of gamers (who largely ran the dot.coms). <sssss> I see a different story than the authors from those days of yore. <sssss> I could go on, but I think you get the point. <sssss> The book says little (nothing?) <sssss> about how video games are helping gamers learn math, science, or reading. <sssss> Personally, I believe those skills/knowledge are MUCH more important to a person's future than the ability to learn thru trial and error. <sssss> Maybe the conclusions of the authors will prove to be correct. <sssss> I hope so. <sssss> But personally, I'm concerned for any business that runs on the pure gamer mentality that I understand to be endorsed by the book.
Max P.		Accounting for Governmental and Nonprofit Entities with City of Smithville: Books: Earl R Wilson,Susan C. Kattelus,Jacqueline L. Reck		2		This book is a perfect trade off between simplified "for-dummies" type writing that simply acquaints you with the subject matter and a comprehensive text that thoroughly covers the subject. <sssss> If you are a CPA hopeful, a governmental finance professional or a political science graduate student this is the text for you. <sssss> Although layout and vocabulary could be simplified for improved readability, once you become familiar with the authors' style the reading is enjoyable.
Richard Paul Morris		The road to serfdom: Books: Friedrich A. von Hayek		2		Simply Awesome! <sssss> I keep having to stop the tape so it can sink in
Dr J. Scott "Scientist"		Modern VLSI Design: System-on-Chip Design (3rd Edition): Books: Wayne Wolf		1		After some years in the IC design business (mostly analog) I needed to teach a course on ASICSs. <sssss> This book was the text specified by my predecessor. <sssss> I did not like the book, and eventually read the Weste and Harris book in its 3rd edition. <sssss> Wolf is not nearly as clear, complete and logically organized as Weste and Harris - no comparison
Avid Reader		The Shroud of the Thwacker: Books: Chris Elliott,Chris Elliott		1		Yes, it was intended as a "fun" read (literature of the absurd?) <sssss> and it did evoke several chuckles, especially at the first. <sssss> But as literature (read into that word what you will) it's an abysmal failure. <sssss> Crammed with so many jokes, puns, outrageous and over the top dialogue and downright stupid action, one's interest is eventually diverted from the story to the catchy devices. <sssss> It's a case where you can't see the forest for all the intervening trees. <sssss> I had expected a "straight" tale similar to the Alienist. <sssss> Then when I discovered it was a humorous take on the police procedural I perked up. <sssss> It was only after the 100th hyperbole and cutesy 20th century reference that I grew weary of the whole thing. <sssss> Toward the end it descended into caricature. <sssss> What's sad is that the idea was a good one - maybe the author should stick to SNL and the visual media. <sssss> In fact, the book seemed very visual, almost as if the author were transcribing a SNL skit
upperleftcorner		Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary: Books: Simon Winchester		1		"This has been a story of an American soldier whose involvement in the making of the world's greatest dictionary was singular, astonishing, memorable and laudable - and yet at the same time wretchedly sad." <sssss> - Prologue. <sssss> Well, that certainly could have been the story. <sssss> But what it was was a history of the dictionary (as in "the history of the horse") with W.C. Minor's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so. <sssss> Winchester, the author of several other books I'll avoid, also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book. <sssss> So the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into...the history of insanity/dimentia/Alzeihmer's, whatever you want to call what Minor suffered. <sssss> Whereas I should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it wasn't a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85, I was fairly glad to see him go.
My Condolences		Tough Love: How Parents Can Deal With Drug Abuse: Books: Pauline Neff		1		The only thing this book is good for is getting high with your friends then reading the dialogue aloud. <sssss> The thought that anyone actually believes or takes the "situations" in this crap serious is so befuddling it's scary. <sssss> This is nothing more than propaganda for some strange religious cult. <sssss> I don't know about you but if I'm going to buy a book to help me with my kids it's going to be by an expert, not some failed fiction writer
Idiosyncrat "casillas8"		When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management: Books: Roger Lowenstein		1		I am by no means an economist, and much less an expert on finance, but this book strikes me as a thinly veiled, unsubtle hatchet job on the efficient markets hypothesis. <sssss> I've seen much subtler discussions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis written for general audiences, enough of them so I can recognize that Lowenstein doesn't get it; he equates efficient markets with "the price that the market offers is always the intrinsic value," and not with "you can't reliably predict intrinsic value any better than market prices themselves do." <sssss> This is a crucial difference, because it is only by assuming that market efficiency is the first that his attack holds water. <sssss> The other thing that makes me very suspicious about this book is the way Lowenstein presents the character of the various people involved in the story, given what his sources are. <sssss> Reading between the lines, I just have to wonder if his description of the personality and character of the people he describes as the core folks at LTCM is much too informed by interviews with people who've had a falling out with them
Gabrielle		The Undomestic Goddess: Books: Sophie Kinsella,Katherine Kellgren		1		Samantha seems a lot like Becky. <sssss> A young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions. <sssss> Instead of staying at the firm and working out her "mistake," she runs away. <sssss> This is just like Becky hiding her bills. <sssss> And then she gets a totally implausible job, because she can't tell the truth - again like Becky. <sssss> Samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to. <sssss> I agree that the firm would never have taken her back; they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care. <sssss> Samatha, like Becky at times, seems somewhat manic, in that she's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation. <sssss> just like Becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared. <sssss> Lithium, anyone? <sssss> I don't have an opinion on the housewife/lawyer "controversy," but I do think Kinsella's protagonists need to grow up
William Talbey		Accident: Books: Danielle Steel		2		I loved this story. <sssss> It was written in true steel fashion...exciting, interesting, and fullfilling
Michael Sutcliffe		Adam of the Road: Books: Elizabeth Janet Gray,Robert Lawson		1		I recently read this as part of a survey of childrens' literature about the Medieval period. <sssss> Let me say first, that the dialogue is completely modernized, with not even a complex word to redeem it. <sssss> I know this is because the original is supposedly in dialect, but please, our children are more sophisticated than that. <sssss> Adam is self-involved, careless, and annoyingly stupid. <sssss> Despite it's touted 320 pages, this could have been printed in 150, and contained much the same material. <sssss> The only thing that redeems this novel from being totally forgettable is the snatches of Latin and Old English ballads scattered throughout. <sssss> If you want your children to have a much clearer understanding of the times, with a book focussed more on character than on plot or modern accessability, have them read Song of the Gargoyle. <sssss> It's also about a boy who loses his father, and has to search for him, in the company of a dog-like being, but has ten times the depth and realism of this piece of trash. <sssss> The boy is also a minstrel, of sorts, but he has more likable qualities than Adam, as well as more adventures in less pages. <sssss> The ending is a happy one, but it involves a twist, which isn't at all forseeable, as theat in Adam of the Road. <sssss> Please, just skip this, I don't care if it won a Newberry Award, and read Song of the Gargoyle, by Zylpha Keatly Snider
gwendolyn f reyes		Cooking for Dummies: Books: Bryan Miller,Marie Rama		2		My sister, whom moved out and had never cooked a thing in her life, really enjoyed the benefits from this book! <sssss> The moment she saw it on my shelf, she snatched it up and took it home and I haven't seen it since. <sssss> I hear she's cooking some great meals and hope she'll invite me over for dinner sometime soon! <sssss> ;
another reader "another reader"		Feminist Accused of Sexual Harassment (Public Planet Books): Books: Jane Gallop		1		For decades, many male professors have made the same excuses for sexual exploitation of their students--to the fury of feminists. <sssss> To read a feminist using the same rationalizations is both nauseating and infuriating
C. Lui "CLui"		Look Homeward, Angel: Books: Thomas Wolfe		1		I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through). <sssss> It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere. <sssss> I do not recommend this book
SHIV SHAKTI "Nigel"		Misery, Spanish Edition: Books: Stephen King		2		Paul Sheldon,a very good writer famous for his books in the "Misery" series.A popular character in his book is someone named Misery.In his final book he kills the character off,therby ending the series.Paul's number one fan is Annie Wilkes,a retired nurse. <sssss> (I would like to say,retarded). <sssss> One day Paul gets into an accident and gets both of his legs severely damaged.Coincidently,Guess who finds him? <sssss> Annie.Yes,she finds him and starts to nurse him back to good health.But when she soon finds out that Paul has killed the character "Misery",Annie is pissed...She makes it her business to get Paul to write another novel in which "Misery" is not killed.It sounds simple,I know.But when Paul refuses to write the novel,Annie uses force,and she tortures him so much that he just gives in and begins to write a new novel. <sssss> Meanwhile thinking of a way to escape,Paul writes the novel and suffers at the same time.He lost one of his foot,because she burnt it off!Yes,this Annie Wilkes is a lunatic.While Paul is under Annie's capture,he learns alot about things he took for granted.The ending of this book is a happy one,you won't be disappointed.I recommend this book as any other SK novel.It is a great Suspense,drama novel...enjoy...Nigel Here is another version of the plot. <sssss> (taken from wikipedia)... "The story begins with Paul Sheldon slowly waking out of a coma. <sssss> Gradually, his memory returns to him: he is a wildly popular romance novelist of the Misery series of novels (the main character of which is named Misery Chastain) who has crashed his car in a winter storm outside of Silver Creek in Grand County, Colorado, and has been badly injured. <sssss> His rescuer, Annie Wilkes, is a former registered nurse and has taken him to her secluded country home to personally care for him. <sssss> As luck would have it, Annie is Paul's "number one fan" and eagerly awaited all his publications. <sssss> Almost immediately however, Paul realizes that there is a flip side to this coin: Annie is mentally ill, she has not told anyone where he is, and she has a violent past that includes a successful career as a serial killer. <sssss> Annie begins to physically and psychologically abuse Paul when she finishes reading his latest published work, in which the heroine Misery dies. <sssss> Annie later forces him to burn an unpublished manuscript of his new novel, "Fast Cars" he was carrying at the time of his accident, disgusted at its radical departure from the Misery series. <sssss> Eventually, Annie forces Paul to write a new Misery novel "just for her" and bring the character back from the dead. <sssss> Paul works on the book as Annie's violent mood swings and her psychosis deepens. <sssss> Her insanity escalates as Paul tries to escape; she eventually chops off one of Paul's feet, one of his thumbs, and murders a police officer investigating his disappearance. <sssss> As the authorities begin to close in on Annie, Paul's plight--both in his writing and his attempt to save his life--becomes more desperate. <sssss> Paul eventually defeats Annie by smashing her over the head with the second hand typewriter she had given him to write "her" novel. <sssss> After he escapes, he publishes the new Misery novel to great critical acclaim. <sssss> "...enjoy...Nigel
M. T. Meaney		I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America After Twenty Years: Books: Bill Bryson		1		I keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are, but I have never found this to be so. <sssss> He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it. <sssss> He seems more at home studying statistics (which he includes everywhere) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics. <sssss> I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper, surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world. <sssss> All his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later. <sssss> Still lots of people think he is grea
rodboomboom		Elegantly Easy Creme Brulee : pppppppppp Other Custard Desserts: Books: Debbie Puente		2		All kinds of creme brulees. <sssss> This is an outstanding cookbook on a one style of dessert and has many varieties and helps and serving suggestions. <sssss> Favorite is the chocolate box presentation suggestion. <sssss> Everyone seems to go for creme brulee
The Apostate		Holy Blood, Holy Grail: Books: Michael Baigent,Richard Leigh,Henry Lincoln		1		This is the book Dan Brown's bestseller "The Da Vinci Code" is based on. <sssss> Indeed, Michael Baigent et.al. <sssss> have even sued Brown in court, charging him with plagiarizing their book. <sssss> The ideas behind "The Da Vinci Code" have been exposed as completely bogus by many real historians. <sssss> Obviously, this exposure affects "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" as well. <sssss> This book is methodologically flawed. <sssss> It claims that Jesus survived the crucifixion and sired children with Mary Magdalene. <sssss> But if this happened, there should be ancient documents telling us about it. <sssss> There are essentialy only three ancient views of Jesus: the Christian, the Judeo-Christian and the Gnostic. <sssss> None of them includes the notion that Jesus married and had children with Mary Magdalene. <sssss> It simply isn't serious to reject the ancient documents in favor of modern texts of questionable value, as Michael Baigent does. <sssss> Of course, a conspiracy theorist might claim that the ancient documentation is lacking due to a massive cover-up. <sssss> But such an argument, compelling as it may sound, is worthless to the historian, who must work with the real evidence, meager as it may be. <sssss> A claim that can neither be proven or disproven is of little help. <sssss> Besides, how many sects or cults have managed to keep their esoteric secrets? <sssss> Very few indeed. <sssss> There is always a defector or infiltrator somewhere. <sssss> The idea that the biggest secret of all times was revealed by a confused French right-wing extremist only 40 years ago is very hard to take seriously. <sssss> Indeed, the fact that not even heretical groups like the Gnostiscs claimed that Jesus had sired children, is good evidence against the claim. <sssss> The Gnostics, after all, made all kinds of peculiar statements. <sssss> But not this one. <sssss> Why? <sssss> Why are books like "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" and "The Da Vinci Code" so popular? <sssss> Perhaps they say what many people want to hear. <sssss> That in itself is somewhat damning, I think. <sssss> For how many people want to hear the truth?
Laura Eakes		The Seducer (Get Connected Romances): Books: Madeline Hunter		1		I was looking forward to reading this book, first in a series. <sssss> Sadly, I gave up on it about 100 pages in. <sssss> I felt there was so MUCH mundane writing and hardly any dialog between not only the two main characters but between any characters at all. <sssss> It just feels completely unemotional and without any sort of feeling-there is NOTHING exciting about this book. <sssss> The heroine is naive, and not in a good way. <sssss> I hope the others in this series are better. <sssss> 1.5 stars
hedge fund king		Investments (McGraw-Hill/Irwin Series in Finance, Insurance, and Real Est): Books: Zvi Bodie,Alex Kane,Alan J. Marcus		2		Great book! <sssss> It's comprehensive and easy to understand. <sssss> Highly recommended textbook.
660 magnum "SNB"		The Mark: The Beast Rules the World (Left Behind, 8): Books: Tim F. LaHaye,Jerry B. Jenkins,Frank Muller		1		This is a kids book. <sssss> First few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book.
Will Murphy		Rights of Man (Penguin Classics): Books: Thomas Paine,Henry Collins,Eric Foner		1		This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today. <sssss> Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading. <sssss> Regardless, the second part, the chapter on pppppppppp quot;Ways and Means pppppppppp quot; in particular, is composed of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find. <sssss> What Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state, replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other fine statist amenities. <sssss> Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing whatsoever. <sssss> It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring legacy as a friend to liberty. <sssss> In truth, he is actually one of its worst enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression, revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy
Thomas Vaughan		Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning: Books: David E. Goldberg		1		I agree with another reviewer who said the book was unnecessarily long. <sssss> Genetic Algorithms are a great programming tool, and there are some tips and tricks that can help your programs converge faster and more accurately, but this book had a lot of redundant information. <sssss> If you are interested in using GA for solution-finding, I doubt you'll find much useful in this book beyond the first chapter or so. <sssss> Many of the examples later in the book were so specific that I couldn't see how they could be usefully generalized. <sssss> Really optimizing a GA approach for a specific problem domain takes a fair amount of tuning, and this book won't help much with that. <sssss> I think time spent surfing siteseer or other publication sites would be better spent than reading this book.
Marshill		9-11: Books: Noam Chomsky		1		The religion of peace is at it again! <sssss> In response to the popes words, muslims all over the world respond with violence, destruction, rage, hatred, burning down buildings, burning papal effigies, issuing fatwas against the pope, and even shooting a 70 year old nun in the back. <sssss> Wow, such peace from a religion of "peace". <sssss> If Islam is a religion of peace, then all the guns in the world are pink flowers, and every nuclear bomb, a soft feathery pillow. <sssss> Violence for words. <sssss> Destruction for speech. <sssss> PLEASE! <sssss> This is a religion of war, and bereft mindless 70 year old bags like Noam have begun to lose a lot of mental function with age. <sssss> This old bag of a man gives Muslims free passes and blames America. <sssss> Question: When will the world start holding to account the actions of Muslims, and stop blaming others, such as Bush, America, the Pope, or God knows who else? <sssss> How many more innocent people will die at the hand of Muslims before the western world finally, and for the first time, holds the Muslims accountable for their own actions, rather than someone else? <sssss> Well Im sick of the left defending this vile cesspool of Islamofacism. <sssss> Im tired of the leftist media beating up on Israel and coming to the side of middle-eastern tyrants who shoot 70 year old nuns in the back in response to spoken words. <sssss> And then these radical leftists have the audacity blame the pope! <sssss> Can you believe it?!! <sssss> Yes, idiots all over the western world actually blame the pope for the mindless violence and destruction that followed from a spoken word. <sssss> Its unreal! <sssss> A grown man got a gun, deliberately aimed it at a 70 year old woman's backside, and deliberately pulled the trigger, purposefully killing her in cold blood....and yet according to socialist America-hating leftists, he couldn't help it. <sssss> Its not his fault...its the Pope's fault guys! <sssss> Respond to words with violence, and then blame the speaker, absolving the person who actually commits the violence of responsibility. <sssss> As absurd as that sounds, I'm sad to say there are actually people all over the world who think that. <sssss> And they are idiots (like Noam)
Anthony Martel		Why Christianity Must Change or Die: A Bishop Speaks to Believers In Exile: Books: John Shelby Spong		1		To say Christianity will die is to say that one can see the end of the world. <sssss> Purely craziness. <sssss> Christianity will live as long as the world exists. <sssss> What is died is the faith for many Christians, what has been changed is our faith (by money, pride, and selfishness) and consequently, our church and our societies. <sssss> What dominants many US and European Christian churches is a worldly Christianity, a Christianity affected by the materialism, and world-view. <sssss> The exact thing that Jesus repeatedly condamned. <sssss> I feel extremely sad when I can see pasters and evangelists earn 6-figure salaries, live in luxury houses, air-travel in business class, or socialize with social elite. <sssss> I feel extremely sad when I see young theology students without born-again experience and spiritual life become pasters and preasts. <sssss> Jesus have given us great mission: to preach gospel to every corner in the world. <sssss> But money, pride, and selfishness have consumed the hearts and sole of many Christians and today they love the world more than they love Jesus. <sssss> Are they still Christians? <sssss> Of course not. <sssss> To say Christianity needs change is purely nonesense. <sssss> Only person see himself greater than Jesus would say something like that. <sssss> What needs to be changed is ourselves, not Christianity. <sssss> Because we have embaked a wrong way, following the world and not following Jesus.
M. Little		The Peace Book: Books: Todd Parr		2		Pretty much all of the Todd Parr books we've read are great but the "Peace Book" and the "Family Book" are by far our favorites. <sssss> They are very positive and carry a theme of tolerance. <sssss> We'd highly recommend this book!
Sophie Williams		Born in Fire (Born In Trilogy): Books: Nora Roberts,Fiacre Douglas		2		The first book in NR's 'Born In' series is wonderful, you don't want to miss it! <sssss> pppppppppp quot;Born In Fire pppppppppp quot; focuses on Maggie Concannon, a tempermental and loyal woman who is also a gifted artist. <sssss> Gallery owner Rogan Sweeney takes an interest in Maggie's fabulous glass creations, and soon after takes a personal interest in Maggie herself. <sssss> Maggie is a wonderful character, stubborn and flawed, yet still caring. <sssss> Nora does a fabulous job of developing Maggie, and does it in a way that she seems like a real person. <sssss> Rogan is an extremely likeable hero. <sssss> Maggie's sister, Brianna, is her complete opposite; quiet, sweet, and calm. <sssss> The relationship between the two sisters, however, is very touching and very real. <sssss> This book is full of colourful characters, some we love and some we hate. <sssss> The romance between Rogan and Maggie is wonderful. <sssss> Basically, I just can't say enough good things about this book. <sssss> You will love it
P. Rueda		The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression: Books: Andrew Solomon		2		In 2003 I suffered my worst major depression ever. <sssss> It lasted for over a year, and in the worst moments -which lasted months- my anguish was so intense that I wished I were dead. <sssss> Again, the worst part was when I couldn't even get a full night's rest, and after just two or three hours of sleep would wake up at 2 or 3 a.m. full of despair, unable to even pray or meditate or get any kind of relief, and anguished at the prospect of the new day approaching... Having to get up in the morning was hell. <sssss> Needless to say I couldn't work, and that increased my ill-feelings and my guilt at seeing how my wife had to shoulder the full responsibility in our family of four (we have two adolescent kids). <sssss> Reading Andrew Solomon's book, which I found recommended at depression-blog at blogspot dot com was an extraordinary experience, because for the first time ever I found my own reflected on the written page by a gifted writer who has also suffered the extreme anguish and pain of major depression. <sssss> In my illness, I found that psychiatrists, doctors and other therapists who haven't themselves gone through the hellish nightmare of a major depression simply cannot understand what it is like. <sssss> It's just like what happens with someone who has never eaten an orange: no matter how much you you try to explain how it tastes, the other person will have no real understanding unless he/she eats one him/herself. <sssss> Same with friends and well-wishers of many sorts, who will tell you things like "Cheer up!" <sssss> or "Make an effort!" <sssss> without realizing that that's precisely what you would most want to do -but can't. <sssss> Solomon's book and the advise of Mike S. -now a friend, and the guy who created the depression-blog at blogspot dot com- have been of great value to me. <sssss> And of course the courage and love of my wife, who never -even in the worst moments, when we both thought I might die at any moment- abandoned hope, sustaining me, putting up with a lot, holding me when I cried in utmost despair and wished I were dead as the only relief in the midst of what now I recall as the worst kind of torture a human being can be subjected to... And my kids, too, who at times even made me laugh with a joke or helped me get some sleep with a massage. <sssss> And God, who in the midst of utter darkness and despair, was there too, and saw me through
John J Whyte		The Gay Metropolis: 1940-1996: Books: Charles Kaiser		2		This book provides the reader with a clear, basic understandingof the grounding of popular opinion regarding gay life during the last50 years. <sssss> While the history is too rich and detailed to be dealt within a book with this scope, this is a remarkably readable and valuable thumbnail of the currents of the public discourse on gay life, and should provide any reader with an understanding of how crucial and new gay civil rights really are. <sssss> I only hope that it will inspire others whose experience of being gay is a relatively new one to realize how important political activism and community still is. <sssss> Not only that, a very engaging read
sandalista		When Character Was King: A Story of Ronald Reagan: Books: Peggy Noonan		2		Peggy Noonan's Reagan has the texture of truth, unlike a recent Reagan bio by Richard Reeves that has the texture of slime. <sssss> Noonan's Reagan is not hagiography; it's clear-eyed, clean, and palpably honest. <sssss> I feel Ms. Noonan's honesty just as I felt the incredible lightness of Reeves' shallowness. <sssss> Noonan wrote her story of a great man and the building of his character as Ronald Reagan lay dying. <sssss> Now that he's gone, Peggy Noonan is our era's great communicator. <sssss> Not every word of When Character Was King is the utterly necessary word at the absolutely necessary time -- a few of her words don't fit and an occasional fact is flubbed -- but all other words of hundreds and thousands fit perfectly into the best portrait we have of a good and great man, a description also used fittingly for Dwight Eisenhower. <sssss> Noonan, I believe, is the only biographer of President Reagan who understands the import of a first-term footnote, an episode that most of the world has learned to forget or, like Reeves, has learned to diminish. <sssss> That's the PATCO strike which, as Noonan shows, had world-historical implications. <sssss> By the force of his focus, President Reagan used PATCO to reassert free-world mastery in our twilight struggle with an Evil Empire that was evil and that was an empire. <sssss> Thank God we had Reagan at a moment of maximum danger. <sssss> Thank God he had Noonan to tell his story
Jennifer L. Berger "malleron"		Authorware 6 (Inside Macromedia): Books: Scott J Wilson,Jennie Thornton		2		For someone totally unfamiliar with Authorware, I thought this book rather confusing. <sssss> I typically learn best by playing with software and using the manual to construct my own exercises. <sssss> However, I knew Authorware was pretty complex so I thought this book would help. <sssss> Well, it did help a little but overall I became quite frustrated with following the book's exercises. <sssss> As I use Authorware I imagine I'll keep this book on my desk as a reference tool. <sssss> But until then, I'll content myself with playing on my own
Monica G. "Monica G."		Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing: Books: Christiane Md Northrup		1		Dr. Northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies, stages of life and medical procedures. <sssss> However, I was appalled by her bias against Western cultural heritage and Christianity. <sssss> Her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced, with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women. <sssss> As a Catholic whose best teachers were strong-minded, compassionate religious sisters, I felt offended by her slur against nuns. <sssss> I am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing, but I would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research.
Jimmy		How to Be Alone: Books: Jonathan Franzen		1		I read a good short story by Franzen in The New Yorker a couple years ago, but this book is lame, lame, lame. <sssss> The essays contain little to no humor or insight- they are just lengthy, boring opinions on various subjects. <sssss> Imagine if you can a duller, less-relavant Andy Rooney. <sssss> If I wanted to read some loser's uninspired musings, I would get on the internet and start reading weblogs. <sssss> I hereby declare this book Unreadable
R. Toney		The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (Oprah's Book Club): Books: Carson McCullers		1		Please take the time to consider what kind of reader you are. <sssss> I hated this book. <sssss> It took me at least 6 months to read this because I could not force myself to read it. <sssss> But that being said I also hate stream of consciousness and now wished that I had looked at some reviews and realized that was what I was getting myself into. <sssss> I read 'As I Lay Dying' in High School and hated it too. <sssss> There is no plot, and no point. <sssss> I hated it.
		The Spooky Art: Some Thoughts on Writing: Books: Norman Mailer		1		Mailer tells us a lot we don't want to know about. <sssss> It's the gloomy long tale of an egocentric writer's acceptance of the ups and downs of his metier. <sssss> He gives his biased opinions on things he knows and things he doesn't know about. <sssss> All the negative aspects of his persona are laid out. <sssss> Still, it must have taken some bravery to lay out some of them. <sssss> Or else he needed the money. <sssss> Truth sells, even if it is a very mediocre unfocused book, and quite un-useful. <sssss> It should have been titled pppppppppp quot;Me and My Books, Some thoughts on me and my writing pppppppppp quot;
Tiffany Holley "Christian mom"		Hand, Hand, Fingers, Thumb (Bright pppppppppp Early Board Books(TM)): Books: Al Perkins,Eric Gurney		1		This is a nice enough board book, but be advised that it is NOT the full version of Dr. Seuss' book! <sssss> They've left out several (charming!) <sssss> pages of text and illustrations for the Board Book... What a disappointment to loyal fans, and how unfair to the newest generation of fans-to-be
R. Fryer "Digital Logic is Fun"		Unnatural Exposure: Books: Patricia Cornwell		1		Then you'll probably like this story. <sssss> My wife and I read books together and I'd sworn off Cornwell after Hornet's Nest (which on TV Cornwell admitted was some warmed over college material - and it showed horribly). <sssss> The Scarpetta character (in some books) is unbelievably emotionally ultra-hyper (going from confident to terrified every time Marino knocks on the door). <sssss> In this book she was mercifully level headed almost ALL the time! <sssss> What a relief. <sssss> And there was a real story. <sssss> I'm not really a fan of her work over the last 10 years but there's almost enough lab details here to satisfy. <sssss> Sure wish she (Scarpetta) would learn to delegate - imagine the top lab expert for her state and she has to go to every crime scene and move bodies herself! <sssss> Anyway don't start here with the Scarpetta series - but if you already like the character, this one is a B+. <sssss> Compared to other crime novels in general, it's still a C- in my estimation
E. Malmberg		Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History: Books: Erik Larson,Edward Herrmann		2		I listened to Isaac's Storm on CD while painting a room, and it made the time fly! <sssss> The CD rendition was clearly spoken and had excellent production value. <sssss> That said, I also loved the story. <sssss> I am a weather-hound, and I enjoyed the detail of the way in which the nation maintained it's weather bureau. <sssss> (I had recently read "The Children's Blizzard" and I would consider this as a nice companion book for we weather-hounds.) <sssss> The descriptions from survivors was threaded effectively along with a panoramic view of the Galveston tragedy. <sssss> I have not read the book, but I found the CD riveting.
W. D. Amato "Drumturtle"		Endangered Species (Anna Pigeon Mysteries (Paperback)): Books: Nevada Barr		1		This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down. <sssss> It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest. <sssss> There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime. <sssss> There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable. <sssss> I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction. <sssss> Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead.
A. F. Harned		The Sinister Pig: Books: Tony Hillerman		2		Have read the whole Leaphorn/Chee series by Tony Hillerman. <sssss> This is one of the better ones - the subject is topical and the characters take on more definition. <sssss> The overall "feel" is that this time, the subject is of a more personal nature to Tony Hillerman? <sssss> A good read
Kelly "kitten0601"		Abnormal Psychology and Modern Life: Books: Robert C. Carson		1		This is a great book if you have the right teacher. <sssss> The book is very informative yet if you have no back ground in abnormal psych you might want to make sure the teacher for your course is capable of explaining it to you. <sssss> I also recomend that you make sure your copy has a CD rom. <sssss> The study guide and website are great tools too. <sssss> They help a lot
Rennie Petersen		The Man in the Black Suit : 4 Dark Tales: Books: Stephen King,John Cullum,Peter Gerety,Betty Ann Baker		2		First, a few words about each of the four different stories. <sssss> "The Man in the Black Suit" - 3 stars This is a story about a 9-year-old boy who meets the Devil himself. <sssss> It's a very scary experience for the boy, especially because his older brother died the year before and now the Devil tells him that his mother has just died in the same way. <sssss> This is the weakest of the four stories because the Devil, although being scary, doesn't really come across as a serious threat. <sssss> What kind of second-rate Devil is it that can't even catch a boy who decides to run away from him? <sssss> In "Everything's Eventual" Stephen King writes that this story won a prestigious "best short story" award in 1996, much to his surprise. <sssss> That surprises me too, because in my opinion this story is not that great. <sssss> "All That You Love Will Be Carried Away" - 5 stars This is the shortest story (only 35 minutes) and one of the two best ones in this collection. <sssss> Alfie Zimmer is a traveling salesman in the American Midwest. <sssss> He has an amazing hobby and he's tired of life. <sssss> But if he commits suicide, what will everyone think of his hobby? <sssss> What makes this story so good are the very detailed and evocative descriptions of the conditions under which a traveling salesman lives. <sssss> Alfie's strange hobby is also captivating, as are the descriptions of the landscape and isolated towns in the bleak and barren Midwest. <sssss> In "Everything's Eventual" Stephen King admits that Alfie's strange hobby was actually something he did himself! <sssss> "The Death of Jack Hamilton" - 4 stars This is a very unusual story for Stephen King. <sssss> It tells a "mythical" story about the 1934 death of Jack Hamilton, member of the John Dillinger gang. <sssss> Homer Van Meter, another gang member, purportedly tells the story. <sssss> John Dillinger, Jack Hamilton and Homer Van Meter were all real people. <sssss> You can find a lot of interesting background information about them by doing an Internet search for John Dillinger. <sssss> Despite the fact that these were all ruthless gangsters we find ourselves sympathizing with them. <sssss> Stephen King's approach to the story is that gangsters are also human beings. <sssss> The slow death of Jack Hamilton and the efforts of John Dillinger to get him medical help and Dillinger's distress as Jack Hamilton's condition worsens are powerful images. <sssss> "That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French" - 5 stars This is the best story in the collection. <sssss> Carol was brought up as a strict Catholic, but then, during the first years of her marriage to Bill, she had an abortion. <sssss> Now she and Bill are supposed to be celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary and Carol is being subjected to a horrendous punishment for what she did. <sssss> What makes the story fascinating is that it is not God who is punishing Carol. <sssss> No, it is Carol, under the influence of her Catholic upbringing, who has prescribed her own punishment. <sssss> And this punishment Carol is inflicting on herself is much worse than a benevolent God would come up with, even assuming that God considers what Carol did to be wrong. <sssss> In summary, two very good stories, one good one, and one that's just OK. <sssss> The four stories are read by four different professional readers. <sssss> The total running time is approx. <sssss> 3 hours 40 minutes, not 4 hours as specified on the packaging. <sssss> All four of these stories are included in the book "Everything's Eventual", along with 10 other short stories by Stephen King. <sssss> If you want to save money or if you dislike audio books then "Everything's Eventual" is a better deal. <sssss> Rennie Peterse
B. Bryant "be7701"		The Catholic Youth Bible New Revised Standard Version: Pray It, Study It, Live It: Books: Brian Singer-Towns		2		This Bible blew me away when I went hunting for one a few months ago to give to a youth who had come into my life. <sssss> I was so impressed, I bought one for myself. <sssss> This Bible is many things, but the first thing that I noticed, quite honestly, is that the colors were bright, the print readable, and the illustrations far less serious and far more engaging than your typical Bible. <sssss> Without growing to an unwieldy size, the editors manage to throw in a wealth of study information, written in a modern, friendly style, that helps make even the dryest or most confusing parts of the Good Book both understandable and relevant to today's society. <sssss> That is what makes it perfect for someone, like my young friend, who is unfamiliar with religion, Christianity, or just plain old Bible study. <sssss> It's less intimidating that most Bibles and all material is presented in such a manner that you don't feel "unprepared" if you pick it up cold. <sssss> Catholics are often les familiar with the Bible than many Protestant denominations, as we have a wholistic focus that is both valuable and worthwhile--however, a better relationship and understanding of the Word can only enhance one's spiritual life and experience as a Catholic. <sssss> If that applies to you (which, I have to admit, it did to me) this is a wonderful way to get your feet wet in Biblical translation, discussion, interpretation, and modern relevance. <sssss> Who won't like this Bible? <sssss> 1 - Those more familiar and attached to more formal translations such as the King James Version 2 - Those already familiar with intensive Bible study, IF not working with youth or those less familiar 3 - most Protestants...the discussion is from a very clear Catholic viewpoint...not really controversial, just Catholic 4 - and traditionalists who are offended by the idea of making the Bible "accessible" and "relevant" through use of the lingo/parlance and point of view of today's under-25 set. <sssss> I believe one reviewer felt that the Bible didn't need to be made culturally relevant, finding the sidebars on race, cultural differences, modern morality, and varying interpretations to be just another extension of the "Political Correctness" movement. <sssss> I couldn't disagree more. <sssss> The Bible should be the one book that everyone can "see themselves" in should they seek such a thing. <sssss> This Bible does that for a new generation of Catholics and for a new, hesitant group of explorers. <sssss> I'd ballpark the appropriate age for this version at around 13-35 years
Josh Kalish		The Communist Manifesto: Books: Karl Marx,Friedrich Engels,Martin Malia		1		When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with. <sssss> I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people. <sssss> But that is what hate litterature does. <sssss> This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate
Bruce Kodish		PI in the Sky: Counting, Thinking, and Being: Books: John D. Barrow		2		Barrow, an astronomer at the University of Sussex when this book was published, provides an entertaining and informative account of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics. <sssss> Do mathematicians invent or discover mathematics? <sssss> What 'reality' do mathematical entities like pi have? <sssss> What accounts for what physicist Eugene Wigner has called, in a now-famous paper, pppppppppp quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences pppppppppp quot; (299)? <sssss> After an interesting account of the history of counting and numbers, Barrow discusses in succeeding chapters the philosophies of formalism, inventionism, intuitionism, and platonism, a sophisticated version of which he seems to favor. <sssss> Perhaps most mathematical workers follow what Alfred Korzybski called pppppppppp quot;the 'christian science' school of mathematics, which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely any problems of the epistemological foundations of its supposed `scientific' activities pppppppppp quot; (Science and Sanity 748). <sssss> I commend Barrow because he considers these epistemological questions important and writes about them so engagingly. <sssss> Barrow's discussions of theories and personalities provide useful background for understanding mathematical foundations. <sssss> As for Barrow's conclusions, from a non-aristotelian view, the appeal of platonism seems understandable as an example of identification, the confusion of orders of abstracting. <sssss> Barrow doesn't seem to consider that mathematicians may both invent and discover mathematics. <sssss> He seems so taken with the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences that the notion of mathematical entities existing solely as high-order abstractions in human nervous systems seems insufficient to him. <sssss> As Korzybski pointed out, we live in a world of multi-dimensional, ordered structures or relations. <sssss> It does not seem unreasonable, then, that we can map this world with an exact language of relations, i.e., mathematics. <sssss> But as Korzybski also pointed out many times, pppppppppp quot;the map is not the territory. <sssss> pppppppppp quot
Sarah K. Levy		Fork It Over: The Intrepid Adventures of a Professional Eater: Books: Alan Richman		2		What fun! <sssss> This hilarious book is filled with Richman's amusing culinary observations and adventures during his long and impressive career as GQ's food, wine and restaurant critic. <sssss> It is the perfect winter read and holiday gift. <sssss> It is witty, engaging and even touching at times. <sssss> My mother said it was the only thing that made her laugh out loud during her double knee replacement rehab! <sssss> I am giving this book to all my friends this year.
Tom Sato "Tom"		Islam Unveiled: Disturbing Questions About the World's Fastest Growing Faith: Books: Robert Spencer,David Pryce-Jones		1		[Joshua 6:23,21]Joshua said to the people of Israel, "The Lord has given you the city of the all silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the Lord: They shall come into the treasury of the Lord. <sssss> The people utterly DESTROYED ALL THAT WAS IN THE CITY, BOTH MAN AND WOMAN,YOUNG AND OLD, AND OX AND SHEEP, AND ASS, WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD. <sssss> Deuteronomy 17:3-5 "And he should go and worship other gods and bow down to them or to the sun or the moon or all the army of the heavens, .....and you must stone such one with stones and such one must die." <sssss> Romans 1:20-32 ....32. <sssss> "Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them." <sssss> Numbers 31: And the Lord said unto Moses, "Avenge the children of the Mid'-an'ites.. <sssss> They warred against the Mid'-i-an'ites, as the Lord commanded Moses, and they slay all the males. <sssss> And they took all women as captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. <sssss> And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire. <sssss> Moses said, "HAVE YOU SAVED ALL THE WOMEN ALIVE? <sssss> NOW KILL EVERY MALE AMONG THE LITTLE ONES, AND KILL EVERY WOMAN that has known a man by lying with him, but all the young girls who have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves." <sssss> [Quran-60:8-9] GOD does not enjoin you from befriending those who do not fight you because of religion, and do not evict you from your homes. <sssss> You may befriend them and be equitable towards them. <sssss> GOD loves the equitable. <sssss> GOD enjoins you only from befriending those who fight you because of religion, evict you from your homes, and band together with others to banish you. <sssss> You shall not befriend them. <sssss> Those who befriend them are the transgressors.
Carla J. Schultz "kayceygirl"		Desert Heat (Beeler): Books: Judith A. Jance		2		I LOVE Joanna Brady! <sssss> However, this introduction to her and her life in Bisbee is NOT the best book Jance has ever written. <sssss> One thing that is terrific about Jance, though, is that she is from Bisbee and describes the town in exact detail. <sssss> Bisbee is a quaint crazy town and Jance grabs all of the details of that small town oasis in the desert. <sssss> Joanna Brady is a likeable character and the series gets beter and better as time goes by. <sssss> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! <sssss> !
A. Swanson		The Simple Guide to Fresh Water Aquariums (Simple Guide to...): Books: David E. Boruchowitz		2		In a hobby filled with opinions, this was a one-stop shop for beginning to up-and-running of my first large aquarium. <sssss> It was exactly what I was looking for in a book of this nature. <sssss> I'm not going to say it's the best, worst or in between because it's the only one of this nature I bought. <sssss> Since then, of course, like most folks, I've read web sites, talked to others in the hobby and formed my own opinions. <sssss> But the reason I bought this book was to cut through the confusion and get started and for that, it was terrific. <sssss> Could have used a bit more on fish and plants and that's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. <sssss> Next revision, he should throw in a bit more on the fish he picks, offer some alternatives within the scenarios he set up
O. Gonzalez		Deadly Slipper: A Novel of Death in the Dordogne: Books: Michelle Wan		1		This book is very disappointing. <sssss> The writing is terrible and rather amateurish. <sssss> The writer bored me, maybe something's lost in translation from French, I don't know. <sssss> I already knew the killer the first time he was introduced in the book, although the writer tried to create red herrings which did not work. <sssss> Mara sounds stupid, immature and inconsistent. <sssss> Skip this book, it's not worth your time. <sssss> Peter Mayle's mysteries set in France are way much better that this. <sssss> At least his novels have sense of humor, suspense, very interesting characters and most important, they are very well written
Hadradah "Hadradah"		Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order: Books: Robert Kagan		2		Good, high-level analysis of current US vs European international relations written from a conservative perspective. <sssss> As with any book covering fluid world events this book can only provide a snapshot, circa 2000-04, of those events. <sssss> But there are two significant underlying assumption in this book: First, as the single greatest world power, the US will project its power for decades in any region of the world it feels has long-term impact to its strategic goals, such as Europe throughout the entire Cold War, Southeast Asia in the 60's pppppppppp 70's and in the Middle East today. <sssss> Second, US historically has viewed itself as the proponent of the spread of liberal democracy through out the world. <sssss> Rather than focusing on the snipping back and forth between the US pppppppppp Europe, the two major assumptions of this book could serve as a litmus test to observe how current US foreign policy in the Middle East plays itself out over the next few decades. <sssss> Is it merely a current political view or a historic shift in strategic focus to a different region of the world? <sssss> Stay tuned. <sssss> It is a well-written, quick read with meaningful subcontextual insights.
A. Shalaby		Dark Watch (Oregon Files): Books: Clive Cussler,Jack Du Brul		2		very good writing done by both authors. <sssss> i've always loved C.C. <sssss> now with Du Brul, the story gets even more suspenseful. <sssss> a really awsome page turner. <sssss> get this one
John Stevenson		Photoshop Fine Art Effects Cookbook: 62 Easy-To-Follow Recipes for Creating the Classic Styles of Great Artists pppppppppp Photographers (O'Reilly Digital Studio): Books: John Beardsworth		1		Earlier this year I reviewed what many will see as the companion volume to this book ("Photoshop Blending Modes Cookbook for Digital Photographers"), written by the same author. <sssss> Unfortunately, the newer publication is less useful. <sssss> It seems to have been written on a pretext that it's clever to be able to duplicate what traditional artists can do. <sssss> This seems - from my own personal viewpoint - to be greatly undervaluing the power of Photoshop (and similar software). <sssss> Practitioners of digital fine art should (really, constructively) be looking to explore what the principles of prior and traditional art can mean within a new domain. <sssss> Plus, the book gets off to a definitely poor start. <sssss> The second and longer of two introductory sections is titled "The Tricks of the Trade". <sssss> Well it would be better if just some of the "tricks" had been explained in full and more accurately. <sssss> Say, how to make a selection in Photoshop from the best available precursor (a black-and-white alpha channel). <sssss> Or say again, how to make tonal corrections to the original photograph using a luminance mask. <sssss> Then again, the first (and shorter) of the introductory chapters, titled "The Artist's Eye", is just a teaser. <sssss> This topic - pre-visualizing what can be achieved as an output image when composing the original photographic input - could have benefited from a much more detailed explanation/argument. <sssss> Indeed, it could even merit an expansive concluding chapter (but the book doesn't have one of those at all ....). <sssss> This is, after all, at the very core of what the user could harness to any given artistic objective. <sssss> Additionally, I think that it's strange that a book such as this simply makes no reference at all to what could be printed from the recipes it contains. <sssss> Some of the finished (output) images might look quite intriguing as 3 by 5 inch reproductions in the book - but does the methodology hold up if you're targeting a 20 by 36 inch output (say) on a large format printer? <sssss> And what to do if that's not the case? <sssss> Finally, and in common with the earlier companion volume, this book suffers from strange and inconsistent layouts of screenshots and text, plus all sorts of technical and editing omissions/errors (which include, for example, having the wrong screenshot in the wrong recipe - see p.108)
A book lover		Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life: Books: Michael Lewis		1		I like the idea that Michael Lewis wrote this book/article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that. <sssss> Having said that I did not like this book: 1) the writing was chopping and hard to follow at times. <sssss> i had to re-read many sentences to understand lewis' point. <sssss> 2) the story lacked the depth of lewis' other wonderful books - where's the who/why/what that lewis used to moneyball (and others) educational - i wanted the story behind the story. <sssss> 3) who were all the pictures of? <sssss> i found them distracting... i'll continue to read lewis' books bu thope the next one is bette
Gordon Comstock "Gord"		Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds: Books: Phillip E. Johnson		2		Stimulating, compelling primer on the fallacies of naturalistic evolution. <sssss> In a philosophical wrestling match, Phillip Johnson bends Richard Dawkins into a pretzel and pins his shoulders to the mat in three seconds or less. <sssss> Macroevolutionary Darwinism is living on borrowed time. <sssss> Within 50 years it will join the ranks of Geocentric Universe Theories, phlogistons, and phrenologies. <sssss> A lot of guys with letters after their names are going to have to look for new work, or else be honest enough to convert from their naturalistic religion to a real form of science, that pursues Truth no matter where it leads
J. Berg "Red Ink"		Red Lily: In the Garden Trilogy (In the Garden (Paperback)): Books: Nora Roberts		1		The story was slow, predictable and boring. <sssss> I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it. <sssss> It's a dud in my opinion
JAD		The Lord Is My Shepherd: Healing Wisdom of the Twenty-third Psalm: Books: Harold S. Kushner		2		Rabbi Harold S. Kushner is one of the best known authors of our time, having written the classic book, When Bad Things Happen to Good People. <sssss> This, his ninth book, was one of the top ten best selling religious books of the past year. <sssss> As the title indicates, it is a study of Psalm 23, certainly the most beloved of all of the Psalms. <sssss> Dr. Kushner writes with a pastor's heart and a special eye toward the healing wisdom to be found in that portion of God's Word. <sssss> If you are looking for a book about putting your spiritual life into meaningful practice, you might wish to read this book. <sssss> It is filled with inspiration and encouragement for an ongoing trusting relationship with God. <sssss> Kushner takes each phrase of the Psalm as his chapter headings, and verse by verse, provides insight and practical suggestions for how to make these truths come alive each day. <sssss> Throughout the book, Kushner utilizes his vast knowledge of the original Hebrew text to help the reader understand the nuances of the words such as "soul" and "cup". <sssss> He explains the nuances of what the soul is and why the soul needs nourishing. <sssss> He states, "The world asks so much of us. <sssss> We give ourselves so totally to our work, to the task of raising our family and running a home that we often forget to take time to nourish our souls..." (page 61). <sssss> The fact that God helps us "feel safe in an unsafe world" (page 50) is the Psalmist's theme, repeated and emphasized in every line. <sssss> Drawing from the world of science and literature, art and great works of theology, this deceptively small book is filled with encouragement and blessing. <sssss> Occasionally, Christians forgo reading Jewish authors, forgetting that Judaism is the forerunner of our own faith in Jesus Christ. <sssss> That would be a mistake. <sssss> For, here, we have a work that is sacred to both of our traditions, presented by an acclaimed author, dedicated scholar and proven congregational leader. <sssss> Dr. Kushner is Rabbi Laureate of Temple Israel in Natick, Massachusetts. <sssss> He has been honored by the Christophers as one of fifty people who have made the world a better place and by Religion in American Life as their Clergyman of the Year in 1999. <sssss> This is a book to read, give and savor over time. <sssss> If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.
N. Ashbarry "Kestrel 369"		Maximum Ride: Books: James Patterson		2		I saw the second title of this series at my local Borders bookstore, and decided to try the first title. <sssss> Do not be fooled by the "Young Adult" category; this book is also appropriate for full adults looking for a good read. <sssss> Though a little adolescent at times, this novel is still excellent, and I recommend it as a fun and fascinating fantasy
T. Thanatipanonda "cal136"		Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture: A Novel of Mathematical Obsession: Books: Apostolos Doxiadis		1		I want to make a short comment here: 1) This book is quite confusing. <sssss> It mixed up the real story with the make up one. <sssss> 2) Saying that Ramanujun thought Goldbach Conjecture is wrong was a huge mistake. <sssss> Everyone believe that Goldbach Conjecture is true. <sssss> And Ramanujun is a real genius. <sssss> I cannot stand this make up part
Steph		H is for Homicide (Sue Grafton): Books: Sue Grafton,Judy Kaye		1		I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series. <sssss> Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. <sssss> I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning. <sssss> I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame). <sssss> However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best. <sssss> You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few. <sssss> The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics. <sssss> But even with these issues, I did finish the book. <sssss> Grafton at her low point is still a good read
Paul Skinner		Edge of Evil: Books: J. A. Jance		2		I really don't understand all the negative reviews about this book. <sssss> I found it an easy to read pleasant mystery, with a main character in midlife turmoil I wanted to sympathize with. <sssss> J. <sssss> A. Jance did an excellent job keeping the pace reasonably fast, while not losing the reader with extraneous characters.
Ali Hasan "Filmmaker - Teacher - Political Commentator/Writer"		Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences: Books: Howard Gardner		2		Currently, educational studies are being revealed, which are showing that students of minority heritage (particularly Black and Latino) have an affinity towards InterPersonal learning and Tactile learning Interpersonal = learning through being social and group work Tactile = learning by building or constructing things Our current educational institutions, especially high school and below, cater to Auditory (hearing) and Intrapersonal (introverted, little group work) learners So in total, poverty and language barriers are likely not the biggest culprit towards our low school scores, in areas of economic problems ----- rather, it is the fact that teachers are not teaching to the strengths of our children - as a matter of fact, most children are being taught within the areas of their learning weaknesses With that in mind, FRAMES OF MIND is one of the first books to distiguish the way we learn and how to cater to it Within this book lies the best solutions to our educational system, and its only a matter of getting the teachers to facilitate their lesson plans differently I highly recommend this book - especially to those who are interested in seeing what the future of America is all abou
F. Hall "bjazz"		Complete Digital Photography, Third Edition (Digital Photography Series): Books: Ben Long		2		This book explains in simple terms all the stuff that the other one's don't explain. <sssss> It's one of the best books on photography hands down. <sssss> It's clearly the next step in amature photography you will need.I am currently waiting for it to arrive at my door. <sssss> I have read it already. <sssss> I want to own it so I have it forever. <sssss> I plain on absorbing every comma, period and explaination mark, and explaining it to everyone. <sssss> My hat's off to the author. <sssss> I LIKE IT
Mark Gospri		Running with Scissors: A Memoir: Books: Augusten Burroughs		1		THis book was horrible. <sssss> If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have. <sssss> I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend. <sssss> I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire. <sssss> One less copy in the world...don't waste your money. <sssss> I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes. <sssss> THis book wasted my life
Fernando Gomez		Elements of Information Theory: Books: Thomas M. Cover,Joy A. Thomas		2		I took the 2 Tom Cover's classes in Information Theory at Stanford last year. <sssss> We used this book as the text for both classes. <sssss> The first class covered roughly the first 8 chapters and the second class the remaining ones. <sssss> This book assumes that the reader has a clear understanding of basic probability theory. <sssss> Tom's classes were among the most enjoyable I took last year and I recommend this text to anyone interested in knowing about Information Theory. <sssss> If you just want to know the basics, read through chapters 1-8. <sssss> The reader interested in understanding the power of information theory is adviced to read the whole book. <sssss> A final comment, it is clear to me after my experience with Tom's classes that mastering Information Theory is a daunting task. <sssss> And in fact, this book provides the interested researcher just with the basic knowledge needed to enter the field
Old Student		A Hat Full of Sky: Books: Terry Pratchett		2		I had to read this book as an assignment for a Seminary class on Leadership. <sssss> I was sceptical that a children's book about witches would be applicable to a master's level college course. <sssss> My scepticism was unfounded. <sssss> This is a good, fun read. <sssss> But, more than that, this is a story that tugs at heart strings and teaches through the trials and personalities of it's characters. <sssss> I recommend it to "children" of all ages!
Peter		Lucky You: Books: Carl Hiaasen		2		I enjoyed this novel. <sssss> It wasn't Hiaasen's best work but it was well beyond a lot of novels one could read. <sssss> Hiaasen has the ability to look at the lower end of society and bring out the humour in how they conduct their lives. <sssss> In this novel, two people win the Lotto. <sssss> Ordinarily this would be a cause for celebration but when one of the winners bemoans the fact that they have to share their spoils with another and they are wanna-be white supremists, then the adventure starts. <sssss> The shenanigans of the characters is both humourous and engrossing, this is a book that I recommend
Words And Music		The Wind Done Gone: Books: Alice Randall		1		The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. <sssss> Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. <sssss> Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths. <sssss> Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL
Irfan A. Alvi		A Sense of the Mysterious: Science and the Human Spirit: Books: Alan Lightman		2		Alan Lightman is one of those rare individuals who has a solid background in both physics and the humanities. <sssss> As a result, he has been able to write this very enjoyable collection of essays dealing with the human context of science, especially physics. <sssss> None of the essays are ultra profound, but they're still insightful enough to make worthwhile reading, especially considering that the amount of literature in this genre is fairly limited. <sssss> This book reminds me of "Feynman's Rainbow" by Leonard Mlodinow, which I also found to be very enjoyable and, like Mlodinow's book, Lightman's book is a quick read. <sssss> As other reviewers have noted, the specific essay topics are a mixed bag including autobiography, biography, the relationship between math and physics, the nature and experience of scientific inquiry, and other broader topics such as the influence of technology in human life. <sssss> As indicated in my title, if you have at least a popular-level familiarity with modern physics, and can also appreciate the humanities, I predict that you will find this book to be quite enjoyable, and perhaps also somewhat enlightening. <sssss> I enjoyed reading the book, and I expect that I will read it again in the future
Nancy O'Connell		New York Cookbook: From Pelham Bay to Park Avenue, Firehouses to Four-Star Restaurants: Books: Molly O'Neill		1		If you want to spend 4 times as much money, 8 times as much time, and 12 times as much frustration trying to serve something that your guests will ultimately "politely refuse"--THEN BUY THIS BOOK! <sssss> The author clearly has NO CLUE that "less is often more.
"2boyzmom"		The Golden Notebook: Books: Doris May Lessing		1		I bought this book 2 years ago - almost to the day...I have the receipt stuck in the book...I can only seem to force myself to get to page 50 and then I just can't stomach anymore and I put it down for 2 more years. <sssss> Maybe this is a piece of art. <sssss> Something to be treasured and something that should change your life. <sssss> But pleasure reading shouldn't be this painful. <sssss> I wish the store would take it back - but I think I've probably had it for too long
Miss Lively "catering to nobody special"		The Bonesetter's Daughter: Books: Amy Tan		2		Amy Tan writes about wonderful people. <sssss> Amy Tan creates exceptional characters. <sssss> Amy Tan will write you a story that is so rich and clear you can almost touch it. <sssss> That is what I love in reading Amy Tan. <sssss> As your average southern white female, I'm not exactly versed in the world of Amy Tan's characters. <sssss> But she takes me there. <sssss> I find myself so completely involved in the world she writes about that I forget where I am. <sssss> Isn't that why you pedalled your bicycle to the library in the summer when you were a kid? <sssss> Amy Tan will remind you of that sense of discovery you had back then, when you were reading all the great classics for the first time and the discovery of it all was an addictive thrill that kept your library card smoking and well worn with use. <sssss> She has a gift in her storytelling for expanding the universe. <sssss> Read this book.
jerry preusser		How to Do Just About Everything: Books		1		If you just got out of prison or maybe had a spell of amnesia or if your just hitting your 20th or 21st birthday then you may learn some stuff here. <sssss> But if you got yourself online to read this review then I doubt you will find this book much help. <sssss> There were a few helpful ehows for me in the book though. <sssss> For example I forgot exactly how to boil an egg. <sssss> And there it was in the book. <sssss> A typical type of ehow. <sssss> And this book is BIG and HEAVY. <sssss> with most info ridiculously simple I would say the size to useful ratio is not that desirable. <sssss> Maybe this would make an ok high school graduation gift but other than that most people should avoid this book. <sssss> The ehow website is great though and its FREE!.
C. Johnson		Out: A Novel: Books: Natsuo Kirino		2		On the surface, Natsuo Kirino gives us a book loaded with nail-biting, page turning suspense. <sssss> What lies beneath is a scathing commentary on the social climate for women in Japan. <sssss> Women are seen as beautiful young pets, or useless old bags. <sssss> Kirino shows a side of Japan that I didn't know existed. <sssss> Kirino's brilliant characterization makes this book work. <sssss> Every person is fleshed out within the context of the story, and flashbacks are only used when absolutely necessary. <sssss> I never felt like the story was on hold while I learned about someone's childhood. <sssss> I can't stand it when writers stop a story cold just to fill in holes that they have created. <sssss> Kirino doesn't have that problem. <sssss> The book has a bit of a slow start, but it is necessary for the author to paint a picure of the mundane world the characters live in before things start to heat up. <sssss> The story picks up momentum and charges through to a brilliant ending (I have to disagree with other reviewers who disliked the ending. <sssss> If you don't like the ending, you may be missing the point of the whole book). <sssss> The plot twists manage to surprise the reader without feeling forced. <sssss> Kirino's style is concise and well-paced. <sssss> My one complaint is that it is difficult to keep the characters straight because of their similar names. <sssss> With names like Yayoi, Yoshie, and Yoko it's hard to know who's who at times. <sssss> This may show my American ignorance, but I have to admit that this was a problem for me. <sssss> This minor complaint aside, I loved this book and I highly recommend it to all fans of crime fiction
M. Roman "matt1234567"		Sitting Pretty: Looking and Feeling Better With Good Posture in Ten Easy Steps: Books: Gregg J. Carb		1		I was extremely disappointed by this book/pamphlet, being misled by the other favorable reviews. <sssss> It is completely lacking in information. <sssss> It has 51 6"x8" pages with huge font and too many cartoons. <sssss> It successfully defines what is good and bad posture, but does not provide excercises to improve it (it simply states to "practice" good posture). <sssss> There are much much better alternatives. <sssss> I have read "Posture Alignment" and recommend that, and have heard of great reviews for "Posture, Get It Straight!"
T. R. Matheson "timwerx"		The Pickwick Papers: Books: Charles Dickens		2		I just finished my second reading of it. <sssss> I really cannot add much to the great reviews already written. <sssss> I've always loved Dickens' way with words, and this book is a treasure in that department. <sssss> The English, the Era, the characters, the countryside.... it got to the point where I couldn't wait for the evening to come so I could continue reading. <sssss> This also seems to me to be an important "cornerstone book" for other great English literature. <sssss> The theme (though just a seed) for Scrooge in A Christmas Carol begins here, in a story called The Goblin Who Stole a Sexton, a story related during one of Pickwick's Christmastime visits to a friend in the country. <sssss> When reading The Wind in the Willows or Tolkien's works, I cannot escape the feeling that they were also influenced by the charm, the sense of humor (okay, humour), duty to friends, and the simple but most important things in life which Dickens so impressively describes. <sssss> The only negative thing is that I discovered that it had an effect on me which made me wish that I was free from the drudgery of daily work, was retired (with ample monetary means, of course, like Pickwick himself), and could devote the remainder of my life to similar ramblings, adventures, and pursuits. <sssss> An excellent book
J. Shultz		Pantone Guide to Communicating with Color: Books: Leatrice Eiseman		2		I use this book and/or refer someone to it almost every day in my line of work. <sssss> I highly recommend it to anyone who works with color
Steve Murray		Leadership by the Book: Tools to Transform Your Workplace: Books: Ken Blanchard,Bill Hybels		2		Blanchard and Hybels and Hodges team up for an excellent perspective on leadership from a Christian point of view. <sssss> While reaching out to the secular marketplace with valid concepts for servant leadership, they put together an excellent framework for leadership. <sssss> The summary checklist, given on pp. <sssss> 171ff., offer a helpful concise summary of the book. <sssss> The glaring omission, and one that I can't believe that Hybels would make, is to clearly point out that following Jesus' style of leadership is absolutely impossible apart from first having a personal relationship with Jesus, in other words, you can't lead like Jesus if you don't have him in your life to help you. <sssss> I can't believe that there wasn't at least an appendix for those who would like to pursue that issue further. <sssss> I believe that the authors are posturing too much to get the secular audience to read the book. <sssss> But for the Christian, it is an excellent book
James Stephen Garrett "Teep"		The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets Of Americas Wealthy: Books: Thomas J. Stanley,William D. Danko,Cotter Smith		1		The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work pppppppppp no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy". <sssss> Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion: Millionaires, you see: 1) Save more than they spend; 2) Don't spend anything. <sssss> That's it. <sssss> Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. <sssss> Clip coupons. <sssss> Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. <sssss> Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane. <sssss> To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting pppppppppp the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun? <sssss> Didn't think so. <sssss> Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. <sssss> Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. <sssss> Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large. <sssss> It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. <sssss> And you can always outspend it. <sssss> That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt. <sssss> But there pitfalls at the other extreme. <sssss> Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. <sssss> The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. <sssss> Total skinflint. <sssss> Miser. <sssss> Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. <sssss> Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices. <sssss> The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. <sssss> But he's also a loser. <sssss> This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. <sssss> Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. <sssss> Is that any way to live? <sssss> Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'? <sssss> I think not. <sssss> Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. <sssss> Desire. <sssss> Demand. <sssss> What else is work for? <sssss> Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow. <sssss> But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! <sssss> What is money for, if not to indulge yourself? <sssss> Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. <sssss> But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? <sssss> Sound like a plan? <sssss> I think not. <sssss> Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom. <sssss> "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it. <sssss> "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! <sssss> Die loaded! <sssss> ), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints. <sssss> But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. <sssss> I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again? <sssss> JS
Andrew Maloney		Six Frigates: The Epic History of the Founding of the U.S. Navy: Books: Ian W. Toll,Stephen Lang		2		I read "Six Frigates" sailing south down the coast of Australia from Hamilton Island in the Whitsunday group. <sssss> Keen to dodge a storm, we did a 48 hour dash down to the safety of Yepoon running a 3 hours on/3 hours off watch cycle. <sssss> Problem was I didnt get any sleep. <sssss> I was too deep inside Six Frigates. <sssss> Back on deck, I'd update my watch on what I'd just read. <sssss> They loved it. <sssss> Sailing by instalments. <sssss> Ian Toll's a wonderful writer. <sssss> The man is a time machine. <sssss> He drops you right into the middle of the smoke-filled, blood splattered action. <sssss> Patrick O'Brian fans: this is the book for you. <sssss> Toll's also a deft hand at dropping insights that get you thinking. <sssss> Like the half-parargraph mention of Madison writing to Thomas Jefferson agreeing that a war with the arab states of north africa could easily be won, and in the process stop the attacks on US merchant ships but advises Jefferson that the issue will be the cost of then keeping the peace... Perhaps George W should have a read a little more history at college. <sssss> You'll taste the sweat and blood and salt on every page. <sssss> Best read I've had in ages. <sssss> And my shipmates agree! <sssss> cheers Andrew Maloney Aboard Sonne
Iris J. Stewart, author, pppppppppp quot;Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance: Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and Ritual pppppppppp quot; (Inner Traditions, Intl. 2000)		Write from the Heart : Unleashing the Power of Your Creativity: Books: Hal Zina Bennett		2		Hal Zina Bennett's profound advice from his prolific writing career (over 30 published books) is, pppppppppp quot;write from the heart pppppppppp quot;. <sssss> As wonderful as that sounds, most writers know it's not an easy thing to do. <sssss> Hal takes us to another dimension by sharing his personal process and showing each of us how we can remove the blocks to our expression and creativity by learning how to speak from our heart to the heart of our reader. <sssss> I can speak from my own personal experience, having attended his workshops and received personal counselling from him in the process of writing my book, pppppppppp quot;Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance: Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and Ritual pppppppppp quot;. <sssss> pppppppppp quot;Write From the Heart pppppppppp quot; also offers practical guidance in several areas. <sssss> This includes such things as the need for solitude. <sssss> However, he is not just talking about having pppppppppp quot;a quiet space pppppppppp quot;, he goes beyond the physical to the inner - a state of mind. <sssss> He says, pppppppppp quot;Once we know what it is, what it looks like and feels like, we can create it for ourselves, almost--I say pppppppppp quot;almost pppppppppp quot;--regardless of where we happen to be. <sssss> pppppppppp quot; I would certainly recommend this book to anyone writing for personal expression or looking to be published
A. Mennel "acmennel"		Stitch 'n Bitch Nation: Books: Debbie Stoller		2		The patterns in this book are really interesting. <sssss> They range from everything to cabled belts to baby booties to light sweaters. <sssss> This isn't as informative as the original "Stitch 'n Bitch" book, but if you have mastered the basics, it is a good starting point for ideas. <sssss> Plus, it has tried and true tips and tricks from knitters accross the nation.
Josh		Students' Guide to Colleges: The Definitive Guide to America's Top 100 SchoolsWritten by the Real Experts--the Students Who Attend Them: Books: Jordan Goldman,Colleen Buyers		2		As a prospective college student, I have to tell you how much I appreciate Students' Guide to Colleges. <sssss> It combines many of the best features of the Princeton Review and Fiske guides with much more comprehensiveness. <sssss> I also appreciate that it is without any trying-to-sound-hip blather because these are not editor-interjected profiles, they're written by actual students. <sssss> This is a great compliment--I have been looking at colleges seriously for about a year, and this is the best guide to colleges among the many I've seen. <sssss> I also just read the Oberlin College profile in this book with an Oberlin alum and relative. <sssss> She said that this was this most comprehensive and accurate Oberlin portrayal she's read in a guide. <sssss> Among other things, she and I loved the different student perspectives and the unthinkable-in-previous-guides questions like "what aspect of your school would a prospective student not see on a college tour?" <sssss> The guide's honesty also impressed me, as the Fiske guide lauded Vassar's "diversity," for example, where Students' Guide admits "Although Vassar likes to talk about diversity a lot, most students are actually wealthy and white." <sssss> I am confident in saying that anyone applying anywhere from Hampshire to Harvard will find this book incredibly useful!! <sssss> -Josh
T. S. Phillis		The Ayn Rand Cult: Books: Jeff Walker		1		Like most critics of Objectivism, Mr. Walker focuses his criticism on Ayn Rand's frailties and idiosyncrasies rather than the principles of the philosophy she founded. <sssss> My disappointment in his book was immediate and I have to say it's as unoriginal a piece of writing as any other critic I've read. <sssss> His cynicism drips from almost every sentence and his contempt for all things Objectivism is obvious to anyone who takes ideas seriously. <sssss> I cannot recommend this book even to those interested in contrasting views of her approach to philosophy; this book was written for those of like mind to the author...whatever mind they can be said to have. <sssss> The body and scope of work done by Objectivist scholars who've never met Ayn Rand now ellipses her work - both fiction and non-fiction - and the work of her original core of thinkers. <sssss> To characterize the movement as a cult may have had some validity in the years prior to her death, but only in the most remote sense of the word. <sssss> Right now the ranks of Objectivism are swelling with intelligent people who differ in background AND in opinion. <sssss> Mr. Walker's principle mistake is looking at Objectivism as something that was born exclusively from the mind of Ayn Rand...something Miss Rand herself would disagree with. <sssss> Objectivism is the logical continuation of a line of thought that views mankind as a reasoning animal...a line that extends back through history and begins (explicitly) with Aristotle. <sssss> Those (like Mr. Walker) who dismiss it on the basis of Miss Rand's personality and the culture of people that grew around her in her lifetime are truly missing an opportunity to enlighten themselves. <sssss> There is no doubt Ayn Rand is a polarizing figure; my advice to those inclined to read Mr. Walker's book is to read Miss Rand's books as well. <sssss> Particularly her non-fiction. <sssss> I'm not a real big fan of her novels or fiction in general - it was Rand's non-fiction works that first inspired me to study her philosophy - so my first suggestion would be "Philosophy: Who Needs It." <sssss> I enjoyed her novels, but I enjoyed her non-fiction more
Pamela A. Johnson "Pam"		An Unexpected Song: Books: Iris Johansen		1		I have never read one of Johansen's books and after reading this one, I'm not likely to read another. <sssss> I usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means, but I just couldn't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing. <sssss> Exclamations such as "dear heaven" and "lord" were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book, which doesn't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone (it would suit my southern grandma, however). <sssss> As another reviewer said, the big mystery of why Daisy wouldn't leave Geneva wasn't particularly mysterious - if she really wanted Jason to leave she could have just told him. <sssss> Character development was lacking and I just didn't care that much about them. <sssss> I would have liked to hear more about Cynthia and her antics. <sssss> I did finish the book because I was curious to know what happened, but I couldn't wait for it to be over. <sssss> Sorry, but this was not my cup of tea
Diane L. Schirf		Tropic of Cancer: Books: Henry Miller		1		Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. <sssss> Not recommended. <sssss> In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer, Karl Shapiro said, "I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is," ". <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age," and ". <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. <sssss> This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must." <sssss> Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either. <sssss> Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller's experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. <sssss> Miller's stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. <sssss> Miller writes, "A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. <sssss> I no longer think about it, I am"--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances. <sssss> When they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). <sssss> They rarely use a neutral term such as "woman" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. <sssss> The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. <sssss> In spite of all the vice and the "living," no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life. <sssss> Miller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. <sssss> Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. <sssss> When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as ". <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot," he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine. <sssss> Miller's logic about the working world is facile; he writes, "If you want bread, you've got to get in harness, get in lockstep." <sssss> On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. <sssss> In other words, if most people weren't in "lock step," Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. <sssss> He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. <sssss> He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including "the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers"), a reliance which he resents. <sssss> He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives. <sssss> Seemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing. <sssss> When a friend says, "A boy can break your heart . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> He's so damned beautiful! <sssss> And so cruel!" <sssss> Miller writes, "We had to laugh at this. <sssss> It sounded preposterous. <sssss> But Collins was in earnest." <sssss> When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies, he writes, "At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good." <sssss> Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet, but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense. <sssss> Speaking of buildings and statues, Miller says, " . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> they must be saturated with my anguish," the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges. <sssss> He describes artists such as himself as the "inhuman ones." <sssss> "I am inhuman! <sssss> I say it with a mad, hallucinated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles. <sssss> Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinning a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw, some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on." <sssss> Whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared, rambling on for pages, I found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes, disease, friends, and hunger. <sssss> Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the worst book I have ever read (and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn). <sssss> Shapiro says, "There are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [emancipated from what? <sssss> --DLS], these clowns and clairvoyants, celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of America." <sssss> If Miller, with his whining, his criticism, his holier-than-everyone attitude, his "art," his two-dimensional view of people, and his obsession with excrement, is the "greatest" of these souls, may I never meet the least. <sssss> Note: If there were a 0 stars option, Tropic of Cancer would have earned it
Rick Wingender		Managing Innovation: Integrating Technological, Market, and Organizational Change, 2nd Edition: Books: Joe Tidd,John Bessant,Keith Pavitt		1		Of all the textbooks I've had, from elementary school through graduate school, this is easily the worst one I've ever had, for any course. <sssss> First of all, the authors so redundantly use the word "whilst" and the phrase "rules of the game" that it really gets on your nerves. <sssss> My classmates all agree with me on this point. <sssss> Second, speaking of getting on your nerves, half of what these authors say is, "...as we talked about in the previous chapter" or "as we'll talk about in the next chapter". <sssss> There is so much redundant language in this book that it really could be condensed to about 25% of its size, and hell, it probably could simply be a chapter in the text for some other course. <sssss> Third, the authors should win a Pulitzer prize for flowery language. <sssss> They seem more interested in impressing me than educating me. <sssss> Their sentences are far too long. <sssss> They don't know the meaning of clear and concise, and I think they should all go back to English Composition 101. <sssss> They'd be great politicians, because never have I heard anyone say so much and yet say so little....over and over and over again. <sssss> The book is a like an inflated academic paper...and it's BORING. <sssss> If ever a topic begged for a case-study approach, it's this one, and this book is not the answer. <sssss> Save your money, and beg your instructor not to use this text.
E. Abrams		Elizabeth Costello (Spanish): Books: J. M. Coetzee		1		I really expected more from Coetzee, whom I had never read before picking up this book. <sssss> I saw after finishing the book that it was originally published as separate stories or vignettes, and I'm not surprised. <sssss> The title character spends all of her time giving speeches, which is strange for a novel--you think you will get a plot, but you just get lectured to. <sssss> The writing is good, spare and cogent, but the book does not hang together well enough to be a novel, in my opinion. <sssss> The best chapter, which is the last, has little or nothing to do with the prior chapters
Thomas J. Hickey		Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days (Left Behind No. 1): Books: Tim F. LaHaye,Jerry B. Jenkins		1		Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty." <sssss> But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture." <sssss> Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer. <sssss> The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions. <sssss> In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions. <sssss> Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform. <sssss> Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. <sssss> Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority. <sssss> They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. <sssss> Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations. <sssss> The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. <sssss> Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines. <sssss> Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society. <sssss> I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind. <sssss> And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so. <sssss> Thomas J. Hickey
Ronald L. Rushton		Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything: Books: Steven D. Levitt,Stephen J. Dubner		2		One of the most interesting books I've ever read! <sssss> I could not put this one down. <sssss> If all economics books were written this well, everyone would want to be an economist! <sssss> The author has a unique perspective on the analysis of data that is very compelling. <sssss> He will make you question every "fact" you've ever heard and observe the world around you from a different angle
Jo Friday		Ask Not: The Inauguration of John F. Kennedy and the Speech That Changed America: Books: Thurston Clarke		1		Clarke's glaring research error: Author of The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931), in an article titled "The New Frontier" wrote "Are you a politician asking what your country can do for you or a zealous one asking what can you do for your country?". <sssss> Clarke sure missed this one, as have so many before him. <sssss> Did Kennedy just paraphrase, or did he plagarize? <sssss> I would have liked to have seen Clarke deal with this sticky issue.
Maryle Van Allen		Planets in Transit: Life Cycles for Living (The Planet Series): Books: Robert Hand		2		I wish I had put some kind of protection on my Transits by Hand. <sssss> I did not buy the hardback and usage of the paperback over the years by me and my daughter has managed to deteriorate the 2 or 3 copies I've had to reorder! <sssss> I always read other books about transiting planets and their influence, but for the final touch I always resort to the master himself, Robert Hand. <sssss> I was lucky enough to hear a few of his tapes and he is absolutely fascinating to listen to; has a delightful sense of humor (Sagittarius influence), is a supreme story-teller, which makes it impossible not to learn as you listen. <sssss> A lot of hard work must have gone into this work. <sssss> If anyone is to break the barriers between astrology and scientific worlds, Hand would be the one to lead the onslaught! <sssss> No astrologer or anyone learning astrology could do without this book
Alex A. Guzman "alexpana"		Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth: Book 1: Books: Peter Kelder		2		In the month that I have been puting the teaching into practice,I have felt better like I haven't felt in eleven years. <sssss> My weight is going down and my energy is increasing. <sssss> I am getting a lot of compliments, and someone told me I look more like 31 than 51 which is my real age
C. Scheller "ABD"		Qualitative Evaluation Methods: Books: Michael Quinn Patton		2		Patton describes qualitative research design and data collection methods in a way that even the novice researcher can easily understand and utilize.
artanis65		The History of Money: Books: Jack Weatherford		1		This is the sort of book you get when an author writes on a subject with which he has only a passing familiarity, and lacks the confidence that the subject matter is inherently interesting enough to hold the reader's attention. <sssss> The result is a book that is ultimately unsatisfying. <sssss> One symptom of the problems described above is that large portions are devoted to subjects other than money. <sssss> For example, the author uses the first three pages after the introduction to describe Aztec ritual sacrifice in literally gory detail before proceeding on to the use of cocao beans as commodity money. <sssss> I think that's meant to be what they used to call in show business a "grabber," but for the reader expecting to learn about money, it's a distraction. <sssss> Another problem is that the author's grasp of modern economics is shaky at best, and especially in the latter part of the book, he'll make a point and then repeat himself, much as an undergraduate trying to extend the length of a term paper that's run a few pages short. <sssss> And yet, there's also some interesting and oddly convincing tidbits of information here. <sssss> The author states that L. Frank Baum's 1900 book "The Wizard of Oz" is really a parable about the need for a bimetallic dollar based on both gold and silver. <sssss> But even as it strikes you that this is an interesting bit of trivia, you realize that it's only a bit of trivia and has little larger significance. <sssss> If you're looking for a economic history of money, you should look elsewhere. <sssss> If you're interested in the cultural and sociological impact of money, this may be more to your liking, though I think it still falls short.
J. Smith		The Old, Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes: Books: Greil Marcus		2		This is a retitled re-issue of _Invisible Republic_. <sssss> For its content, then, it clearly deserves a 5-star rating (at least from here). <sssss> However, you ought to know what you will be getting if you already have that classic
LJ Singleton		Covered Wagons, Bumpy Trails: Books: Verla Kay,S. D. Schindler		2		Verla Kay has done it again! <sssss> She's created a brilliant rhyming picture book that works great in the classroom and is also a delightful choice for a bedtime story. <sssss> COVERED WAGONS, BUMPY TRAILS is the vivid, touching, enjoyable story of a pioneer family moving West. <sssss> Readers will fall in love with pppppppppp quot;Mother, Father and Baby John pppppppppp quot; as they journey in search of a new home. <sssss> Their struggles and triumphs come alive in sparse pppppppppp quot;cryptic rhyme pppppppppp quot; verse, such as: pppppppppp quot;Plunging, slipping, Stuck in snow. <sssss> Frozen wheels, pppppppppp quot;Oxen, WHOA! <sssss> pppppppppp quot; And the art by S. D. Schindler is fabulous with colorful kid-appeal. <sssss> This is a wonderful book that you won't want to miss! <sssss> When you reach the final page, you'll smile at the absolute PERFECT ending
Jewish Book World Magazine		It's Shofar Time!: Books: Latifa Berry Kropf,Tod Cohen		2		This is the sixth and final addition to the author's excellent Holiday Time series, just in time for Rosh Hashanah! <sssss> As in the other titles, (It's Challah Time! <sssss> It's Seder Time! <sssss> etc.) <sssss> Tod Cohen's full-color photos capture the joyousness of the children as they learn to celebrate the holiday wearing new clothes, making Jewish New Year's cards for their families, tasting new foods such as pomegranates and star fruits, and blowing the shofar. <sssss> The sounds of the shofar are explained in easy, understandable terms for this young age level. <sssss> The children are also shown learning such things as tying their shoes and writing their names. <sssss> The brief amount of text on each page and very appealing children pictured learning to make round challot and blow the shofar make this just right for using with pre-schoolers, their parents, and in the classroom. <sssss> Included is an easy shofar craft and a brief paragraph about Rosh Hashanah. <sssss> Recommended for all Jewish libraries. <sssss> Ages: 4-6. <sssss> Reviewed by Andrea Davidso
David Knadler Esq II		A Military History of the Western World: From the American Civil War to the End of World War II: Books: J. F. C. Fuller		2		Fuller offers an insightful blend of battlefield detail and the broader causes and effects for each engagement presented. <sssss> He avoids one of the major shortcomings I have with a lot of other military history authors: bogging the reader down in pedantic minutiae.
Yuval Shafir		Vault Guide to the Case Interview (Vault Guide to the Case Interview): Books: Vault Staff		1		Hi, I have used this book among others to get accepted to McKinsey (and with success) and I think this book gave me less then others. <sssss> The advantages are the more or less detailed frameworks chapter and the real-life interviews chapter, but the cases themselves are rather superficial and sometimes even obviously ridiculous(like for example the case in which a Star-Trek like omnipotent people transporter has been invented, and the book claims that it wouldn't replace cars because it costs 100,000$. <sssss> Come on, they would buy one for every block). <sssss> I think there are much better resources than this. <sssss> Good luck with your interviews
Reviewer		Truth, Knowledge, Or Just Plain Bull: How To Tell The Difference : A Handbook of Practical Logic and Clear Thinking: Books: Bernard M. Patten		1		I was disappointed in this book--especially after reading the other stellar reviews (which are all, weirdly, from Texas, where the author lives). <sssss> When it's a book about logic and clear thinking, a reader expects that book to be free of typographical errors, imprecise logic, and muddled thinking. <sssss> Needless to say, I almost put the book down after reading the introduction because of the missing words and typographical errors. <sssss> Exampe from page 11: "Because the real is out there, we must effectively with it...." Here's another gem from the same page: "I am sorry to have to tell you that fact, but that is the way things are. <sssss> That is the nature of nature. <sssss> That is the reality of reality." <sssss> Look at page 33. <sssss> The author states, "Why when one exception is uncovered, multiple other exceptions surface almost right away is not entirely clear.... <sssss> Probably this has something to do with the way we humans view reality." <sssss> Very disappointing--hasn't this author studied any cognitive psychology? <sssss> It's called confirmation bias and it's entirely clear. <sssss> One more example! <sssss> On page 60, the author states that Barbara Boxer, a senator from California, "doesn't know the difference between a revolver and a semiautomatic pistol" and is "unlikely to shed intelligent light on the relative safety of either gun." <sssss> Ouch. <sssss> How does he know what Barbara Boxer knows or doesn't know? <sssss> She's actually very well-versed on the difference between the two; has he heard her speak on the subject? <sssss> It comes across as more of an ad hominem attack than anything. <sssss> Anyway, save your money on this book and instead buy Jamie Whyte's CRIMES AGAINST LOGIC. <sssss> Now that's a well-written book!
None Whatsoever "the 3rd opinion"		Be Cool: Books: Elmore Leonard		1		after get shorty, e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again, with this single-minded purpose focused, e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty. <sssss> and he was right again, it was bought and made into a movie again, but pathetically, a horrible one compared to get shorty. <sssss> the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind. <sssss> i simply failed to find there's any interest in reading this going nowhere story. <sssss> it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie, with all the bore-to-death script, dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap. <sssss> how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles, especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty'? <sssss> you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose'? <sssss> and at every corner of los angeles, every table in any restaurant, almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer'? <sssss> and you have to ask yourself: since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer, even a director in person? <sssss> even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are? <sssss> yeah, maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly? <sssss> and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show? <sssss> give me a break! <sssss> this book, from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer, so shallow and so superficious! <sssss> just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in
Richard Culter		The Lives of John Lennon: Books: Albert Goldman		2		The original publication of _The Lives of John Lennon_ in 1988 was accompanied by hysteria. <sssss> Much of it emanated from Yoko Ono, who likened Goldman's book to "being punched in the face." <sssss> Yoko is a close friend of Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine, which duly ran an article attempting to discredit Goldman's book. <sssss> Some of Lennon's fans took this behavior in and assumed that _The Lives of John Lennon_ was forbidden; they would not read it because doing so would make them naughty. <sssss> Now, however, the dust has settled, and _The Lives of John Lennon_ holds up beautifully. <sssss> Each contention of Goldman's which was alleged to be outrageous in 1988 stands. <sssss> Remember the ridiculous panic over Goldman's portrait of Lennon as a heavy drug user? <sssss> That drug use has now been acknowledged by just about everyone who knew Lennon, including Ono and Lennon's first wife, Cynthia Powell. <sssss> The same is true about Goldman's claims about Lennon's tendency towards violence (a tendency Lennon himself owned up to in his Playboy interview). <sssss> And, while Ono and others acted agitated over Goldman's depiction of Lennon as bisexual, Ono herself is found to have said she considered John Lennon a "closet fag" in a 1981 interview. <sssss> (Why, then, was Ono so upset by the appearance of Goldman's book? <sssss> Because of what it reveals about her.) <sssss> It will be clear to anyone who approaches Goldman's book with a fair mind that the outrage its publication originally sparked was unjustified. <sssss> _The Lives of John Lennon_ is not dishonest or flawed in any way. <sssss> A perusal at his "Sources" section reveals his awesome thoroghness. <sssss> Goldman bravely explored areas of Lennon's and Ono's lives that others shied away from out of deference to Ono, a worshipful attitude towards Lennon, and a reluctance to figure things out. <sssss> Albert Goldman was the most fearless and thorough writer to approach this subject. <sssss> _The Lives of John Lennon_ might be overwhelming to the infantile fans who deify Lennon, but for those with genuine interest in Lennon, it is indispensable.
Rene van Delft		Concept of Mind: Books: Ryle G		2		The Concept of Mind is a great book for several reasons. <sssss> The main reason to me is that Ryle clarifies the concept of being human, while he uses language in a natural way. <sssss> In stead of constructing concepts based on (for example scientific) assumptions, he shows what we already see as obvious, just by pointing out what we mean with our ordinary language. <sssss> He is far from reductionistic; mark the subtle irony: 'Man need not be degraded to a machine by being denied to be a ghost in a machine. <sssss> He might, after all, be a sort of animal, namely, a higher mammal. <sssss> There has yet to be ventured the hazardous leap to the hypothesis that perhaps he is a man.
terrance shock		What Painting Is: Books: James Elkins		1		The book starts out captivating then it suddenly shifts to Elkinks views of painting, that are strongly bent to the favor of abstractionist. <sssss> Elkinks thoughts on Jackson Pollocks creative energy is more than I wanted to know. <sssss> He devots almost an entire chapter to this already to small book, to his idol. <sssss> How Pollock flicks his wrist to get the effect of splated paint just right and Pollocks tourched stance over his works as the canvis is lying on the floor.To much! <sssss> I Do not recommend this little book
Darth Wader		Armageddon: The Cosmic Battle of the Ages (Left Behind, 11): Books: Tim LaHaye,Jerry B. Jenkins		1		This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. <sssss> First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. <sssss> There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. <sssss> This is our Second Chance on Earth. <sssss> No tribulation. <sssss> This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. <sssss> Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. <sssss> Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. <sssss> It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. <sssss> Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. <sssss> But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). <sssss> My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). <sssss> Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck.
harleycheesebutt		The Candle Cafe Cookbook: More Than 150 Enlightened Recipes from New York's Renowned Vegan Restaurant: Books: Joy Pierson,Bart Potenza,Barbara Scott-Goodman		1		I have to preface this by saying that I absolutely love eating at the candle. <sssss> So delicious. <sssss> before we moved from NYC, I thought we HAVE to get this book. <sssss> We've tried several of the recipies, following them to the letter, and have been really dissapointed everytime - with the exception of the hummus. <sssss> I think that they must be leaving out some key ingredients in a lot of these recipies, because all of the ones we have attempted have been either completely flavorless, or tasted like salt. <sssss> Don't even bother with the soups unless you are a gourmet cook and can figure out how to punch them up somehow after following these directions, because they all end up runny and bland. <sssss> so sad
Michael Bails		Two Flutes Playing: A Spiritual Journeybook for Gay Men (White Crane Spirituality): Books: Andrew Ramer,Mark Thompson		2		I was recommended this book after having taken a Body Electric workshop a few weeks before. <sssss> From the first page I began to re-live the entire bonding rituals that we had experienced over that weekend. <sssss> How to connect, how to communicate, and how to intimately bond on a higher plane! <sssss> Although some of the prose is repetitive, it helps instill a spiritual base on which the reader can pull from. <sssss> A definite pppppppppp quot;must have pppppppppp quot; book for the gay tribe who would like to interact spiritually and emotionally
Ranch Girl		The Sinister Pig CD: Books: Tony Hillerman,Guidall George		1		If Tony Hillerman wrote this novel (novella actually), I sure can't tell. <sssss> I have been a Chee/Leaphorn fan for many years, but this novel is not in the same league with Hillerman's other work. <sssss> It is reminiscent of a 'B' movie. <sssss> Instead of building suspense, the plot is laid out all too plainly, the characters are unreal, and the Chee/Bernie romance doesn't ring true. <sssss> I am amazed that it was published
Novel Reader "just a review . . ."		Late Great Planet Earth, The: Books: Mr. Hal Lindsey,Carole C. Carlson,Hal Lindsey		1		Many reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. <sssss> (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) <sssss> If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault. <sssss> Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. <sssss> After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. <sssss> We were searching and seeking. <sssss> We didn't have all of the facts. <sssss> There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. <sssss> Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'. <sssss> For most of us, our minds matured. <sssss> We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. <sssss> We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others. <sssss> This is beyond dangerous. <sssss> It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out. <sssss> I love a good horror novel. <sssss> I love a good 'true crime' thriller. <sssss> But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined. <sssss> That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. <sssss> The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. <sssss> Please don't be the next sucker. <sssss> Please don't add this one to your cart.
Charlie Lomax, Turning Pages Book Club		Million Little Pieces: Books: James Frey		1		This book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if James Frey did not repeat himself a million times. <sssss> Although, the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive. <sssss> This book however, did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox. <sssss> He could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing -up, and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out; even though his tactic was to show how brave he was, the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind! <sssss> This book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late, like it almost was for James. <sssss> It was just an okay book and we hope James Frey's next book will be much more interesting
A Reader		Lady Chatterley's Lover: Books: D. H. Lawrence		1		I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French pppppppppp Italians got their reputations as great lovers. <sssss> Is this the best that English literature can give us? <sssss> This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality. <sssss> It's also mean-spirited. <sssss> Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. <sssss> This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. <sssss> He drips way too much contempt. <sssss> Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. <sssss> Attempting to derive enjoyment from the "mental life" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of "woman" or "man"; and so on. <sssss> Looking at Italian art is stupid. <sssss> Everything in Paris is stupid. <sssss> Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly. <sssss> Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's "wrong" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing "that kind" of happiness as delusional and druglike. <sssss> He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. <sssss> Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. <sssss> This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward "druglike" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical. <sssss> Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. <sssss> This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. <sssss> Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a "user", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. <sssss> (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a "user".) <sssss> It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. <sssss> Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex. <sssss> This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. <sssss> Lawrence clearly defines a "real" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples. <sssss> A woman who lays there "unfeeling" is clearly an example. <sssss> Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. <sssss> Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character. <sssss> On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. <sssss> Bertha just had a sick (!) <sssss> urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. <sssss> The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he "spoilt" her. <sssss> As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? <sssss> Forget it. <sssss> Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. <sssss> A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. <sssss> Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later. <sssss> These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and "perform". <sssss> All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. <sssss> The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. <sssss> Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part. <sssss> Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men "want to hear". <sssss> This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being "sexist". <sssss> The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not "come to the crisis" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man. <sssss> It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. <sssss> For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as "intimacy" and "connection", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. <sssss> If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child. <sssss> So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman "should" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance. <sssss> There's a lot of talk of "tenderness" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow "lacking tenderness" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. <sssss> The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find. <sssss> I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. <sssss> I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible. <sssss> For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. <sssss> It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. <sssss> Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. <sssss> As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. <sssss> Obviously some people enjoy this book. <sssss> (Equally obviously, I did not.
dairyqueen		The Unprocessed Child: Living Without School: Books: Valerie Fitzenreiter		1		As a strong proponent of attachment parenting and a rather radical unschooler, this book was a BIG disappointment!!! <sssss> I bought this book after reading the reviews and wish I hadn't paid more than $1 for it. <sssss> While the title "The Unprocessed Child" accurately describes Laurie's upbringing, this book shouldn't be grouped with other unschooling literature. <sssss> The author, while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter, reminds me of the mother in "Love You Forever" who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son's room at night to spend time with him--sweet but a bit creepy. <sssss> The fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with Laurie pretty much says it all. <sssss> The mother clearly has her own issues that I hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she's not spending 24/7 with her only child. <sssss> We have been unschooling each of our four children since birth --challenging temperments and all--and I feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them. <sssss> If you want to read a GOOD book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter, I would recommend "Homeschooling our Children, Unschooling Ourselves". <sssss> Those authors offer more balance and eloquence than Ms. Fitzenreiter.
David Caplan "Dave C."		My Life in the Middle Ages: A Survivor's Tale: Books: James Atlas		1		He gave it all he had, but there just wasn't much of interest there. <sssss> He's a self-described, turmoiled loser, and not very interesting one to boot. <sssss> Kafka, Roth, and Jeremy Leven (Satan, et al), write about similar troubled Jews, and are much funnier and interesting. <sssss> I like his honesty, but, it's not worth the price of admission
D. C. Mcmanus "disappointed"		Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Books: T. Harv Eker		1		Never received the book, so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost I have incurred
N. Bachor "gaelicgranny"		For Women Only: What You Need to Know About the Inner Lives of Men: Books: Shaunti Feldhahn		2		This is a must read for EVERY woman married or single who desires to have a better relationship with the men in their lives. <sssss> We all have men in our lives husband, father, brother, son, friend or coworker with whom the relationship is worth improving. <sssss> Keep in mind this is neither a marriage book nor a psychology book. <sssss> It is a book about men written for the women who truly care about them and the relationships they have with men. <sssss> There is a companion book written about women for men appropriately titled, "For Men Only." <sssss> Perhaps those who were offended by this book should give that one a try. <sssss> I found this book to be both touching and challenging. <sssss> Very Good book!! <sssss> !
owlnight "piano man"		The Complete Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales: Books: Brothers Grimm		1		Who published these weak translations? <sssss> Yup, they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately. <sssss> How about using real paper? <sssss> B pppppppppp N needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality
Renee Airington "Complex Kid"		Colonize This!: Young Women of Color on Today's Feminism (Live Girls Series): Books: Daisy Hernandez,Bushra Rehman		2		To think about racism is to be thoughtful. <sssss> To be thoughtful is to be engaged in the process of learning. <sssss> To refuse to reflect on and examine your belief systems is to be ignorant
Ken Walsh		Beating the Street: Books: Peter Lynch,John Rothchild		1		Not all that useful, really. <sssss> Message is "buy mutual funds!". <sssss> In general, since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market, just buy index funds would be the best advice. <sssss> Most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks. <sssss> Passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the CEO to go over the financials and confirm your valuation. <sssss> Oh, thanks Peter, what great advice... ("Mr. Gates, your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares")
A. Garnier "murder mystery fan"		The 5th Horseman: Books: James Patterson,Maxine Paetro,Carolyn McCormick		1		I enjoyed the first 3 books of the Women's Murder Club. <sssss> Didn't like too much the 4th (of July), but the 5th is just BAD ! <sssss> What's the plot ? <sssss> There is no plot ! <sssss> 2 serial-killer stories try to share the pages of this not-such-a-page-turner, the 1st mystery (Car Girls) get solved mid-way throught the book and I bet plenty of readers won't remember it by the end of this painfull read... By trying to develop 2 stories, Patterson gets our interest for none. <sssss> The most sad thing of all is that I used to like to Women's Murder Club members, but now they all seem so unreal, remote from anything actually likeable. <sssss> And it's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club, in the most stupid, artificial way really. <sssss> Not much to save this book, it's even badly written. <sssss> Don't know if Patterson thinks about writting a 6th, but don't count on me next time
G. Reid		Atlas of World History: Books: Patrick K. O'Brien		2		The Oxford Atlas is the best of all competitors. <sssss> It is full-size, high quality ink and paper, 368 pages and covers most areas of history from the caveman to the present time. <sssss> I am not speaking of the concise edition but of the full-size edition. <sssss> The ISBN number is #0195215672. <sssss> This book covers about 2,000,000 years of history from the origins of humanity to the year 2000. <sssss> The Atlas is the result of over three years' work by internationally renowned cartographers, an expert editorial team and specialist academic consultants
Sharon Wylie		Second Sight: Books: Amanda Quick		1		I really love Amanda Quick, but this one just didn't work. <sssss> We don't even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together; the action starts after they've already spent a week getting to know each other. <sssss> Very disappointing from a romance novel. <sssss> And I don't really expect tightly woven mysteries in my romance novels, but the plot in this one defies belief. <sssss> It's never explained why the first murder even occurs. <sssss> The hero's fear that the murderer will focus on Venetia because she's using the last name "Jones" is beyond ludicrous. <sssss> If that was going to be a major plot point, at least make it an unusual name that would link the hero and heroine together. <sssss> But JONES?! <sssss> All would be forgiven if the romance were compelling, but it wasn't in the slightest. <sssss> I will probably choose to wait for the next one in paperback or at the library
Joseph A. Maciulla		The Six Sigma Handbook: The Complete Guide for Greenbelts, Blackbelts, and Managers at All Levels, Revised and Expanded Edition: Books: Thomas Pyzdek		2		This book is a must have for anyone applying six sigma to real world problems. <sssss> Not only do I use it on a nearly daily basis, I'm finding that my engineers are embracing the terminology and concepts so clearly conveyed in this text. <sssss> We're spending 20-minutes at each staff meeting to review topics from basic statistics to advanced application of teaming concepts to get results. <sssss> Instead of the usual soft stuff application examples that seem to illustrate that the author thinks everyone's making clothes pins, Pyzdek's book shows that he's really lived this stuff. <sssss> I highly recommend this book to anyone serious about applying six sigma for results. <sssss> Joe Maciulla Manager, Manufacturing Engineering Systems Raytheon Missile System
booksforabuck "BooksForABuck.com"		Not a Girl Detective : A Cece Caruso Mystery: Books: Susan Kandel		2		Mystery-writer biographer Cece Caruso is in the midst of book on Nancy Drew author "Carolyn Keene" (actually a pseudonym for numerous authors) when her bookstore-owner friends ask her to deliver a vintage Nancy Drew book to collector Edgar Edwards. <sssss> Cece is more than happy for an excuse to meet the eccentric millionaire collector. <sssss> They strike up an immediate friendship, and after showing her his collection, he shows her something really special--a nude portrait of the model who posed for the original Nancy Drew covers. <sssss> Cece is scheduled to give a luncheon speech at a Nancy Drew convention in nearby Palm Springs, and Edward invites her to use his vacation house there. <sssss> Delighted at her good fortune, Cece packs up herself and her two friends, Lael and Bridget, a boatload of vintage clothes (which she collects, though she told Edgar she collected nothing) and head for a fun girls' weekend. <sssss> Unfortunately, someone throws a kink into their plans--a big kink. <sssss> A dead body. <sssss> Edgar's body. <sssss> The suspects are many, including Edgar's boy-toy friend and his majordomo; a wild-eyed Nancy Drew fanatic who wouldn't have wanted that nude painting made public; her less-than-honest, performance artist daughter; Bridget's new boy-toy boyfriend; a shi-shi art dealer. <sssss> And, of course, Cece herself, who could have endeared herself to the police had she not insisted on solving the mystery herself. <sssss> But her curiosity about the model in the nude painting, the artist who did the painting, and anything connected to Nancy Drew gets the better of her. <sssss> The second in the Cece Caruso series is a fun, fast-paced puzzler, and Cece and her "chums" give Nancy a run for her money. <sssss> The Nancy Drew trivia is fascinating, and the many references to vintage clothing makes me want to learn more. <sssss> My one beef--Cece leaves town, twice, and stays gone for hours on end without making arrangements for anyone to take care of her dog and cat. <sssss> I mean, maybe she did make arrangements, but if it was mentioned, I missed it.
Russell J. DeFord "russbeck99"		Song of Susannah (The Dark Tower, Book 6): Books: Stephen King,George Guidall		1		This is perhaps the most disappointing King book I have ever read (and considering that I have read "Desperation" and "Insomnia" that is saying a lot). <sssss> The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story. <sssss> I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top. <sssss> The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book. <sssss> I thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book. <sssss> I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of "The Green Mile: Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I'll read my junk mail. <sssss> I cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery
adrienne herbert		The Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen: Books: Donna Klein		2		I'm not even a vegetarian , let alone a vegan, and this book offers such flavorful and simple recipes. <sssss> Some more time consuming than others but definitely worth the wait! <sssss> Unless you hate veggies, this book is a must have! <sssss> I just made the Herb Scalloped potatoes as a side dish and the author was right, it's hard to believe there's no cheese or cream! <sssss> the pizza with caramelized onions, kalmata olives and tomatoes is fantastic too!. <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> .lots of yummyness
Jason Hurd "Kitsula"		The Cosmic Serpent: Books: Jeremy Narby		1		Jeremy Narby's The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge, started out decently enough with Narby reminiscing about his days doing field work in the Amazon Basin and from there he goes over some interesting ideas regarding DNA and Serpent Myths but then all goes down hill as he suddenly becomes a follower of Intelligent Design and makes an all out attack on Darwinian Evolution and Science itself. <sssss> A number of Narby's ideas regarding DNA and Shamanism are intriguing enough but he has apparently decided that all Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology, while he freely admits that he is being very reductionist on this point, I still see many problems with his view that Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology at heart. <sssss> His argument mostly surrounds the symbol of the Serpent/Dragon which is present in many different mythologies often with connections to water and associations with twins. <sssss> He decides that this is in actually a representation of DNA as viewed by Shamans and believes that all serpents in mythology and shamanic visions are actually DNA. <sssss> Since DNA emits photons and this has been shown to possibly play a part in cell communication (along with the traditional chemical communication) Narby believes that in shamanic trances the shaman becomes able to see the light emitted by DNA (which often show up as snakes) and the shaman communicates with the individual bits of DNA (which is conscious) and the entire linked network of DNA based life. <sssss> As justification for this argument he points out that some groups hold that spirits are beings of pure light, to him this is almost literally correct as the spirits are actually DNA and communicate through light as "spirits". <sssss> From there he goes on to say that all ladders, staircases, and ropes in shamanic quests are representations of DNA and when the shaman uses them he is travelling along DNA and similarly when the shaman goes to the underworld he is sinking down to the world of Molecular Biology (although since one can apparently work with and see DNA in the middle world one must ask why one would need to shrink down). <sssss> While these views might make for some interesting theological discussion about some shamanic practices, Narby seems to have ignored the psychological aspects of visions and quests and any elements other than snakes or other things that just happen to be long and thin. <sssss> Given Narby's view of spirits as DNA one must ask what spiritual helpers/allies are? <sssss> Is someone's spiritual guides DNA in some bacteria on my hand? <sssss> Will I kill Yahweh by washing my hands with anti-bacterial soap (hey maybe that's why Jesus decided that washing one's hands was bad!)? <sssss> A lot of his proof is like the proof of Erich von D?niken except that where D?niken saw aliens and spacecraft, Narby sees DNA and Molecules. <sssss> Take for example this D?niken-esque proof from the book: "The second was a rock painting of the Rainbow Snake. <sssss> I looked at it more closely and saw two things: All around the serpent there were sorts of chromosomes, in their upside-down "U" shape, and underneath it there was a kind of ladder!" <sssss> (p. 79) By Chapter 10, entitled Biology's Blind Spot, Narby has decided that Evolution is Wrong and all of Science must be toppled. <sssss> This bit seems to have come out of nowhere like someone spliced a Pro-Intelligent Design rant into a book where it didn't belong and as with all Pro-ID and Creationist literature we get the same old faulty attacks again and again. <sssss> Attacks such as Evolution being based on a Circular argument because the most fit species survive to spread their genes and therefore are more fit. <sssss> Yes, that is the definition of fitness, and sometimes the basis of things start as tautologies such as the Theory of Gravity but like Gravity Natural Selection and evolution is justified and testable by looking at it's predictive power. <sssss> Population genetics and mathematics shows clearly that natural selection is very predictive and has so far not been falsified. <sssss> Similarly, we can also look at the fossil record in geological strata for evidence of evolutionary change over time. <sssss> After that attack Narby then attacks the Central Dogma (Which is how transcription of DNA to proteins works) by misinterpreting what Francis Crick meant. <sssss> Crick never meant the word Dogma in Central Dogma to be taken in the sense it is used in religion instead he meant it as a joke name for a grand hypothesis that he had at the time little actual experimental evidence for. <sssss> Narby misinterprets Crick's joke to argue that evolution is apparently Faith based, since this argument has no basis in reality it falls flat immediately. <sssss> He then argues that ants and other animals are fully conscious because they do amazing things that seem to require forethought and they tap into DNA like shamans to do things. <sssss> Higher animals are smart and may have consciousness but ants are pretty dumb. <sssss> One is reminded of Edward Selous and others' ideas about thought-transference to explain how flocks of birds move and how ants and termites build hives, as it turns out birds flocking behaviour operates on simple instinctual rules (clustering, maintaining speed, and appropriate distance) and so are Ant Nesting behaviours. <sssss> One proof of this is to put food just out of the reach of ants, and some dirt underneath, while they understand how to move earth and tunnel they will never purposely move earth to build ramps, bridges, or tunnels to reach a goal. <sssss> The birds who flew in flocks and the ancestors of ants who had developed nesting behaviour managed to survive better and so these behaviours somehow became instincts and persisted. <sssss> Now Narby makes the extremely tired argument that life is too complicated to be determined by chance alone, and he is correct on this matter. <sssss> Too bad there is more than chance guiding evolution, we also have Natural Selection guiding the process, to quote Richard Dawkins: "Life results from the non-random survival of randomly varying replicators." <sssss> The combinations which work survive and prosper and are kept in the population. <sssss> Narby argues "How can a small telephone directory of information emerge from random processes?" <sssss> (P. 142) to answer this I wish to quote a bit of Michael Shermer's 25 Creationists' Arguments and 25 Evolutionists' Answers which nicely illustrates how natural selection can produce Shakespeare's Hamlet quickly from random letters: "Natural selection is not "random" nor does it operate by "chance." <sssss> Natural selection preserves the gains and eradicates the mistakes. <sssss> The eye evolved from a single, light-sensitive cell into the complex eye of today through hundreds if not thousands of intermediate steps, many of which still exist in nature. <sssss> In order for the monkey to type the first 13 letters of Hamlet's soliloquy by chance, it would take 26 to the power of 13 number of trials for success. <sssss> This is 16 times as great as the total number of seconds that have elapsed in the lifetime of the solar system. <sssss> But if each correct letter is preserved and each incorrect letter eradicated, the process operates much faster. <sssss> How much faster? <sssss> Richard Hardison constructed a computer program in which letters were "selected" for or against, and it took an average of only 335.2 trials to produce the sequence of letters TOBEORNOTTOBE. <sssss> This takes the computer less than 90 seconds. <sssss> The entire play can be done in about 4.5 days!" <sssss> Narby also tries to argue that gaps in the fossil record such as in whale evolution and other places where there are few or no intermediate forms indicate that evolution has not occurred. <sssss> This however just means that in this instance there are gaps in the fossil record because the fossils have not been found yet. <sssss> Narby also points to the seemingly rapid appearance of species in the fossil record as an argument against evolution. <sssss> Apparently Narby has never heard of Punctuated Equilibrium. <sssss> Narby stunningly also tries to argue that because large portions of DNA is identical over many different species that this somehow indicates design, unfortunately for Narby a lot of these identical sequences of DNA code for the basic processes of life. <sssss> A human who couldn't cope with oxygen or a fox which could not metabolize energy would not last long in this world. <sssss> The fact that these sequences are identical is actually a point for evolution because the same processes have been preserved and we even see similar basic skeletal structures in animals even when it is not efficient or useful such as digits in the fins of dolphins or the appendix in humans. <sssss> Finally, we come back full circle to his argument about Natural Selection being a form of circular logic and he ties to paint Evolution as unfalsifiable (No, we can test it's predictions in such fields as Genetics and Palaeontology) and being denounce by an increasing number of scientists (not at all true). <sssss> All in all while Narby has some interesting nuggets of information and ideas in The Cosmic Serpent he ultimately seems to squander these ideas by jumping around in random directions and to strange conclusions based on very little evidence
Midwest Book Review		Mapping Security: The Corporate Security Sourcebook for Today's Global Economy (Symantec Press): Books: Tom Patterson,Scott Gleeson Blue		2		Written by a senior business advisor in the fields of security, commerce, and governance with a senior strategist and communications consultant, Mapping Security: The Corporate Sourcebook For Today's Global Economy outlines how companies of today and tomorrow can effectively protect themselves against threats, remain fully accountable, and stay within the rules outlined by a hedgemony of global regulations. <sssss> Detailed nation-by-nation drill downs on security in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Americas, and the Asia-Pacific region are particularly helpful in framing what to expect and how to prepare for it. <sssss> Written in plain terms, Mapping Security is a vital resource for leaders in any multinational business, especially in today's complex world inhabited customers of diverse cultural backgrounds, not to mention increasingly savvy thieves and worse.
JAMES A BROWN JR		Zero Defect Hiring: A Quick Guide to the Most Important Decisions Managers Have to Make: Books: Walter Anthony Dinteman		2		This book provides an excellent guide to finding and hiring the right people for your organization. <sssss> If the procedures outlined here are learned and followed, one can be certain of consistently better hiring decisions in the future
apisano6		Dance of the Gods (The Circle Trilogy, Book 2): Books: Nora Roberts,Dick Hill		2		Very good book. <sssss> She did it again, draws you in so you can relate to all characters and their issues. <sssss> Book 2 stayed interesting continuously. <sssss> Looking forward to Book 3
Scissorhand36		The Butcher's Theater: Books: Jonathan Kellerman		2		This was the very first Jonathan Kellerman book I had ever read. <sssss> This is by far the best one he ever wrote. <sssss> I don't think that I have ever read a book so riveting and suspensful. <sssss> It's like watching a top notch horror/mystery movie. <sssss> This has got to be my most favorite book of any by anyone. <sssss> I still recommend it to people after reading it quite a few years ago now. <sssss> I give this book a 5++++ star rating
Kim		Barrel Fever: Stories and Essays: Books: David Sedaris		2		This collection of stories and essays by David Sedaris definitely contains a lot of variety. <sssss> Overall, I found the way the stories were dripping with sarcasm delightful. <sssss> Some stories were a bit dry, but others such as "SantaLand Diaries" and "Diary of a Smoker" had me laughing out load. <sssss> However, the best stories I found were the ones such "Season's Greetings to our Friends and Family!!!" <sssss> which I had to think about before fully understanding and laughing at their humor. <sssss> I would definitely like to read more of Sedaris' works, especially those based on his real-life experiences as, overall, I found the collection of essays in this book more entertaining than the stories
L. Miller "Lysis"		Constantine: Books: John Shirley		1		There were several good scenes, but they didn't make up for the rest of the book. <sssss> Not worth reading.
Paula Erickson "pse71"		The English Patient: Books: Michael Ondaatje,Michael York		1		I am an avid reader, and I will finish a book no matter how difficult it is, or how boring it is, and I couldn't finish this one. <sssss> It was so dry - and I couldn't connect with any of the characters. <sssss> I was really disappointed
Phillip W. Rodes Jr.		Notebook: Books: Nicholas Sparks		2		This book was wonderful. <sssss> The rich grandeur of the south is alive in this story of unimaginable dedication and love. <sssss> This book had me teared up more than a few times. <sssss> Kobe Bryant bought his wife a million dollar ring, Noah simply wrote a notebook and read from it. <sssss> Read this book and you will know why True Love cannot be bought, duplicated, or imitated with money. <sssss> philli
Frogman		By the Light of the Moon: Books: Dean Koontz		1		The work of a 12 year-old without talent. <sssss> Phrases are tediously cobbled with clumsy, inappropriate similies. <sssss> Story line is absurd. <sssss> If this were Koontz's first novel, no publisher would touch it
james bien		Tramp: The Life of Charlie Chaplin: Books: Joyce Milton		1		I was at first rather impressed by the epic size of the book thinking it must contain something new about the comedian. <sssss> Well, I was wrong. <sssss> It was long, tedious and nasty. <sssss> Granted, Chaplin was not perfect, but the author's preoccupation with his imperfections borders on sickening. <sssss> A better title for this book would be 'Trash, what I think of Charlie'. <sssss> Joyce Milton would do well writing for tabloids..
		Coach K's Little Blue Book, Revised and Updated: Lessons From College Basketball's Best Coach: Books: Barry Jacobs		1		I got this book thinking it might give me some insight into how Coach K motivates his teams, organizes his practice sessions, and instills leadership qualities in his athletes. <sssss> What I got was a less than thrilling re-hash of some of his best quotes as seen through the eyes of a local news reporter. <sssss> You'd have to be a true Blue Devil fan to like this book. <sssss> I didn't, so I gave it to one of my co-workers who graduated from Duke. <sssss> He likes it
FantasyFan		Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6): Books: J.K. Rowling,Mary GrandPr?		1		J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book. <sssss> The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated. <sssss> I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way. <sssss> In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day. <sssss> Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. <sssss> Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done. <sssss> This book Harry seemed to care more about romance. <sssss> A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books. <sssss> A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion. <sssss> Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story. <sssss> Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence. <sssss> The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another. <sssss> The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy. <sssss> As to the general plot of the book. <sssss> Poorly done. <sssss> Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me. <sssss> Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything. <sssss> My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization. <sssss> A very disappointing book
wiredweird "wiredweird"		30 Days of Night: Books: Steve Niles,Ben Templesmith		2		Not great, maybe, but good. <sssss> The theme is vampire - the creatures that feed by night on their human cattle. <sssss> But what if the night goes on and on? <sssss> Good suspense, good characters and development, and an artistic style that carries the mood. <sssss> It's a nightmarish visual style and a limited palette (black, white, and blood red), but it works. <sssss> Recommended. <sssss> //wiredweir
Donna Delaune "donnaread"		The Twelfth Card (A Lincoln Rhyme Novel): Books: Jeffery Deaver		1		I'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with. <sssss> However, my public library has a limited selection of audio books, so I take what I can get. <sssss> I am a voracious reader, and I listen to audios to get more "reading" in, as you can listen and do other things. <sssss> I much prefer the Lillian Jackson Braun "cat" books, at least there is some humor, and I like the "mystery" part of these books better than Deaver's. <sssss> Sorry to all the Deaver fan's out there...I HAVE enjoyed a few of his books, but I get tired of the "same ole-same ole"
		Bird: Books: Angela Johnson		1		this book hardly has any conversation in it and hardly goes into detail about anything. <sssss> i didn't even like the story. <sssss> i would give this book a big fat ZERO if i could! <sssss> !
T. Crane		Transfer of Power: Books: Vince Flynn		1		Flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story. <sssss> Unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays Flynn's political preferences. <sssss> Characters, like Rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the "real world" works. <sssss> Meanwhile, Flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are Democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election. <sssss> While there are grains of truth in his characters, Flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype. <sssss> I was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller. <sssss> I'm still looking.
Karen S. Guard "Karen"		The giving tree: Books: Shel Silverstein		1		This is a childrens book and it is supposed to teach a positive message. <sssss> It should have been tiltled the "jewish Mother " tree or something. <sssss> So the message was Use me and use me and use me some more and after I'm all used up, use me some more and I will be happy. <sssss> Thats something we want to convey to children
Jerry Miller		The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America: Books: Jonathan Kozol,Harry Chase		2		This is what happens when uneducated reactionaries dictate to a concept that is beyond their comprehension. <sssss> It's just more sanke oil from the same pigs who gave us the scams of deregulation (capitalism governing itself), privatization (the giveaway of what our taxes bought to those who pay little or no tax), and globalization (repositioning the Republican Party to a time predating the Emancipation Proclamation). <sssss> Hitler and Mussolini would certainly approve
Kendall Soulen		How to Manage Your Dick: Redirect Sexual Energy and Discover Your More Spiritually Enlightened, Evolved Self: Books: Sean O'Reilly		1		This books seems interesting until you learn (within a few pages) that the author forbids masturbation at any time and basically sees sex as a crude animal instinct. <sssss> If you're a big Bill Bennett fan you might enjoy this, but for those inerested in developing a little more restraint while still participating to some small degree in modernity, look elsewhere. <sssss> BTW, Mr. O'Reilly, the world is NOT a more brutish place than ever before. <sssss> Sad, to say, it's almost certainly less so.
Jason C. Wotherspoon		Stock Trader's Almanac 2004 (Stock Trader's Almanac): Books: Jeffrey A. Hirsch,Yale Hirsch		2		If you want to buy the book, go ahead, just be careful of superbookdeals, they take your money but don't deliver and don't answer emails. <sssss> Caveat Emptor
David Fry		Familiars: Books: Kristine Kathryn Rusch,Jody Lyn Nye,P.N. Elrod,Von Jocks,Andre Norton,Laura Anne Gilman,Josepha Sherman,Michelle West,Denise Little		1		I ordered this book and read most of it in the hope that I would learn something about Familiars . <sssss> In the interval between ordering and receiving my sixth sense made me begin to have doubts about Ms Little . <sssss> Had she flown about the battlements of an old castle in the form of an Owl? <sssss> Had she entertained A Hyrax or a Feral Cat as a house guest ? <sssss> Had she ever had a pet Bat living behind a picture in the living room ? <sssss> Was she acquainted with the properties of Henbane and twylight sleep and did she number Hecate among her close friends? <sssss> The kindest thing , I thought was to suggest that Ms Little Knew as much about Familiars as I know about Conveyancing or Futures Trading , and let it go at that
todd shampoe		Outlaw Mountain: A Joanna Brady Mystery: Books: J.A. Jance		1		Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow. <sssss> It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender. <sssss> But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd. <sssss> Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. <sssss> If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you. <sssss> It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle. <sssss> Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. <sssss> Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time. <sssss> If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely
David Stump		Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament: Books: Christopher J. H. Wright		2		in order to properly understand the Jesus of the new testament, instead of making a Jesus of our own liking, it is necessary to understand Jesus as he himself indicated. <sssss> Jesus himself, according to the new testament, made constant reference and allusion to the hebrew scriptures, ( old testament ), as he sought to explain himself, his actions, his teachings and his significance. <sssss> Understanding the old testament is therefore of paramount importance for understanding what Jesus was and is about. <sssss> This means far more than knowing some of the messianic proof texts or knowing about Noahs ark or the temple and sacrificial system of the ancient hebrews. <sssss> Understanding the old testament involves knowing the overall aim and purpose of it, and how it all is held together by connected themes that form a unified whole. <sssss> Christopher Wright's book, Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament, is an absolute Godsend towards getting the drift of the old testament and how it carries forward to the Jesus of the new testament. <sssss> This book is a little bit technical at times, it is not a devotional work, but reading this book will educate a person to accurately understand what the old testament is about and how it flows into the person of Jesus, thereby expositing the true meaning and intent of Jesus according to the background that Jesus himself referred to. <sssss> Thanks Chris Wright for this fabulous book. <sssss> Also see his forthcoming book, The Mission of God, due out in fall of 2006 by intervarsity press. <sssss> It looks to be another bullseye!! <sssss> For some other great little books on Jesus that are sane and sober, see: Jesus and His World by Peter Walker, The Original Jesus by N.T. <sssss> Wright, and for a bit of a larger work see Jesus and The Gospels by Craig Blomberg
Helen Lightfoot "morgansky"		Suze Orman Will pppppppppp Trust Kit: Books: Suze Orman		1		If you want a VERY simple will or a VERY simple living will or power of attorney for health care, this program will work for you. <sssss> However, it offers only a very narrow range of options for personalizing the generic forms included in the package. <sssss> I disliked this program so much that I threw the whole package in the trash.
W. W. Sperger "zak attack"		Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster: Books: Jon Krakauer		2		After reading this account of the acension of Everest, you gotta wonder why anybody would want to. <sssss> Is it really worth it ? <sssss> For the thrill seaking personality, of course it is. <sssss> For normal people, forget about it. <sssss> Even if you aren't into climbing mountains, this book is gripping from page to page and you don't want to put it down. <sssss> Krakauer's first (?) <sssss> book - "Into the Wild" is also great but this one is better, being a first person account. <sssss> I remember when this came out and the surrounding backlash that accompanied it from people associated to the dead. <sssss> Forget them, Krakauer get's it right, with no hidden agenda, unless you count surviving. <sssss> I would have liked more commentary from the surviving members, though. <sssss> And not to state the obvious to everyone else but me but why do they leave the bodies on the mountain ? <sssss> They risk their lives to rescue the affirmed or injured living but once they're dead, they just leave them there ? <sssss> What's up with that ?
