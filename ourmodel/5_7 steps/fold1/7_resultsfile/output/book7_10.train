Wadood Murshedkar		Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order: Books: Robert Kagan		1		 <sssss> OF AND Americans are from and Europeans are from apart from simply caught a few line this author by Robert Kagan of Of And has not only attention the many of but managed to up a of among the and concerned relations with <sssss> introduced thought Kagan 's became book popular extremely and received international analysis for its relationship of the not to mention its and throughout the yet book <sssss> Kagan chapters book in his in order to issues the key claims which he are of the ever US between and Europe <sssss> starts chapter In the The Kagan War from World understand I to the Europe military towards and <sssss> He that while both the World Europe helped they US the power as a <sssss> He further might on the US of the chapter in the that of and <sssss> explains Kagan how lack power of can not only and but change as well <sssss> claims He Europe 's power of military it to only not but them and together all try at the same time and force the US by world a which is methods by economic and <sssss> chapter This into chapter a discusses which in Kagan details of and failure Europe 's and America 's in situation the <sssss> presents He finally argument his central chapters in the The and The World America states where Kagan evolution Europe 's state into its present under the of the U.S. security and could not have it without <sssss> on Europe 's Kagan argument his on the growing Europe of and questions It the terms of such as chapter in his Is Still The <sssss> seems Finally it provides Kagan solution a problem to this US of the Europe chapter in his to by simply line one is task the Europeans for both and Americans to reality to the new of American <sssss> needs book This small extremely as issue compared to the it analysis further and some close <sssss> are There issues many to be analysis in Kagan 's brief and one might not be completely claims with certain or manner the which in topic such a and is <sssss> is While there tone a bias of in opinion to the general view of a that author the Kagan miss to out facts some and mention not to present and lacks essay the <sssss> point start To with let me out the arguments in Kagan 's the which of highly claims his reader the in a argument of either <sssss> claims Kagan Europe 's has interest a European powerful building in world a matter where military and power hard less power than economic and rules behavior of pg <sssss> goes He on say to natural lack Since Europeans the to actions military either or Europe as it is that they should others do to do that they can not themselves <sssss> has pg in to Europe today wealth the and make to wanted itself more power of a world terms in military if Europe become to kind that power of world <sssss> Kagan puts views his own times many weak that Europe is nor does have it the build to up forces its yet time at the same forth argument an of Europe 's of spending its and might military to US the <sssss> chapter In the of and claim Kagan 's one another made which is chapter in the next seem as reasoning the claims for both his to be absolutely <sssss> explains He first due Europe 's for is to its and past the which from it has <sssss> explains He then it giving by example the man of a with a and one the same with a having different of the word when a pg <sssss> Kagan But again feels himself become Europe can power a military as and when it to says when he spend They could easily much as spending as they are on believed if they necessary it do to so pg <sssss> forces So this me ask to question a would one be by a produce if one could a to this <sssss> possible So is n't it quite feel that Europeans they not because enjoy the free gotten they have under the American security decades over the past six pg but was rather because there and is no real all at <sssss> seems use With the of such as The of and States pg uses which Kagan describe to Iraq and Iran mention not to references his to of uses which he as a war to the Iraq in seem which still to be reason for some he to me by his own <sssss> want While Kagan that Iraq was a and US the it one as did while Europe not he might explain to as to why in he Kagan was the of the for the New American document a which American of the of Iraq from or Iran <sssss> States The United has decades for play to role a more security in <sssss> provides While conflict the Iraq with the need the for a American force in the issue the of the of perspective From an American value the of such would pass even should scene from the <sssss> prove term the long Iran may well as large a to U.S. in the has as Iraq <sssss> improve And even should relations forces region in the would still be an essential in U.S. security given the American region in the <sssss> forces pg America 's 1 * This me to either that author the has picking to evidence of or he from <sssss> seem Some reasoning of his analysis and to be too <sssss> justify When action military one can not it saying by start have When you a problems all look to like <sssss> author The nation about the 's US 's go to war to has simply because it ability the and the do to so <sssss> seems need a or reasons use for the of author the content to be in use force of has simply because one it <sssss> aspects aspect One important leaves Kagan out analysis in his are the political and of the <sssss> note discussed While I have review later aspects some in the one must mention that Kagan does not the apart from 's it of pg <sssss> created The US from the had problems serious and between the two * 2 <sssss> seem were While there issues many other that further fire the growing over the example for which Kagan under the needed to be if one is relations * 3 4 book For a covers which issues from the World War going back philosophy to ancient issues to the present which from many are simply examples for see notes 20 low to be especially with the ones of some important and mention not to certain which facts to historical <sssss> mentions Kagan some As put Europeans it the real of States of the United making the and doing Europeans the the pg yet he does not source to any statement for this <sssss> says He believed majority The vast Europeans of always that the if any by was more risk than the of him along with other is like The and Iraq of 's what they Europe pg and gives again source no for the beliefs of these <sssss> he one claims of his by note in his pg found matter for that this is also view the in American <sssss> expect One might not generally see to evidence such analysis in a relations of <sssss> Kagan times at back times to and has strong essay in his <sssss> mentions He number a times of see how Americans world the perspective from a while Europeans are of <sssss> seems Kagan to have fact the that described though had state the nature of that as all of all against the only reason is a to peace earth on <sssss> Kagan theory flawed itself was as later it as justify to American no but where theory in ' is justified by the <sssss> are There conclusions some Kagan seem which beliefs to be of an American living world in a pure where politics is as religion as <sssss> He that while US the was security free Europe to War after the power America 's great and to for other given pg has Europe opportunity the build to up <sssss> Kagan further point his says when he spend America 's spend to money much so them Europeans would rather money their own on social long and pg <sssss> These are facts of which are more of bias <sssss> like I would put to forth points two in order to the of these two <sssss> was First interest America 's Europe in not provide to it security with before whether or War after the <sssss> One must not fact the that taken to the was for rather than benefit for the of eye which were under the of the Kagan himself fact the says when he free With check the power of the States the United was to chose and it <sssss> results when Kagan position that Europe has which a $ is in a support to its spending along with military fact the spends that Europe more on calls as he them analysis in a <sssss> seem mentioned When I had earlier chose that Kagan to and facts certain example the of the which author the has times many book in his would relevant most <sssss> one is issues of the primary discusses he bring to forth US and European <sssss> based American in or was not on interest of a American national is had While Americans interest a compelling moral in and had US the interest no national at in the pg this sees how Kagan it <sssss> was a but was it the only <sssss> seem While had much very to in stop to the none interested to have been offer in his wanted they rather complete and control all to of <sssss> reason The which to the note B an day on the last of the held Paris at one must was the primary for as it to its and <sssss> mention Yet he does not of to in 5 * <sssss> are thing Some missing book from Kagan 's entire America words the Latin and <sssss> believes seen As above Kagan spending America was money its Europe and Europe alone from all the world around the War before and after the War before and after the <sssss> is But what me to quite an does that once not mention Kagan about any American America in Latin or not or East the matter for that <sssss> aware Those aware who are well world of the them around will be support of America 's for and other America throughout Latin and the East far example for self which were for alone or it is that author the is that American the Latin and countries were a Europe to the and mention no them of <sssss> found A complete by can be on * 6 7 8 is There one put as I it which argument the entire book of this <sssss> results approach Kagan 's which power to the word terms only in of military and ultimately in a false which is the thesis for his <sssss> believes Kagan world the and left Europe in particular is with two follow that they either US the or audience be a <sssss> due reason The he conclusion this put as I it is view to his <sssss> says than US the as a down by Kagan realize leaders American should that they are hardly all at capable that Europe is not really of US the <sssss> He claim this book throughout his see - pg etc <sssss> author The 's facts about highly and relevant has to the claims of his <sssss> Kagan has errors serious here by Europe 's military not but political and indeed <sssss> population With a of * Book the and still growing the leave aside Europe can not be simply or aside as a dead or culture a <sssss> enough Europe is strong trouble to to wants US the as and when it problems the recent over the industry and more many have all much that Europe 's economic is of a US for the <sssss> believe point While I must out a I this is ' the single capable which is for all against thesis of Kagan 's and arguments and that is the American <sssss> mentioned Not once has he state the American of did even though problems exist wrote when he book this <sssss> seems He to be and that America can spending its US the can its current military spending and far its current future into the <sssss> were rate the growing trends showing the was of towards a believe I as author by the see for statistics * 10 <sssss> suggest Also solution Kagan 's final is that answer The obvious should that Europe and build up military its even if only leaves me with a <sssss> Is Kagan has that Europe military no all at or it is wants that he begin to a new time this War <sssss> writing understand Kagan must he is book this for international and simply not those whose are in his with <sssss> is doubt I disagree most would get that world the should into an here know as we all there no evil to this starts if it once <sssss> is discussed While I have already effects the trade of and economics which Kagan on the there something point I must out end before I review this <sssss> Kagan rather topic of the relationships which is to US fashion in a <sssss> writes agree While Americans most themselves would probably not with Kagan 's see as opinion the public and faith sources from various news 12 * leave aside Europeans or rest world of the Kagan pages almost justify to it <sssss> conclusion This was a disappointing rather book to his thinks where he solution the only to the ever is to <sssss> audience believe says When Kagan many how seem statistics to him Americans that by interest their they interest the humanity of sounds he and quotes to home the point he saying as cause cause America 's is the of all and bring again I must notice to author the 's the of these is an international which is has culture its own and beliefs religious and and has reason no believe to why culture their or beliefs are other to any <sssss> realize author An of his must relationships that it is and not a primary discussed that is being <sssss> seems While he take to saying in has that America attitude a go alone it pg it does not by the UN pg takes action of international pg justified is in pg fails he to the situation of the current day day or rather the wrote when he book this and the growing policy of American world around the <sssss> justified sees While he Europe as an path in the of America 's a would be more than in out be that may US it is the that and efforts of the to world a which international rights human opinion public and most all of peace <sssss> fails He give to an solution if not a complete to go world the of this as he essay his saying by understanding a little common can still way a long <sssss> have While many nothing words but praise of calls as a one line by it a and of America the 's and to Dr. Henry -LSB- been against whom of human right have terms who Kagan as a <sssss> See cases for 13 * list for of -RSB- * book the is a which would discussion the years for come to I do not particularly it it <sssss> put As I have already forth data show to lacks why book the evidence a reasoning argument or makes though prose its easy and its read it a good it barely deep problem into the or solution the apart from surface the surface the military <sssss> create book the did in the political due which was probably to
