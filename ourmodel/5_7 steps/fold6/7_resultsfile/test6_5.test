book This was I was writing with the and loved story the
So emotions many book in one
forward reading to more author from this
thrown I have never actually book a room across the in and love I books so this is
ahead read please do n't on read if you have n't book the
managed I get to somehow book through the first disliked which I I rest the novels of 's hard so this was me for and my and tried read to book this sequel the bought as I 'd it and looked it more
better It was put as reader one it first than the but book a depressing very and frustrating indeed
made angry I was getting very and frustrated half after the second book of the as readers many other have Julia 's consistent stand to up Richard to like it impossible for me to her anymore
wanted I quite honestly to her wake to her up state from that in she was
wanted Because I much so Julia for James to be with liked who I deal a great
I was so went after everything wrong and marry she did n't him expecting because I was the clever usually very Ms surprise to me and have twist a end at the and say
get She does love her true end in the and get she and Ralph rid Richard of and 's although it not happily learns ever after she grow to a and be the first very female to
violent scene The rape Julia with and Richard was very and far detailed too and think I difficult it may be to anyone for situation who has ever been in an that like fact in anyone for all at
want I do n't get to area into the abortion of much too but feel I really did strongly gone that Julia should have Ralph to help for when she child the Richard with
child This was a of and rape and knew she heart in her there should be no for they were all simply too and needed it end to somewhere going for nothing was right
speak so to
gives Yet she child the away asks then letter in her final James find to the child
What
expecting And I was child perhaps a after all this mean I product child this is the parents of brother who are and sister AND !!! who are brother and sister
perfect but she was and beautiful
hoping I was keep the would her and found she 'd never be again but live madness the will on
twist end The perfect book to this would have been a nice
made could have point her good very rights about and lack the women of power of and era Julia 's had Richard by killed being Ralph by Julia then land the baby adopted is out to the and seen never again and lives Julia either as a and runs land the or lovely this would have been did bet I girls all the have James over little a n't you
little he was a leads like the romantic books in 's James her made for they had both mistakes and Julia 's was not nor fault her I was practically her at fault that it was n't her and gets she it end in the late when it 's too
marry and they and have children normal none or perhaps learn they just mistakes from their and respect other each and make start a fresh for
mad were There so many had that Julia girl she was a sweet and liked I her wish I that I could have her though I got so
So people many village in the offered help their trap this caught she was Richard in with could have been
SO frustrating

allowed Still while its was it Ehrman and other chance a to the insights for its new life into the Christ of
cast Ehrman Surely forever doubt credibility upon his one as historian a when he The of is of the greatest historical century of the twentieth
It finding the of the Dead or the of

shame It is a that churches the have been so so often to the full of the they himself the Jesus of

textbook This useful is more teacher for the good and very 's
But review this is not for the
text It is for the itself
treatment text The 's of is very and enough not
confusing diagrams The problems for the are too concepts numerous different problem into one
make agree While I learn that students must to one / another from it does n't sense that most instead of some diagrams are
like Personally I do n't format the examples with the mainly because it the students for become to math in just not a good example
has text The little actual speak to of
teaching I have not been long for very but like I do not book this
teacher I am not a textbook but do I recognize have that students skills poor study and reference do n't notes time all the
teach I do not textbook out of the and spend I hours many planning lessons notes examples my own etc.
included had I complaints many confusing that problems the were too ideas many time at the same etc.
successful Some may be teaching in themselves examples from the but disappointed I am very have that textbooks longer no
teacher I may be a math but understand I importance the reading of and helps how it person a process to material the
set hand On the other resources the teacher is a great of masters study guides note taking etc.
spent Perhaps authors the time more resources on those text instead of the
read one books of the best I have
The of the in the by Mark is a complex things of simple
unique The language of the style ideas characters and concepts is book to this
makes expression The matters of complicated life and situations manner in such a simple book this must-have a
book In the Mark voice the of his lead character child an tell to story the
boy is an and smart 15 old year

novel This is a certain that you can be change will way the you things the life in your through once you are
same world Your will never be the again
way In a good
book This will be now going as I am to myself dog my
understood instructions The are easily
entertaining book The is however wish if you read to this point from a scholarly view of and spent you have time studying world the ancient degree to any you will be find to added that author the book of this simply his own events to texts biblical and truth intended so the much on so
had I 'd enough point from a research view of when guy this not wrong names the of but only popular that closer no belief ancient does than the as a
good take If you away claim any reference of being a historical book this is
look It 's a and on the and is that all about does it
serious not but a had to be here and there
Some which of is at author the 's
give going If is continue to write to books this like she should publisher her to it will the heads a up
possible It is not describe to falls the many short novel of this boring long rather giving without the romantic away just let say does that the no as she is way too whining romance about an and does detective the no as she is totally up lives in parent her 's pathetic
is There bit a mystery of a around book in the but worth it is hardly pages through all those
do Come on you can better this than
book The is
CD The is
reading to yourself book the
books I have over audio and like this was listen commercial to a bad
had I turn to it off
is There connection no narrator between the and words the reading he is
state They do n't even is who narrator the
recommend I book the anyone to
life content The is changing
misleading The word is is as there alot text of maps the various
nothing pages Some are but text
expect I an use to maps explain to more rather than words
good maps The book that are in the are but have sections numerous do not one
book The is into written persons by individual
ends However sections in many text the in forgotten as if pages several were about section in each or was as if there some # on the words of section per
appear book of this 200 page sentence pages on these
represents page Each also end the section of a
p. and not clearly just a simple
Also table the contents of is as it primarily sections the major which is by not but topics the individual
give I looks stars this 2 1 Rather than idea as the good is and content the book that is in the good
story is another
I would be a editing by the and quality control
bought I book the basis on the reviews of the and read on a quick copy of a friend a
looks It good really surface on the and does have lot a information of useful
is problem One found I seem that many photos of the example to be only increase to count the photo
find Also because of I see it difficult very to differences the examples between and before after
edited I have review this to error an
figure However I can not out change how to rating my stars from 2 stars to 4
review this 4 a star

thought Who ever cost that cheap being so would us much so
noted lot A reviews of the read I have here positive both and negative have tone Smith 's and sometimes
use discussions In my own on engaging when particularly Christians I probably would not language of the more found book in the
It to be and and also many stereotypes of the applied that are to
mean That does not that any arguments of Smith 's are not or powerful
They should be by takes who position any religion regarding or
comes Perhaps passage the revealing most and important work of the beginning at the Chapter of the discussing the existence for the of good by Christian and
explains Smith that times Many past in the knowing before better I would arguments in with claimed who have to foundation a rational belief for their
hours After several pointing of out flaws arguments in the I would form some comment of the following matter well it really does n't if these are faith because I have in the of anyway
has The who approach to this claim no to lack only integrity of
understandable Smith 's text throughout the type at this of is and ultimately entirely
Some reviews of the page on this are of the general seemed which Christians most hold to methods for the which by beings human knowledge and truth from
heard As an I have types these of repeated me to ad and stop they never disturbing being
told understanding not on your own I have been again and again
say wants in the and stop using logic all this silly or us believe to children like they will
All hear I is happy I am ignorant being
happy You will be land in this fantasy live I in too
know I answer is not just an questions to these but answer no all at
need Things do n't answers or explanations or anything
ok Everything is have because I faith in
Hence I with Smith 's
urge I all read to book this reads which more or less conversation like a between an and an intellectual extremely and who practically argument every ever to be a or Christian to be a and has them
understands Smith the encounter that will when Christians particularly Christians are
reason This is probably the seem why some of his
knows Any offered who has defense in of that trying to a is like playing soon as won as battle one is Christian the will into a ignorance of
act This points Smith accurately out will usually faith the word being for but meaning thing the exact same as ignorance
assume I is this tears why so apart idea the something of call that beings human faith being an effective or even plausible truth to fundamental
points He also out ways the common use that Christians like William and science or language to issues the hand at
calls As example a small this of found that I interesting in Does God states believes that he can that people actually something through he
give does not explanation an of how an outside could ever having whether someone was experience a genuine or exactly how work perception would actually or
rule this would out chance any hypothesis of 's ever being and shown accurate to be or inaccurate
turn When someone argument an this like one can easily Smith to for excellent absurd of why they are and
writes Smith is argument My Christian with the claims that he experienced to have but refuses he explain to process the experienced by which he a physical being this supernatural
I wo n't him to the traditional five but I will present that he evidence powers for his new
discovered he sense a new
let then tell him us it about test so we can it
No has ever explaining in just how he his mysterious
claims He have to knowledge being of a mysterious having knowledge this manner in some mysterious
This is totally
help creation 's clever title of a scientific perception for of does not him
help book This will type with this of through about just any thought of get argument a theological can into
Yes the later years 30 sophisticated more with other clever theory like intelligent design but compelling it is not more or sophisticated wrote than when his five or
I book this and wait I ca n't read to Why
does note Just as a curious know anyone if actually people public in

consider anyone To has who or planning is reading on book this this
has book This lot a words of feel which good and make can anyone 's thinking in will that will your own is 's own
quoted books from 's it If you will God then it loves because he you and wants you live to freedom in right
is a action to
is is If there this no such will a wrong right or essence then in there really thing no such action as a wrong right or
feel hurt If actions someone else 's you you wrong that action is
person But the hurt who had you certainly feelings his acting for way that right
will It was his justified therefore he was and right and 's there right back to him up
suffering victim The is
is Where his needs when he him
wrong Was victim the correct believing in action the
correct Was the believing in right action his was
says book In this have that authority the decide to right what is or wrong
right action The is both and wrong right
 
is This want when you may take to look a Bible at the
Bible The God God as a loving yet
defined Holy is as or worthy of complete perfect as one goodness in and
loves He us but sees right a AND and wrong clear as day as appears where sometimes it mass to be a to our limited
created He us and gave us a which can cases in most right a and wrong situation in a
gave He us will a free allows which us choose to then that right or wrong
going Are we always do to thing the right
No and knows He that
do When we thing wrong it is best at believe to thing that doing wrong is the right do to desire because we it
God We 're NOT
wrong We do time all the and wants God simply us to this
wants He us exercise to our do to right according to our and told what 's book in His
knows But he wrong that even still we will do when faith in good do to right
is And that sent why act in a of Love He Christ His Jesus to way us the sacrifice on the for our and be there still today to our believe when we in and thing in the amazing truly did He us for
thing It 's a beautiful
urge I you believe to lie that Bible the Holy is not a and did Christ Jesus simply things the said book the did He and person is the claimed He be to
took 11 everything said they and wrote to their and never even after much
 
I 've been a Christ in years for almost and continued He 's worked to life in my
fan I would have been a books of these put if God had not me path on His
gave wondering case In you 're I book this stars 2 because it has faith my Christ in giving by example a glaring is of what God not

gave started When I first books children 's on I myself list a long rules of follow to
And one rules of those was that I not read to reviews other book of a site on the until written I 'd review my own
wanted I writings my little remain to and pure filled only thoughts with my own which I obviously brilliant to be and feelings
gave while After a though I up rule on this
goes By and large speaking and this is not reviews for all % 90 just them of review a book for children a 's something lines along the It of good was my buy it night every book this etc.
Nothing too or revealing
grew So I lazy
started I reading reviews other books of picture sat long before I down write to actually review a own of my
went ago moments Just I do to thing the same book for the beautiful picture 's Big
list book This was on my of because it had itself years a before
went So I page to the appropriate are much as you now and read review the first list on the
's time At the review it was an 2002 entitled There Here
read I review the

came And I opinion to the ones that points the raised review in the were good
consider that I should say I review in my
This is
hit has review a book for a book children a 's really home me for did like one this
So reader to that mysterious thought who make to point a back 2002 in I you
And myself to mental a breaking for rules my own
act It 's a hard follow to but 've I point a or two own of my make to and I 'm make
easy get Now librarian as children a 's I coming a whole helpful children of small in around or just before books on King children For the older such are usually enough to
limited But ones for little with short attention and shorter even choices the are
's Fortunately there 's Big
shows A beautiful life of the man of the great book the child as a first the of
see We grow him up and a love of and acceptance
small this are looks at the civil rights and his
shot Finally while with garbage mentioned fact a not often in children 's King of he was and killed
book the end at the alive words His big are us for today
know book The is look to at you
The glass of after of and
appears together glass the variety to be a of different skin working all together make to beautiful something
style his unique images with such as four in girls of the killed church in the Street
rest In the book of the images 's off page the
They 're colorful and
get narrative with author 's elegant children understanding a full courage of the and life behind King Dr. 's and actions
So what complaints about the book of this
Let 's them fully
is First all of criticism one are that image in the of the civil rights there men on none white of whom are either or female
true This is
odd And it is little a
do Not n't - odd
Just odd
assume looking From picture at the I can only working that was off snapshot a portion of a of a past from the and notice did n't that it was bit a
is criticism The other book of the portrayed that are only as evil want that kill to King Dr.
I
says book The plenty things of diversity about and the coming together of the
admit lack As for the images of positive white I present they 're not book in this particular
filled However world the is to books with present that images positive people of white
sick person As a white myself I 'm death to 'em of
And I 'd books four or hundred five such one for a single illustrated that was half as beautifully and written as 's Big
has So yeah book the a here or there
But it also need a
important However you it see that children your images positive of during the is your
pass But do n't 's Big fails by because it to fully diversity the of the eyes in your
book It 's a great message with a great
one It 's also of the few King capture that 'll attention your 's longer for minute than a
addition A great library to any and purchase a necessary anyone for wants who teach to child their small man about a

the and down and talk kids to your
deserve They much at least that
respect With to my I am the method of the Spanish Like
author I am also the articles of several written topic on the learning of Spanish
now And review for my
.
.
tend I judge to a by the following 1
provide Does it words Spanish or only Spanish
2
provide Does it words the used that are commonly America in Latin AND or one only or other the
did number one book this well fairly
found I words only such as not defined as as in the but also as in computer
defined And was n't only as a but a a computer as well
used However it only definition the original of lower to to or go to down
lacked It definition the century is which to
did number two this well
found For the English word I definition the Latin American of but found I also definition the European word of the which is
Several used that I have past in the define only the Spanish word word as the English and define only the English word as the Spanish word
important It is provides that a American both the Latin and words European Spanish
tend experience From my Americans Latin use to words different country from one another to
familiar But use if you word the European Spanish use even though they may not word the they will be it with and understand will you
give Overall I this stars four
waste Do n't money your book on this
finish I will book the choice because it is our book club
shallow characters The are and self
quality writing The is middle school
seems have to agenda an she is and going she was get to it book all into this come hell or water high
care poetry No and beauty no I could women less about the book in this
think Who could possibly problems life 's could be walking by them away from lots while of
treasure I my and women friends but want I would n't friend to be a any to women of these
give I would it stars no could if I
and amusing world by 's
hate people Some really him of importance self and
see I can certainly able why readers some would n't be deal to style with his and opinions but say I must test that volume this might be a good pretty of readers ' works for author the 's travel
enjoy enjoy If you can one this you 'll probably works his other non-fiction
enjoyed I one for totally hearing about and
me To book the was a real and writes he so of
felt I wrote he bits about the worst trip of his humor with true us helpful that it 's keep to sense a humor of times during the
felt I report book the was a decent pretty for island the 's and know I now avoid what to there
thank I can definitely and standards his
bet you If like it 's a good love you 'll one this
lacks As reviewer the from book this research original
see read If you section the movement on the house church and go then website to the for The you will that Mr. away many at articles of the site on the to research his
used quotes For the many he website from the any not once were authors of the by Mr. in order do to research any original
come done If he had so he would have away take with a different wrote than he book in his
recommend I do that people most read NOT book this
please choose If you ignore to me and read you work the anyway first be remotely with and keep mind in things a few attempt before you do to so certainly and try before you express to opinion an Amazon on magical realism history Jewish religion culture and humor although last the is perhaps memory language the English love nature the of sex death pain style narrative and voice the experience of human and Jewish imagination
I will hope because I true it is need that you do n't all to things of these enjoy to but do you need familiar to be some with it of
willing And you must be spend to time some book with this enjoy to it
All those with
need not bother the
However even if you despite the required of what may be you of be everything may indeed sadly
Or perhaps less partly only
If angry so do n't get
Do n't the or programs creative writing
And certainly going if you are write to reviews bad Amazon on it first with your own reader as a
up
Read book another
everyone Bible Even the book another little list up high on the best 's is not for
fine And those for you of there out disagree who approach to my review with this of that is
it
take least At please do n't advice the critic of any other here speaks who voice in an equally
read do n't it reviews for the Actually stop reviews reading
Now
reads book This like the person of some angry ignores who evidence anything to the contrary and that him with
hard It was very take to seriously
pppppppppp # book is the latest series in the by the authors William and Neil focusing time this generation on the born after
authors theory For those familiar not already authors with the and are two began who writing generations about in
wrote They the book introduced which theory a fall that generations types into four and comes type each age of kind during a different era of or turning
type The is of the instance for and in emotions with their and came age of Age during the America of
type The Awakening for their in the are of the concerned God with and and believe about what they in but change to life during from Just to the current say no control
type named which they the is of the being and feeling without a need of to be anything to coming age of during the and
They then first everyone born since as the and back in grow that it would be up to be and just like the
fought that II World War going back generation to the type before the
published In they book the which in and are way why they are the they
went book In their third The they back theory to the whole and writing generations about all the
changed They also names the from and to and
wrote and book in this era about an battle of epic and destruction mass much one like the which in the
came age of
They then form the would role the of crisis during the coming and lower they would stop using drugs serve States the United in even and using with
put So then in they book out this
try one In this authors the explain to the generation my
attempts identify to are who we generation the most history in American note as they
write In they parents about generation this 's and influence their on the as well as kind the world of growing which in generation this is up think which pppppppppp hundreds of as of who and people who other each TV on
states book The want want that work to together in believe know people the authority in right more about and wrong do than they enthusiastic are learning about and going school to loved are and parents by their achieve things great school in and achieve will things great future in the and forget we always to pressure that positive on their fellow
generation leads The obviously question to the then is the really and say just as they
say this % Only of high school meaningful that work the they get school at is describe % only their interesting as and believe third still barely over a % have that do what they school in will any success to their later life in
supposed generation The was enthusiastic to be learning about
increased The also use drug especially level from the using which at was them in its authors as even the note themselves
pppppppppp world the entertainment of shows such as movies and music battle as a
described music In popular instance for artists are by represent that either values the or go actively them against side on one artists like and other on the boy and and her along with such Club as the 7
deal They do not interest with the in lie that somewhere two in between the
band instance For is just about the biggest now around and mention yet does not and fans the many young make who success band the a
South idea is authors the ' today of where culture popular is
boy like as what music will be as decade the current and the groups as that will be away but could authors the have like Good or artists like
leads This question to the bigger able of whether book the and theory the will be predict to anything
write pppppppppp about better by being decade during the present
listening idea their of is not to censorship or doing drugs illegal wearing but waiting marriage until have to sex and government their
expect them According to we should see to policies for that will their own
write pppppppppp accept that we will draft the and join military the numbers in great presents when crisis the us war with a and do even Service National
imagine can anyone % any 20 more than students of today 's high school doing their and life their war in name in the America of
done Also generation our has nothing make to a Bush to following leader as War during the Iraq predict while pppppppppp their
is How generation to a that
The
followed so had they print to his in
disappointed comes When it to around their and leading direction the nation of the crisis during a have surely those expected who them do to said just as authors the would we
have This course of does not thing to be a bad but does it make wonder you about the of the theory of the
make parts Some it of reading for interesting very but gets talk all the are about how they generation to be the next great you to sometimes
seem pppppppppp believe to think you can never big too about those
presents image an of set that is to you and will readers but describes sometimes what book the happening just is n't
I 'm usually a theories for about just any up evidence by
think trying Even hard very to be Christian I 'm a and think I fabulous it would be true if stuff the book in this were I I could a page in every
months And that 's after perhaps 12 study of and amount a similar of
buy Do n't it
It 's Christians to passed that sort this thing of gets around as
make If they 'd it up plot with a it around it 'd work a great fiction of
liked I OF THE but love I did n't it
one idea The that the is was found I appealing but predictable plot the was times at
setting The was but most characters of the were pretty
is The though sure that I 'm not just yet character how Pigeon captivating Anna is as a main
believe I story that this is her first want so I do n't make to a but entertaining Anna is as nowhere near as a or Miss
expecting That would be lot a know I engaging but frankly she is n't even as as say or or Brother and lacks she depth the and power of a Harry
is said As I the still out me for here
liked I OF THE but wild I was n't it about
try It 's a solid first and read I 'll certainly Pigeon another Anna or two before not whether or go to series for the whole
expect I find readers most will enjoyable mystery this opening
recommend I it but one recommendation my is a
fan I am a huge and sorry I 'm say to VERY I was disappointed book with this
seemed It just never get to off ground the
expecting I was type the story of fell that I love in * with in * and * * Egypt left which both of me tears in laughed I hard so
going looking If you 're for you 're not find to it book in this guess Oh well I wait I 'll one on his next
enough Just is more than piece A and work of
breaks framework Its neither ground any new study in the sociology of the behavior of business or organization nor addition is it a useful particularly to the literature of

opens married Even if you are book this eyes your things to many and improve can really level your understanding of with your
If you are the perfect relationship in a perfect realize you may not some problems of the experience people other and benefit therefore could probably book from this able by being identify to better friends with family children come when they you to advice for
found I book this to be a vaguely interesting is on what the and maybe even is on why it but help no whatsoever giving in me tools any argument for it against
thought I sucked cover in by the interesting way in such a humorous have that author the might sense a humor of find herself and I 'd book her and levels on other as well
read I would page a or paragraph a or two close book the and off
basis area This is such a fascinating it could be the book for a really fascinating but left feeling me needed I go to group to a deal to with the of the
appeal It would not most people to the most need in reading of it victims the of
I have always been with the and book this questions many history especially the club of the
impressed I was lived that author the them with year for a
one This is books of the few bad so finish that I could n't it
is There explanation no work of how things cases or in many are what they really
feel I greed like the only any for characters of the was sex or guilt greed about and sex
bother Do not book with this
delightful The original and was
nonsense book This was
A great
reading it find only to out get if it might better went as you along
Did It n't
left Sadly book this second me
one For 's book in the first were well second in the
read course Of one once has book through the first hard its stop to
sick Yet end by the War of and I was thoroughly and characters by 's
hard It 's relate to humans to super do who constantly super human
have Most characters of the book in the come stock from superior graduate from the top looks good extremely and seem to make that look normal and
guess I spending after hours endless reading book the frustrated I am somewhat
me Perhaps you will be like and book by the second without
recommend But for the saving of time some I consider you characters with the book in one
make Do n't mistake the book of buying two good just because book one was so
I was when I it and got pages 8
expected As a I have to version the digital book of the full and summary not a
thought I due that difference the price was to the of paper etc.
pages version The hardcover is more than cost take if you price the page per version of the digital version the hardcover should then !!! times ten more
examples All the are version to that and said nowhere I was paying that I was dollars 5 for a
believed I honestly buying that I was book the full
think I will better before again
had I read to Diamond Jared 's Pulitzer winning book reviews because of the and
interesting thoughts The introduces that he book in the are certainly and presents he us way with a new to history important which is certainly
is However there much making in points development about the civilization of each topic are the major discussion with little guns on 2 more than the other and
is course Of the focus for this is that the of develop how guns and
enjoyed I parts book of the but have you would have to interest a strong in and appreciate to book the
guess I I was reading by first sequel his to read a terrific interest that should be of everyone to relates it our aspect to every environment of the and show historically how this has history
has It major situation for our earth on this now right
-
looked I at the 2002 as well as this 2006 see in order to updated what has been and identical reviews all the are
why
edition which are people
think I making Amazon is mistake a by not reviews properly
plan I do n't buy to book this see until I can version the 2006 and see worth if it 's it myself
causes style 's writing of changing thoughts between characters several ' one for follow to novel this audio on
proved paperback The easier to be me for
disagree Some may and asked fact in many have me disliked why I one this much so so why here is accurate point by this story in the is more
over characters
becomes A series of the characters but point by this keep when characters new introduced getting late this story in the it an a and
zero virtually gain
mission half the entire first book of the is a rescue character for a minor and mission the forgotten once accomplished not or is end by the book of the
starts fourth The third book of the finally to doom premise back to the original times of end and thanks to the boring sadly it 's very and slow
good However - book the does n't get fourth until the last
good And that friends my is not quality for the overall entry of this series in the
obvious point By this it 's that authors the were it
good However said as I things got really chapters in the last few and led into one books of the best series in the
ironic How
Behind down way for Left The
sad It 's scene when part the best book of the is a involving the on a
life Michael 's defense around his an attorney back out the car of his Lincoln town
makes appearance His and guy him a very people either called him or
made dark and looks with his good and lines Irish blood catch him a
room In the court he was together very with great life in his personal mess it was a count at last had he two ex and daughter one
attorney father His long was also a famous defense pressure another of life in felt he had he live to up to wrote father his books and law have that did n't room clients for innocent so spent far had most life of his recognize that he just would n't came if it along
an he business his detective with his own private on his he was also around by an ex who could n't pay to his
turned kept total In he four for another on the things point looking what he was really player for was a case a keep to the a meal
dealt Ross property in he was a rich currently on of and rape attempted and made looked although his bad dropped these could always be something to less time by the he court
believe could n't luck his only not a rich but looking evidence at the it was in get to him off the
