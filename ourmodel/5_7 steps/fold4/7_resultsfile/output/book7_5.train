Where author the outside sense of common he 's so sometimes <sssss> part book This is tradition of the sociology in thinking of pulls that society the eyes over each individuals that reality is a social purpose with no control other than social performance here the is the and has control the do to with but this quickly mess into an obscure of <sssss> is There support no real most given for

no <sssss> cited sources sociology of are but more this is like intellectual <sssss> is that author some didnt which also have support any claims for his you with just to reader your into claims your <sssss> have claims The book in the application no practical world in the but serve only situations to and opinion in personal less correctly <sssss> said Nothing lead here will predictions to better behavior about social or understanding a better psychology of <sssss> isnt short In this study a scientific all at <sssss> deserves My final book with the paragraph its own use the language of <sssss>

definition This is a <sssss> changes Me performance while work i is a it the of and atmosphere in the near my <sssss> see performance Me space into is a people other me space into and influenced are therefore <sssss> performance me simply is a causes since my effect a on the other as well as them create to beliefs me about <sssss> fall Its created as if definition a performance for included which

<sssss> goes are While there various truth of book throughout the some it of off into the takes where he thought a and it consider to I would be what to conclusion to be an <sssss> uses In some he biblical support to claims his takes however looking in further he some passages of the Bible from the context out of <sssss> should presented Some ideas of his are ideas as if they were new but think I would most us of age by a young already understanding an principles of these <sssss> hold Although book his has been highly I position the lacks that Ruiz Mr. credibility and logic writer as a therefore losing standing good me with reader as a <sssss> given Ruiz According to children as we are not opportunity the choose to beliefs our own <sssss> go When we rules against the we are rewarded

lose rational By his we ability the choose to our own <sssss> become Instead we victims it of <sssss> word One things of the few agree we agreement upon is his first be word with your however he bible the John says when he beginning In the was the and God word the was with and God word the was <sssss> uses He it to use the word of speaks as in what one 26 <sssss> says passage down further little a in that it also made word The was flesh and us among <sssss> talking passage This is not form about a speech of or speaking rather but Christ Jesus <sssss> became Christ flesh and us among <sssss> says chapter In that same he begins that sin rejection with yourself of <sssss> says However Christianity in it that sin is a law of the 1 John and that sin is do to will God 's James <sssss> self It 's not about but about God 's <sssss> concept agree While I something that watching say what we is need we all to for this is not a new <sssss> learned children Most have age by the 6 of say that have if you do n't nice something say to do n't it all at <sssss> take agreement In his second do n't anything personally says he do that people nothing you is because of <sssss> leads true While this is degree to some he reader the path down a of says when he personal that took even if someone a and shot you head in the it was nothing <sssss> nothing So essence in shot when Mary was by Amy expression

This logic of victims remain to relationships in dysfunctional and continue to victims <sssss> glad American As an I 'm took that someone 9/11 personally <sssss> takes Ruiz According to Mr. he criticism neither nor <sssss> seems It place to myself far so above turn that I would a forms to all criticism of <sssss> believe gave When professor my College writing me opinion his work regarding my following if I were line the authors reasoning of I would trying that professor my was to mind my and was me garbage his emotional suggests as Ruiz Mr. <sssss> believe I would rather has that my

line this author by Robert Kagan Paradise of Of And Power has not only attention the many of but managed to up wave a discussions of politicians among the and concerned relations with <sssss> introduced thought Kagan 's provoking became book popular extremely and received international analysis for its relationship of the not to mention its and phrases throughout the captivating yet book <sssss> introduces Kagan chapters multiple book in his in order to issues the key underlying claims which he causes are divide of the ever US between and Europe <sssss> starts chapter In the The Power Kagan War from World understand I to the Europe military towards and <sssss> argues He that while both the World Europe helped they US the power as a super <sssss> He further might on the US of the chapter in the follows that Power of and <sssss> explains Kagan affect how lack power of can not only and ideologies but perspectives change as well <sssss> claims He Europe 's power of military it to only not ignore threats but them and together all try at the same time and force the US by world a which is methods by economic and soft <sssss> chapter This into chapter a discusses which in Kagan details Kosovo of and failure Europe 's and America 's in situation the <sssss> presents He finally argument his central chapters in the Paradise The Modern and The World America states where Kagan

the growing self-centered Europe of and questions It validity the terms of west such as chapter in his Is Still West The <sssss> seems Finally it provides Kagan solution a problem to this US of the divide Europe chapter in his concluding to stating by simply line one is task the Europeans for both and Americans to reality to the new of American <sssss> needs book This small extremely addresses as issue compared to the it analysis further and some close <sssss> are There issues many addressed to be analysis in Kagan 's brief and one might not be completely claims with certain or manner the which in topic such a and sensitive is <sssss> manages is While there tone a bias of underlying contrast in opinion to the general view of a holds that author the Kagan miss to out facts some crucial and figures mention not to present and lacks essay the <sssss> point start To with let me out the arguments in Kagan 's presence the which of highly claims his leaving reader the in a argument of either <sssss> claims Kagan produced Europe 's relative has interest a European powerful building in world a matter where strength military and power hard less power than economic and soft rules behavior of pg <sssss> goes He on say to natural lack Since Europeans the to actions military either or Europe as it is that they should others do to do that they can not themselves <sssss> has pg contrast in to Europe today wealth the and make to wanted itself more power of a world terms in military if Europe become to kind that power of world <sssss> contradicts Kagan puts views his own stating times many weak that Europe is nor does have it the build to up forces its yet time at the same forth argument an capabilities of Europe 's increasing of spending its defense and might military match to US the <sssss> contradicts chapter In the Power of and claim Kagan 's one another made which is chapter in the next seem as reasoning the claims for both his to be absolutely <sssss> explains He first due Europe 's greater threats for is to its and past the which from it has <sssss> explains He then it giving by example the man of a with a and one the same with a having different threat of the word when bear a pg <sssss> Kagan But again feels himself become Europe can power a military wishes as and when it to says when he spend They could easily much twice as spending as they are currently defense on believed if they necessary it do to so pg <sssss> forces So this me ask to question a would one be bear by a produce if one could a prevent to this <sssss> possible So is n't it quite feel that Europeans safe they not because enjoy ride the free gotten they have under the American security decades over the past six pg but was rather because there and threat is no real all at <sssss> seems use With the phrases of such as The of and States pg uses which Kagan describe to Iraq and Iran mention not to references his to of uses which he as a war to the Iraq in seem which still to be reason for some he to me ignoring by creation his own <sssss> want maintains While Kagan threat that Iraq was a and US the it one as did while Europe not he might explain to as to why in he Director Kagan was the of the Century for the New American document a which American of the threats of Iraq from or Iran <sssss> sought States The United has decades for play to role a more security in Gulf <sssss> provides While conflict the Iraq with the immediate need the presence for a American force Gulf in the issue the of the of perspective From an American value the of such would

region in the would still be an essential strategy in U.S. security given interests the American region in the <sssss> forces pg America 's 1 * This me conclude to either that author the has picking to evidence of or he from <sssss> seem Some reasoning of his analysis and to be too <sssss> justify explaining When action military one can not it saying by start have When you a problems all look to like <sssss> speaks author The nation about the 's US 's go to war to has simply because it ability the and the do to so <sssss> seems discussing Without need a or providing reasons concrete use for the aggression of author the content to be in use force of has simply because one it <sssss> aspects aspect One important leaves Kagan out analysis in his are the political and of the <sssss> note discussed While I have review later aspects some in the one must mention that Kagan does not the apart from Clinton 's it of pg <sssss> created The US from the had problems serious and between the two * 2 <sssss> seem were While there issues many other that further fire the growing over the example for which conveniently Kagan under the needed addressed to be discussing if one is relations * 3 4 book For a covers which issues decade from the II World War going occasionally back philosophy to ancient issues to the present citations explanations which from many are simply examples for 19 see notes 20 low to be especially with the ones of some important and mention not to citations certain which facts to historical <sssss> mentions Kagan some As put Europeans it division the real labor of States of the United making dinner the and doing Europeans the dishes the pg yet refer he does not source to any statement for this <sssss> says He believed majority The vast Europeans of always that threat the if any by was more risk than the of him statements along with other is like The and Iraq of 's sought what precisely they Europe pg and gives again source no for the beliefs of these <sssss> supports he one claims of his stating by note in his pg found matter for that this is also commonly view the textbooks in American <sssss> expect One might not generally see to evidence such analysis in a scholarly relations of <sssss> Kagan times at back times to and has strong essay in his <sssss> mentions He number a times of see how Americans world the perspective from a followers while Europeans are policies of <sssss> seems Kagan overlooked to have fact the that described though had state the nature of that as all of all against the only reason is a to peace earth on <sssss> conveniently Kagan theory flawed itself was as philosophers later it as justify to aggression American no but aggression where theory in ' is justified by the <sssss> are There conclusions some draws Kagan seem which beliefs to be of an American living world in a pure where politics is as religion as <sssss> concludes He providing that while US the was security free Europe to War after the Cold power America 's great and assume to responsibility for other given pg has Europe opportunity the build to up <sssss> Kagan further point his says when he spend Given America 's spend to money much so them Europeans would rather money their own programs on social welfare long and shorter pg <sssss> These are inaccurate facts of which are more of ideologies bias <sssss> like I would put to forth points two in order to the statements of these two <sssss> was First interest America 's Europe in not provide to it security with before whether or War after the Cold <sssss> One must not fact the purely that measures taken to the Soviet was motives for selfish rather than benefit for the of eye which were under the of the Kagan himself fact the says when he free removed With check the power of the Soviet States the United was to practically chose whenever and it <sssss> results Second when Kagan position that Europe has which economy a $ 9 is in a comfortable support to programs its welfare spending along with increased military fact the spends that Europe more welfare on calls as he them analysis in a <sssss> seem mentioned When I had earlier chose that Kagan to and ignore facts certain example the of the cited which author the has times many book in his would relevant most <sssss> one Kosovo is issues of the primary discusses he bring to forth US and European <sssss> based involvement American Kosovo in or was not on interest of a narrow American national is had While Americans interest a compelling moral genocide in and ethnic had US the interest no national at in the pg this sees how Kagan it <sssss> concern Indeed genocide was a but concern was it the only <sssss> seem While had much very troops to station Kosovo in stop to the none interested to have been offer in his wanted they rather access complete and control all to of <sssss> reason The added which to the note B an day on the last of the held Paris at one must was the primary for troops as it to its and <sssss> mention Yet he does not of troops to station Kosovo in 5 * <sssss> are thing Some missing book from Kagan 's entire America words the Latin and Africa <sssss> believes seen As above Kagan spending America was money its Europe and Europe alone threats from all the world around the War before and after the Cold War before and after the Cold <sssss> is But what me to quite an does that once not mention Kagan about any American America in Latin official or not Africa or East the matter for that <sssss> aware Those aware who are well world of the them around will be support of America 's for and other America throughout Latin and the East far example for self which were for serving purposes alone or it is that author the is threat that American the Latin and countries African were a Europe to the and mention no them of <sssss> found timeline A complete by can be sites on multiple * 6 7 8 is There one severe put as I it which argument the entire book of this <sssss> results approach Kagan 's vision refers which power to the word terms only in strength of military and capabilities ultimately in a false which is the thesis for his <sssss> believes Kagan world the and left Europe in particular is options with two follow that they either US the or audience be a <sssss> due reason The reaches he conclusion this put as I previously it is view to his <sssss> says Rather than US the as a down by Kagan realize leaders American should that they are hardly all at capable that Europe is not really of US the <sssss> He claim this book throughout his see - pg 33 etc <sssss> ignorance author The 's facts about valid highly and relevant has severe validity to the claims of his <sssss> committed Kagan has errors serious here ignoring by strength Europe 's military not but political and indeed <sssss> overlooked population With a of * Book the CIA 9 and still growing the leave aside Europe can not be simply or aside as a dead or culture a <sssss> proved enough Europe is strong trouble to to wants US the as and when it problems the recent meat over the steel industry and more many have all much that strength Europe 's economic is concern of a US for the <sssss> believe point While I must out a I factor this is ' the single capable which is for all against thesis of Kagan 's and arguments and that is the American <sssss> mentioned Not once has he state the American of economy did even though problems exist wrote when he book this <sssss> seems He ignorant to be and that America can spending its defense US the can levels its current military spending and far its current global future into the <sssss> were rate the growing rising trends showing economy the was of towards a believe I myths as author by the see for statistics * 10 11 <sssss> suggest Also solution Kagan 's final is that answer The obvious should that Europe and build up military its even if only leaves me with a <sssss> Is Kagan has that Europe military no all at or it is wants that he begin to race a new time this II Cold War <sssss> writing understand Kagan must he is book this for international and simply not those ideologies whose are in his with <sssss> is doubt I disagree most would get that world the should race into an here know as we all there no evil to this starts if it once <sssss> is discussed While I have already effects the trade of and economics which Kagan on the there something point I must out end before I review this <sssss> Kagan conveniently rather topic of the relationships which is to US fashion in a <sssss> writes agree While Americans most themselves would probably not ideology with Kagan 's see as opinion the public and faith sources from various news 12 * leave aside Europeans or rest world of the Kagan pages 15 almost justify to it <sssss> conclusion This was a disappointing rather book to his thinks where he solution the only divide to the ever is to <sssss> audience believe says When Kagan many how seem statistics to him Americans that by interest their they interest the humanity of sounds he and quotes drive to home the point he saying as cause cause America 's is the mankind of all and bring again I must notice to author the 's the of these is an international which is has culture its own and beliefs religious and ideologies and has reason no believe to why culture their or beliefs are other to any <sssss> realize author An of his must relationships that it is and not a primary discussed that is being <sssss> seems While he take to saying in has that America attitude a go alone it pg it does not by the UN pg takes action laws of international pg justified is adopting in standards double pg fails he to the situation of the current day day or rather the wrote when he book this and the growing policy of American foreign world around the <sssss> justified sees While he Europe as an path in the goals of America 's a neutral would be more than pointing in out be that may US it is the that progress and efforts of the to world a which laws international rights human opinion collective public and most all of peace <sssss> fails He give to an solution if not a complete to go world the of this concludes as he essay his saying by understanding a little common can still way a long <sssss> have While many nothing words but praise of calls as summary a one line by it a and of America the 's and according to Dr. Henry -LSB- been against whom of human right have terms who Kagan as a <sssss> See cases for 13 * list for crimes of -RSB- * 14 book the is a seminal shape which would discussion the years for
