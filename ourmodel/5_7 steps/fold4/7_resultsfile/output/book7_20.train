Wadood Murshedkar		Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order: Books: Robert Kagan		1		 <sssss> are from and are from from simply a few line this author by Kagan of Of And has not only attention the many of but to up a of among the and with <sssss> thought Kagan 's book extremely and analysis for its relationship of the not to mention its and throughout the yet book <sssss> Kagan chapters book in his in order to issues the key claims which he are of the ever US between and Europe <sssss> starts chapter In the The Kagan War from World understand I to the Europe military and <sssss> He that while both the World Europe helped they US the power as a <sssss> He further might on the US of the chapter in the that of and <sssss> explains Kagan how lack power of can not only and but change as well <sssss> claims He Europe 's power of military it to only not but them and together all try at the same time and force the US by world a which is by economic and <sssss> chapter This into chapter a which in Kagan details of and Europe 's and America 's in situation the <sssss> He finally argument his chapters in the The and The World America states where Kagan Europe 's state into its present under the of the U.S. and could not have it without <sssss> on Europe 's Kagan argument his on the Europe of and questions It the terms of such as chapter in his Is The <sssss> seems it provides Kagan a problem to this US of the Europe chapter in his to by simply line one is the for both and to reality to the new of American <sssss> needs book This small extremely as issue to the it analysis further and some close <sssss> are There issues many to be analysis in Kagan 's and one might not be completely claims with certain or the which in topic such a and is <sssss> is While there a of in opinion to the general view of a that author the Kagan to out facts some and mention not to present and the <sssss> point start To with let me out the in Kagan 's the which of highly claims his reader the in a argument of either <sssss> claims Kagan Europe 's has interest a powerful in world a matter where military and power hard less power than economic and behavior of <sssss> goes He on say to natural lack the to actions military either or Europe as it is that they should others do to do that they can not themselves <sssss> has in to Europe today the and make to wanted itself more power of a world terms in military if Europe become to kind that power of world <sssss> Kagan views his own times many that Europe is nor does have it the to up its yet time at the same argument an of Europe 's of its and might military to US the <sssss> chapter In the of and claim Kagan 's one another made which is chapter in the next seem as the claims for both his to be absolutely <sssss> explains He first due Europe 's for is to its and past the which from it has <sssss> explains He then it giving by example the man of a with a and one the same with a having different of the word when a <sssss> Kagan But again himself become Europe can power a military as and when it to says when he spend They could easily much as as they are on if they necessary it do to so <sssss> So this me ask to question a would one be by a if one could a to this <sssss> possible So is n't it quite feel that they not because enjoy the free they have under the American over the past but was rather because there and is no real all at <sssss> seems use With the of such as The of and uses which Kagan describe to Iraq and mention not to his to of uses which he as a war to the Iraq in seem which still to be reason for some he to me by his own <sssss> want While Kagan that Iraq was a and US the it one as did while Europe not he might explain to as to why in he Kagan was the of the for the New American a which American of the of Iraq from or <sssss> The has for play to role a more in <sssss> provides While the Iraq with the need the for a American force in the issue the of the of perspective From an American value the of such would pass even should from the <sssss> term the long may well as large a to U.S. in the has as Iraq <sssss> And even should in the would still be an in U.S. given the American in the <sssss> America 's 1 * This me to either that author the has to evidence of or he from <sssss> seem Some of his analysis and to be too <sssss> When action military one can not it saying by start have When you a problems all look to like <sssss> author The about the 's US 's go to war to has simply because it the and the do to so <sssss> seems need a or use for the of author the content to be in use force of has simply because one it <sssss> aspects One important Kagan out analysis in his are the political and of the <sssss> While I have review later aspects some in the one must mention that Kagan does not the from 's it of <sssss> The US from the had problems serious and between the two * 2 <sssss> seem were While there issues many other that further the over the example for which Kagan under the needed to be if one is * 3 4 book For a covers which issues from the World War going back philosophy to issues to the present which from many are simply examples for see 20 to be especially with the ones of some important and mention not to certain which facts to historical <sssss> Kagan some As put it the real of of the making the and doing the the yet he does not source to any for this <sssss> says He The of always that the if any by was more than the of him along with other is like The and Iraq of 's what they Europe and gives again source no for the beliefs of these <sssss> he one claims of his by in his found matter for that this is also view the in American <sssss> expect One might not see to evidence such analysis in a of <sssss> Kagan times at back times to and has strong in his <sssss> He number a times of see how world the perspective from a while are of <sssss> seems Kagan to have fact the that though had state the nature of that as all of all against the only reason is a to on <sssss> Kagan theory itself was as later it as to American no but where theory in ' is by the <sssss> are There some Kagan seem which beliefs to be of an American living world in a where is as religion as <sssss> He that while US the was free Europe to War after the power America 's great and to for other given has Europe the to up <sssss> Kagan further point his says when he spend America 's spend to money much so them would rather money their own on social long and <sssss> These are facts of which are more of <sssss> like I would put to points two in order to the of these two <sssss> was interest America 's Europe in not provide to it with before whether or War after the <sssss> One must not fact the that taken to the was for rather than benefit for the of which were under the of the Kagan himself fact the says when he free With the power of the the was to and it <sssss> results when Kagan that Europe has which a $ is in a support to its along with military fact the that Europe more on as he them analysis in a <sssss> seem When I had earlier that Kagan to and facts certain example the of the which author the has times many book in his would most <sssss> one is issues of the he to US and <sssss> based American in or was not on interest of a American is had While interest a in and had US the interest no at in the this how Kagan it <sssss> was a but was it the only <sssss> seem While had much very to in stop to the interested to have been offer in his wanted they rather complete and all to of <sssss> reason The which to the an day on the last of the at one must was the for as it to its and <sssss> mention he does not of to in 5 * <sssss> are thing Some missing book from Kagan 's entire America words the and <sssss> seen As Kagan America was money its Europe and Europe alone from all the world around the War before and after the War before and after the <sssss> is But what me to quite an does that once not mention Kagan about any American America in or not or East the matter for that <sssss> who are well world of the them around will be support of America 's for and other America throughout and the East far example for self which were for alone or it is that author the is that American the and were a Europe to the and mention no them of <sssss> found A complete by can be on * 6 is There one put as I it which argument the entire book of this <sssss> results approach Kagan 's which power to the word terms only in of military and in a which is the for his <sssss> Kagan world the and left Europe in particular is with two follow that they either US the or be a <sssss> due reason The he this put as I it is view to his <sssss> says than US the as a down by Kagan realize American should that they are hardly all at that Europe is not really of US the <sssss> He claim this book throughout his see <sssss> author The 's facts about highly and has to the claims of his <sssss> Kagan has errors serious here by Europe 's military not but political and indeed <sssss> With a of * Book the and still the leave Europe can not be simply or as a dead or culture a <sssss> enough Europe is strong to to wants US the as and when it problems the over the and more many have all much that Europe 's economic is of a US for the <sssss> believe point While I must out a I this is ' the single which is for all against of Kagan 's and and that is the American <sssss> Not once has he state the American of did even though problems wrote when he book this <sssss> seems He to be and that America can its US the can its current military and far its current future into the <sssss> were the the was of a believe I as author by the see for * 10 <sssss> Also Kagan 's final is that The obvious should that Europe and up military its even if only me with a <sssss> Is Kagan has that Europe military no all at or it is wants that he to a new time this War <sssss> writing understand Kagan must he is book this for and simply not those whose are in his with <sssss> is doubt I most would get that world the should into an here know as we all there no evil to this starts if it once <sssss> is While I have already the of and which Kagan on the there something point I must out end before I review this <sssss> Kagan rather topic of the which is to US in a <sssss> writes agree While most themselves would probably not with Kagan 's see as opinion the public and faith from various * leave or rest world of the Kagan pages almost to it <sssss> This was a disappointing rather book to his where he the only to the ever is to <sssss> believe says When Kagan many how seem to him that by interest their they interest the of he and to home the point he saying as cause cause America 's is the of all and again I must to author the 's the of these is an which is has culture its own and beliefs and and has reason no believe to why culture their or beliefs are other to any <sssss> realize author An of his must that it is and not a that is being <sssss> seems While he take to saying in has that America a go alone it it does not by the takes action of is in fails he to the situation of the current day day or rather the wrote when he book this and the of American world around the <sssss> While he Europe as an in the of America 's a would be more than in out be that may US it is the that and of the to world a which human opinion public and most all of <sssss> fails He give to an if not a complete to go world the of this as he his saying by understanding a little common can still way a long <sssss> have While many nothing words but of as a one line by it a and of America the 's and to Dr. -LSB- been against of human right have terms who Kagan as a <sssss> cases for * list for of -RSB- * book the is a which would the years for come to I do not particularly it it <sssss> put As I have already data show to why book the evidence a argument or makes though its easy and its read it a good it problem
