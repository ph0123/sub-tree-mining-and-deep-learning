Iraq and Iran mention not to his to of uses which he as a war to the Iraq in seem which still to be reason for some he to me by his own <sssss> want While that Iraq was a and US the it one as did while Europe not he might explain to as to why in he was the of the for the New American a which American of the of Iraq from or Iran <sssss> The has for play to role a more security in <sssss>

one it <sssss> aspects One important out analysis in his are the political and of the <sssss> While I have review later aspects some in the one must mention that does not the from 's it of <sssss> created The US from the had problems serious and between the two * 2 <sssss> seem were While there issues many other that further the growing over the example for which under the needed to be if one is * 3 4 book For a covers which issues from the World War going back philosophy to issues to the present which from many are simply examples for see notes 20 to be especially with the ones of some important and mention not to certain which facts to historical <sssss> mentions some As put it the real of of the making the and doing the the yet he does not source to any statement for this <sssss> says He The of always that the if any by was more risk than the of him along with other is like The and Iraq of 's what they Europe and gives again source no for the beliefs of these <sssss> he one claims of his by in his found matter for that this is also view the in American <sssss> expect One might not generally see to evidence such analysis in a of <sssss> times at back times to and has strong in his <sssss> mentions He number a times of see how world the perspective from a while are of <sssss> seems to have fact the that though had state the nature of that as all of all against the only reason is a to earth on <sssss> theory itself was as later it as to American no but where theory in ' is by the <sssss> are There some seem which beliefs to be of an American living world in a where politics is as religion as <sssss> He that while US the was security free Europe to War after the power America 's great and to for other given has Europe the to up <sssss> further point his says when he spend America 's spend to money much so them would rather money their own on social long and <sssss> These are facts of which are more of <sssss> like I would put to points two in order to the of these two <sssss> was First interest America 's Europe in not provide to it security with before whether or War after the <sssss> One must not fact the that taken to the was for rather than benefit for the of which were under the of the himself fact the says when he free With check the power of the the was to and it <sssss> results when position that Europe has which economy a $ is in a support to its along with military fact the spends that Europe more on as he them analysis in a <sssss> seem mentioned When I had earlier that to and facts certain example the of the which author the has times many book in his would most <sssss> one is issues of the he to US and <sssss> based American in or was not on interest of a American is had While interest a compelling in and had US the interest no at in the this how it <sssss> was a but was it the only <sssss> seem While had much very to in stop to the none interested to have been offer in his wanted they rather complete and control all to of <sssss> reason The which to the an day on the last of the at one must was the for as it to its and <sssss> mention Yet he does not of to in 5 * <sssss> are thing Some missing book from 's entire America words the and <sssss> seen As above America was money its Europe and Europe alone from all the world around the War before and after the War before and after the <sssss> is But what me to quite an does that once not mention about any American America in or not or East the matter for that <sssss> who are well world of the them around will be support of America 's for and other America throughout and the East far example for self which were for alone or it is that author the is that American the and countries were a Europe to the and mention no them of <sssss> found A complete by can be on * 6 is There one put as I it which argument the entire book of this <sssss> results approach 's which power to the word terms only in of military and in a which is the for his <sssss> world the and left Europe in particular is with two follow that they either US the or be a <sssss> due reason The he conclusion this put as I it is view to his <sssss> says than US the as a down by realize leaders American should that they are hardly all at that Europe is not really of US the <sssss> He claim this book throughout his see <sssss> author The 's facts about highly and has to the claims of his <sssss> has errors serious here by Europe 's military not but political and indeed <sssss> With a of * Book the and still growing the leave aside Europe can not be simply or aside as a dead or culture a <sssss> enough Europe is strong to to wants US the as and when it problems the recent over the and more many have all much that Europe 's economic is of a US for the <sssss>
