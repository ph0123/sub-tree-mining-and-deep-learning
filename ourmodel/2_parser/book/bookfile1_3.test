...are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better.
Of course if his models were worth more than the paper they're written on Mandelbrot wouldn't have to write books like this because he'd be cleaning out everyone else's wallets on the stock market.
In particular, if it's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative.
But the fact is, Mandelbrot doesn't know anything that countless other traders don't already know.
So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street.
But I am glad I read this book.
Having seen Mandelbrot 'on tour' a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him.
But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified.
He can never just state a fact.
Instead he always has a to phrase it as "my work shows that..." or "I demonstrated that..." even if he makes the same claim again and again.
If he can try to take credit for other people's work he'll do so.
He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution.
The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his 'Everest' of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit.
Disgustingly he doesn't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians.
One time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can't be all bad.
But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system.
Astonishing!
I think it's also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it's not completely valueless.
But I found the discussion of multifractal time methods (which make up a large part of the book) to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless.
I work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time, but it doesn't mean I have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces.
It just means I know how to fool the eye
I have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly.
There are a lot of good books out there, Dan Harrington's the very best, but this isnt one of them.
Too much ego here and not enough helpful information
This book is for lovers of Robicheaux.
His demons seem put to rest, redemption seems almost within his grasp - and yet the worst mayhem ever occurs within these pages.
The poetry and sense of regret for lost innocence pervade Burke's prose as always, but his anger at humanity's shortcomings is bubbling volcanically just beneath the surface.
Hurricane Katrina features as a force both of destruction and cleansing.
A bit like Robicheaux himsel
Businesses cannot exist without the IT and vice-versa.
They are interdependent.
IT systems automate the business processes and run 24 by 7.
Therefore we cannot really view those who work at the "Business" level as above us.
So, I disagree with the author on this point.
However, he does sort of make a U turn later on in the book.
This book will make you think.
For instance: What is the supply demand for programmers in a particular Business domain?
This would be a good question to research so that we can plan our career.
He talks about how to survive layoffs by being knowledgeable in different areas.
Not everyone wants to stay in one organization for a long time.
Another thing is that it is almost impractical to learn everything in a particular technology (say, Java technology).
Developers will have different intentions, for example they might have a backup plan in case of IT downturn, either by having a cash cushion or generating cash flow through software products.
I agree about following your passion.
It enables us to transcend limitations.
It inspires us and makes us reach a level of performance that amazes us.
This explains the previous paragraph (which sounds like excuses).
Another principle that he explains - "Be the Worst" is very real.
Two projects, one early in my career where I had the opportunity to work with a strong and talented team of developers and project manager.
Recently when I found working for people who were not anywhere near my capabilities, they did affect my performance.
This book helps to see and expect what the work environment could possibly bring us and what we can do to proactively handle these situations.
Maintenance is seen as a menial work and recruiters downplay any experience on it.
Oh, this is a developer job... Chad advises you to learn to love maintenance.
He recommends having a mentor and I am glad I read his book.
I know mentors can also come in the form of a book!!!
You can have more than one mentor.
I love the Eight-Hour Burn concept.
This explains why I get very depressed and productivity drops during the last few weeks of the project.
Now I know how to make the work stay in the office.
No more nagging problems following me home!
The concept of "Presence" is very realistic.
I learned this by making mistakes in the workplace and the cost was high.
I wish I had read this book early in my career.
Lot of things that he explains has already happened to me in my career.
Still I was able to learn how to handle those situations successfully next time around.
Reading open source code really helps to solve recurring problems quickly.
I have experienced this in my job.
The cover of this book really needs to be improved.
The content of the book is much better than the quality of cover image
I'd definitely recommend it not only to the Knowledge Management professionals, but to the general public.
It's a fun and easy read.
Why are there so many insanely positive reviews for this book?
Honestly, what has this author contributed to the world with this book?
Was it the characters?
No, they've all been used and reused and used some more in practically every other work of fiction in the last fifty years (i.e.
cocky and handsome FBI agent, beautiful but dangerous killer with a past, take-no-sh#t FBI boss, etc.).
Was it the deep insight into the characters themselves?
A laugh out loud, "No!".
There was nothing coming close to character development.
Was there some new and clever writing style?
Unless you count having two page chapters revolutionary (I call it a way to have a two hundred page novella turned into a four hundred page novel).
How about the plot?
Was that something worth my time?
Not unless you haven't ever watched suspence movie in your life.
So honestly, what the hell makes this book worth anyone's time?
All I can find in this book are two dimensional characters, needless sub-plots, ludicris dialogue, and empty promises (we're lied to about the main character's fate in the beginning and we're lied to about this being a thriller in the vein of Hitchcock).
As a person who has turned to the world of novels to escape Hollywood's onslaught of needless, pointless, and time wasting strategy of churning out movie after movie of pure garbage I can trully say that this is the type of book that will doom us all into a market of hurried and horribly bad novels to take our hard earned money.
This man does not deserve our money and certainly does not deserve to write anything other than an apology letter to the world for dumbing us down into thinking that this type of writing is anything other than trash
There are plenty of excellent Play Therapy books out there, this is not one of them.
Maybe it's just me, but a play therapy book should be way more user friendly.
I need quick access, color and... ART
V. I. Lenin wrote this book in 1917, while he was hiding from the Russian government.
Lenin pointed out that "The question of the relation of the state to the social revolution, and of the social revolution to the state, like the question of revolution generally, was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the Second International (1889-1914)".
He wanted to correct that oversight, and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book.
"The State and revolution" is a very short book, well structured and not difficult to read at all.
Initially this pamphlet was going to have seven chapters, but Lenin didn't conclude the seventh, due to the outbreak of the Russian revolution.
In the postscript to the first edition he explains that, saying that due to the reasons already explained the conclusion of the seventh chapters would have to be put off for quite a long time, but that all the same "It is more pleasant and useful to go through the `experience of revolution' than to write about it".
The main idea in "The State and revolution" is that the State is a product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms, and an instrument for the exploitation of the oppressed class (a "special coercive force" that rules through violence).
The State of the bourgeoisie will disappear, but only through a revolution that will take the people to the dictatorship of the proletariat.
The proletariat (the working class) will become then the ruling class, "capable of crushing the inevitable and desperate resistance of the bourgeoisie, and of organizing all the working and exploited people for the new economic system.
The proletariat needs state power, a centralized organization of force, an organization of violence, both to crush the resistance of the exploiters and to lead the enormous mass of the population -the peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and semi-proletarians- in the work of organizing a socialist economy."
The dictatorship of the proletariat will be only a first stage in the path to Communism ("Then the door will be thrown wide open for the transition from the first phase of communist society to its higher phase, and with it to the complete withering away of the state").
According to Lenin, the necessity of systematically imbuing the masses with the idea of the necessity of violent revolution lies at the root of the entire theory of Marx and Engels.
All throughout this book, Lenin cites and examines Marx and Engels' writings, in order to explain and support his own point of view.
The importance of Marxism for nowadays world has diminished enormously, but I advice you to read this book nonetheless.
It is certainly not a grueling task, and it will allow you to understand better some notions that many Marxist leaders believed with all their hearts.
Ideas drive men, and men make history.
"The State and revolution" will help you to get acquainted with some of those ideas, and that is not a small feat.

This book is almost useless for helping someone understand how to use acupressure to alleviate physical symptoms.
As a licensed massage therapist who already knows quite a bit about acupressure, I am always willing to learn more about any kind of bodywork.
I had hoped to be able to pass on some ideas to my clients for self help but this book was definitely not it.
The book gives some accupoints for specific problems, some of these are "golden points" able to stand alone in use, but others are not.
The book gives no order to use these in and furthermore does not specify if all or any of the points are to be used together in sequence, or not.
Also,it does't tell where the points are EXACTLY.
There are really too many flaws to go into here.
Acupressure is very complex, this book tries to simplify it to the point that it looks like some goofy folklore advocating some bad mojo
My daughter loves this book.
She reads me poems and stories from this book all the time.
I think all teenagers should purchase this book.
Sure, I had fun reading this book.
But the Amazon reviewer who termed it "highly speculative" is understating the case.
Opinion, conjecture, hearsay, and speculation too often take the place of thorough, solid documentation.
And unlike many other Amazon reviewers, I found McLellan's tone off-putting.
She alternates between patronizing her subjects (the very notion of calling them "my girls," for instance) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader.
Is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant?
You bet.
But is the topic of lesbianism in Hollywood well-served here?
I don't think so
After reading a book of Sandra Brown's that I horribly disliked, I was hesitant to give her another shot.
I'm truly glad I did; The Witness was a first-rate thriller!
The villains in this book are greasy, sick individuals that rather turned my stomach...just what you like when you want to get a taste of Why A Person Would Run For Their Life!
Sandra Brown wrote these characters (and that of Ricki Sue-who I could easily picture!)
particularly well.
The baby was truly the icing on the cake: this infant motivated Kendall throughout the book and, like any mother, lived for the love of her child.
I also loved the sexy, romantic element here-it was just enough that it didn't overwhelm the story...even better, it didn't change Kendall into a mindless goober (a state which many female characters in "romance" novels often achieve.)
The Witness succeeded on so many levels yet fell short of a full five-star rating.
Perhaps it was the Crooks...they came off a bit cliche, but were still necessary characters.
Still, this book is an excellent, thought-provoking choice with a WOW ending.
Very enjoyable
No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.
The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why.
And that is where it falls apart.
The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?
To bury what is already out in the open?
The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy.
What are they trying to silence?
Nothing at all.
Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself
I love this book!
I love this series and it absolutely pains me to think that this may be the last (I say maybe because originally Buddies was supposed to be the last).
It is such a difficult book to pick up and read because every emotion invested in the previous three books is tested.
My love for Dennis Savage's irony becomes sorrow at the hope that he will lose face and stay with Little Kiwi.
My love for Little Kiwi's innocence becomes concern for his actions.
It's like watching your child make questionable decisions and knowing that no matter what the result, the choices that they make are theirs, and there's nothing you can do about it, but let them be chosen.
It's hard letting Little Kiwi grow up and become Virgil Brown.
I imagine it's the same way with a child, but at least then you get to see what happens!
Mind you, the book like the other three is a comic genius with subtle, feeling humor that has you laughing one minute and crying the next.
But just like pppppppppp quot;Just Above My Head pppppppppp quot; by James Baldwin (which I highly recommend), I have been unable to pick up this book and read it again.
It simply leaves me realing with so many feelings, yet I would not trade the experience reading it with anything.
How does one mix merriment with malaise so well?
Read the book and find out
For those who love historical texts, but sometimes have a hard time weeding thru the period language, overly technical jargon and miles of microfiche, this book is a real blessing.
The author not only deals with the methods of tracking, chasing and boarding prey, but goes happily in-depth about the people who follow the "sweet trade".
He covers the buccaneer lifestyle on land as well as at sea, the events leading up to their rise in influence in the Caribbean, and goes into clothing, food, religion, heirarchy, weapons, flags,choice of ships and cultural relationships.
I picked up this book primarily to confirm or disprove my theories on individual weapons combat during boarding actions and while the techniques are not played up in any great detail,citing the use of powder and grenades over cutlass and knife, the reasonings behind what weapons were used and how unorthodox hand to hand combat could be in closed quarters are sound.
Overall a very enjoyable and informative book!

This books should be called "The random thoughts of a rich old man."
It appears to me someone followed Mr. Buffet around and wrote down what ever he said then thought "how do I present this is a book?, oh how about a random collection of dis-jointed thoughts!
yea that's it!
!
The author had all the elements for a good mystery/suspense except for one thing, the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery.
I find it difficult to believe the author of such noted works as Bag of Bones and The Stand would leave his readers hanging in such a manner.
Fiction should be about conflict and resolution and we have the basis for the conflict.
A body turns up on the beach and the only clue comes from a pack of cigarettes found on the body.
We learn the man was from Colorado but very little else.
If the author had brought the story to a meaning conclusion it might well have been a classic mystery or crime thriller but unfortunately the reader is left to wonder what really happened.
I would recommend a Mary Higgins Clark mystery in place of this boo
Many stories in this book reminds me of the famous essay pppppppppp quot;Silent Spring pppppppppp quot;.
The writing style is extremely accessible to every body and yet delivers a significant amount of knowledge, advice, and sometimes wisdom.
The author carefully explains medical terms and implications, thus easing the reader's mind without using a medical book.
This book is highly recommended to anyone who has a curious mind
This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried.
It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.
I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery?
That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book.
I can't believe that I was asking too much.
Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of "Welcome to Maine!"
I Look for books all the time on this topic to see if there any new moves I can pick up to help shape and tone the stomach area which is a problem for most of us.
I think if you are just starting out this book will help you understand the positions you need to get into but it's going to take alot more than 8 minutes to get results and I have been training for years
congrats on your first victory in eight and a half decades
My daughter received this book for her 7th birthday.
She loves all the details and can read it over and over again.
These pop-ups are amazing!
I would highly recommend this book to anyone with a little princess of their own.
(W is not really number one.)
Ritter's book is best summed up by Ritter in these 4 paragraphs from the Epilogue; "The notion of the war in Iraq resulting from an intelligence failure is very convenient for all parties involved.
The intelligence community can simply say that intelligence is a tricky business, and sometimes you get it wrong.
This, of course, provides a convenient excuse for the politicians, and compliant media, to contend that they were simply acting in the public interest based upon the information they were given...
...In the end, to accept the concept of Iraq as an intelligence failure, one must first accept the premise that the USA was implementing, as its primary objective for Iraq, the Security Council's resolutions on disarmament.
This argument is simpy not sustainable.
The behavior of the United States government and its intelligence agencies during my time as an inspector was not that of a government that was serious about disarmament.
Support for UNSCOM's mission was, at best, tailored to the political imperatives at any given time.
There was a total willingness to compromise the integrity of UNSCOM (and with it the whole notion of multilateral disarmament) for short-term tactical advantages in the battle between the US and Iraqi regimes.
Towards the end of the inspections era, elements of the US government actively sought to make UNSCOM's job more difficult by cutting it off from intelligence sources.
Disarmament was simply not the USA's principal policy objective in Iraq after 1991.
Regime change was.
The CIA was designated as the principal implementer of this policy.
Therefore, when one looks at the March, 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent removal of power of the government of Saddam Hussein, the only conclusion that can be reached is that the CIA accomplished its mission.
Iraq was, in fact, a great intelligence victory, insofar as the CIA, through its manipulation of the work of the UN weapons inspectors and the distortion of fact about Iraq's WMD programs, maintained the public perception of an armed and defiant Iraq in the face of plausible and plentiful evidence to the contrary.
We now know that both the US and UK intelligence services had, by July 2002, agreed to 'fix the intelligence around policy'.
But the fact remains that, at least as far as the CIA is concerned, the issue of 'fixing intelligence around policy' predates July 2002, reaching as far back as 1992 when the decision was made to doctor the intelligence about Iraqi SCUD missile accounting, asserting the existence of missiles in the face of UNSCOM inspection results which demonstrated that there were none.
As an American, I find it very disturbing that the intelligence services of my country would resort to lies and deceit when addressing an issue of such fundamental importance to the security of the USA.
Intelligence, to me, has always been about the facts.
When intelligence is skewed to fit policy, then the entire system of trust that is fundamental in a free and democratic society is put at risk.
Iraq, and the role of the CIA in selling the war with Iraq, is a manifestation of such a breach of trust."
We've been had.
On the Grand Scale.
The problem of "politicization of intelligence" is clearly a bi-partisan issue.
I'm recommending this book for anyone who seeks the truth about Iraq's WMD's.
I'm giving this book 5/5 stars just for delivering up the truth, damn the consequences
I wanted to be interested in this book, but it became pretty boring ater a while.
There is an undercurrent of romanticism that pervades the authors purpose.
He claims to be neutral, yet his descriptions and conversations with many of the people slant towards idol worship.
Although the author claims to be in recovery, I did not get the sense of how drugs and alcohol can ruin peoples lives.
I felt that his narrative was self serving, and glorifying the wonders of drugs and experimentation.
There is a price to pay.
What was good was hearing his father's take on the whole down side of watching his son grow up loaded.
That was interesting.
I'm getting weary of the proselytizing about how epochal the 1960's, 70's and 80's were.
I didn't like his picture either
The official censes of the Ottoman Empire in the early 1900s showed well over five million Christians living in the provinces of what are now modern Turkey.
Western specialists who helped the Turks conduct their censes stated that the Turks purposely undercounted the Christians and overcounted the Turks.
So, there were many more than just five million Christians.
There are now approximately only a hundred thousand Christians in Modern Turkey.
The question that the author pointedly neglects to address is what happened to the difference between over five million in the early 1900s and only a hundred thousand people today.
We know that over a million surviving Greeks were expelled in the exhange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923.
Again, what happened to the huge difference of 4-5 million people?
To the 1.5 million massacred Armenians, must be added three quarters to a million Assyriac Christians (Aramaic-speaking Arab Christians) and as many as two million Greeks (almost 30 percent of the Greek people).
The author does not touch on the large numbers of Christians who were enslaved by Turks or forced to convert to Islam to avoid massacre which explains the large number Greek-speaking "Turks" around Trebizon on the Black Sea.
It is not as if there is not vast contemporary accounts of neutral and Western observers of this enormous genocide and ethnic cleansing of the original, pre-Turkish populations of Anatolia.
I can only conclude that the author had such an inborn bias in favor of Turkey as to ignore a slaugher that approaches the Jewish holocaust of WWII.
Avoiding this subject amounts to holocaust denial.
The Christian genocide was the first great genocide of the 20th century and Hitler's model for the Jewish genocide.
The massacre of the Greek and Armenian population of Smyrna (now Izmir) ranks with the Rape of Nanking in sheer horror and scale, but the author skips over it in a rush to avoid any detail of the crime or assign any blame except to the Greeks and Armenians by repeating the discredited canard that they set fire to their own city.
The author's treatment of the Christian genocide reminds me of the comments to me of a Turkish officer at a NATO conference which were to the effect that there had been no Armenian genocide (the Turkish Government official line) but, in any case, that they had deserved it.
The author seems to have taken her treatment of the subject from the Turkish Government as well
Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general.
Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags
pppppppppp quot;The Shaman's Apprentice pppppppppp quot; presents more information about the relationship between people and nature than many much larger volumes.
The story of Kamanya, Gabriela, and the shaman Nahtahlah, educates children about the important roles of all living things.
The text is supported by rich and colorful illustrations which easily maintains the interest of children from four to 14.
If you want the children in your life to understand the importance of rain forests and the need to preserve them, you must have this book
Hunt this book down.
Read "The Bet" (pp.
131-134).
Put this book down.
Leave the store satisified knowing that you have read the only humorous story in this collection.
Sure you could read some other stories in the book, but they're so terribly unfunny that you will invariably come to hate yourself and everyone around you for being in a store that carries this dreadful book.
The only way these stories could possibly be funny is if they were somehow adapted for a series of SNL skits, in which McSweeney's unfunniness were somehow reversed by the lens of SNL's unfunniness.
Come to think of it, this book is just as awful as SNL, except that you can't change the channel.
You're just stuck there on the subway wishing you'd picked up that AM Metro, desperately trying the read the Wall Street Journal (or even the Daily News) over the shoulder of the person next to you.
Anything - just anything - to avoid the tears of boredom that come from reading this garbage.
So, If you like late-model SNL and you can read, you may like this.
But I doubt it
This is a wonderful book, which my children adore, and which taught them each to recognize the instruments in the orchestra before they were three
To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.
One hardly knows where to start.
Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.
As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.
Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.
The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.
Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.
One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.
God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.
Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?
Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?
These were writers who actually made you THINK.
LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.
They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.
One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.
These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.
Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.
If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind
Without question a book is needed to address the origin and history of late night television and Steve Allen's pivitol role it.
Sadly Ben Alba's "Inventing Late Night: Steve Allen and the Original "Tonight Show'', is not that book.
It is, largely, a poorly edited and self-contradicting pastiche of previously published memoirs by Allen himself combined with some excellent interviews with Allen's TV contemporaries.
These interviews could form the basis of an excellent book by the likes of biographers Scott Berg (Sam Goldwin) or Neal Gabler (Walter Winchle).
The opening chapter, which addresses Allen's dysfuntional up-bring, education and his early days in radio and TV sets the stage for the author's failure to create a full-blooded, well-rounded analytical portrait of Allen and his work.
Alba draws here, almost exclusively and certainly uncritically, from Allen's memiors while combining these words with one quote from a childhood friend and two early reviews.
Taking Allen and the reader's one independent witness at face value, Allen had a rootless, violent and unstable childhood.
Given these negative conditions Alba gives no hint of how, why or even if, Allen really remained attached to his drunken and generally unstable mother and her equally troubled extended family.
The author gives us two brief stories from Allen's adulthood to demonstarte that the family ties endured.
Actually, all the stories show is that Allen attended an uncle's funeral and very briefly troted his mother out once on his Sunday night show.
How did this dysfunctional world of Allen's youth effect his two marriages and five sons?
Why, after a childhood on the fringes of a perlious show business existance did Allen choose this same career field for himself?
Alba doesn't even pose such questions about the boy's effects on the man.
He just plows ahead in a haliographic haze.
Throughout "Inventing..." Alba maintains this pattern of unquestioning acceptance Allen's words.
No other witnesses are called, no other points of view are examined.
Steve tells a story; Alba accepts it and edits it into his text.
Why not read Allen straight?
Anna Anderson/ Anastasia I have researched this great mystery for some time now and I have concluded that the woman, Anna Anderson, could not have been an imposter.
Not only did she never give any signs of playing a part, but she was in posession of all sorts of little facts and information that no one on the outside could have known.
She knew of Gleb Botkin's paintings before he even came to see her, she knew exactly what she and her sister Tatiana had been doing while WWI was being declared for Russia (this was confirmed by Dr. Rudnev who was visiting Russia and saw Anastasia and Tatiana at that time), she had intimate knowledge of every single royal house in Europe, and could recognize her royal cousins- sight unseen- by their voices alone.
One must wonder how a demented Polish farming girl could do that.
Aside from just her character, there the many scars and lacerations on her body, as well as the bunions on her feet identical to Anastasia and the cautorized mole on the shoulder which was verified to have been on the young Anastasia as well by a standart officer who did not even support Anna Anderson's claim.
For over six decades, Royal cousins and friends to Anastasia would try and trip this woman up with tricks.
They would misstate things just to see if she would catch them and she always would.
It is virtually impossible for someone to go 65 years without ever being caught in a mistake.
Anna had people such as Alexei Volkov and Alexadra Tegleva in tears after having met her because they were so touched.
No one has ever yet attempted to explain why Ambassador Zahle and Grand Duke Andrew's papers are still kept secret, why Doris Wingender touched up her photographs in court, or why Pierre Gilliard had his scandalous midnight 'burning' of evidence.
To this day, anthropologists who compare Anna Anderson's face, ears, and handwriting specimens to the young girl she claimed to be declare with certainty that the "two" women are the same.
The Franziska Schanzkowska story is clearly a lie from beginning to end.
Anna Anderson was several inches shorter than Franziska Schanzkowska, wore a size shoe three inches smaller, was not mentally insane like Franziska, she spoke a bad German while FS spoke German as her first language, and could understand Russian.
The Schanzkowska siblings did not understand a word of Russian when spoken to them.
AA clearly understood Russian.
Anderson also gave birth to a child.
There is no record of Franziska ever having a child.
Recent documents also show that Schanzkowska was never injured in the grenade explosion which supposedly infliced the wounds on Anna Anderson's body.
The DNA tests have won the hour, but I hope the future will see the release of Ambassador Zahle and GD Andrew's papers to cast even more doubt on this.
Richard Schweitzer's switch theory is very probable given the doubts about the identification with Schanzkowska as well as the security measures which were not that good at Martha Jefferson Hospital during the complicated court battle between Marina Botkin Schweitzer and the Russian Nobiltiy Association.
According to Massie's book, one researcher was even allowed access to the intestinal tissue during this time.
Is it reasonable that the Royal families would ignore the fact that Anna Anderson was about to recieve recognition as the Tsar's daughter after they had been fighting to disprove her all her life?
In any case, the body of Anastasia is still missing, although in Russia there lies a body under the coffin which reads 'Anastasia' measuring 5'7, despite the fact that Anastasia was the shortest of her sisters.
If this isn't reason enough to be suspicious that there is some sort of agenda, I don't know what is.
I'm afraid however that the body lies in the ashes spread over Castle Seeon under the stone which reads, "Anastasia Manahan 1901-1984".
To end this, I will quote Empress Alexandra's best friend (aside from Anna Vyrobouva) Lili Dehn, who met Anna Anderson in 1957(?)
and declared, "Don't bother to tell me she has read these things in books.
I have recognized her physically and intuitively, through signs which do not decieve.
What can I say after having known her?
I could not have been mistaken."
This is to explain my conviction that Anna Anderson was Anastasia.
I think there is something about the DNA we do not know.
The File on the Tsar- 2002 edition... p. 362 'Nearly fifty years ago, Anna Anderson told a story about a sketch she and her sister had put on to amuse their parents during their confinement in Tobolsk.
She played a male part, she 'recalled', and and had to borrow a man's dressing-gown.
At a pivotal moment in the play, a freak draught made the dressing gown billow up around their thighs, revealing that she was wearing the tsar's long-johns- against the bitter cold of the Siberian winter.
The family, said Anna Anderson, had hooted with laughter.
The only witnesses from the imperial household who would have been present at that scene, and who are known to have survived, were the two family tutors-both foreigners.
One was the English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, and his memoirs were published for the first time in 1975.
They include this account of an incident during amatuer theatricals in Tobolsk.
"The cast," Gibbes wrote, "had its happiest night with an Edwardian farce by Henry Grattan, called 'Packing Up', ... Anastasia took the male part... at the end of the farce the 'Husband' had to turn his back, open his Dressing-gown as if to take it off- Anastasia used an old one of mine... but a draught got under the gown and whisked its tail up to the middle of her back, showing her sturdy legs and bottom encased Emperor Jaguer's underwear...' So far as exhaustive research can establish, only Anna Anderson had ever before told this vivid ancedote, in private and three decades before the Gibbes memoirs appeared.
If Anderson was a phoney, as the seemingly damning DNA evidence now tells us, how did she know the story?
That was one of the myriad puzzles that believers in Anna Anderson had to confront when the scientists delivered their verdict.
Ian Lilburn, a research historian and the only observer to attend every session of the "Anastasia" appeal process in the German courts, had a calmer response than some.
"I think," he said, knowing he sounded like a Luddite and Romanov flat-earther, " there is something we don't know about the DNA."
Maybe after reading you can understand why some of us don't believe the DNA was Anna Anderson's, and why we don't believe she was the tall, size '36 shoe wearing Franziska Schanzkowska who could not have had such exclusive info if she were an imposter.
I received my first copy of this cute album as a gift when I had my first baby.
I had so much fun putting it together that I tracked it down for my second and now for my third.
Telling the story from baby's point of view is fun and gets mom thinking about how baby would really feel about all the firsts in his/her life.
It is an easy album for moms and dads who want to record all the important events that the first year brings, but who haven't joined the scrapbooking craze quite yet.
I love this album and plan to have one for each child
I wanted to like this book, but I found it disappointingly thin.
I wouldn't go so far as the previous reviewer and dismiss it as pppppppppp quot;hopeless pppppppppp quot;, but it's certainly superficial: Postman seems to rely on secondary sources about Enlightenment thought, rather than any deep reading of Enlightenment texts.
The idea of pppppppppp quot;building a bridge to the 18th century pppppppppp quot; seems more like a marketing device, a fresh way of presenting some of Postman's familiar themes, than a serious proposition (He even includes a summary of his pppppppppp quot;disappearance of childhood pppppppppp quot; argument in an appendix).
It's a shame, really, because the Enlightenment has been getting too much undeservedly bad press for far too long, and Postman is correct when he points out that we owe much of what's good and admirable about contemporary society to Enlightened thinking.
For a much more substantial survey and defence of Enlightenment thought and culture, read Roy Porter's _The Creation of the Modern World: The British Enlightenment_
Or so my wife tells me... she photocopied half the frozen yogurt section from the library before deciding we should buy the book.
So far as I can remember, they were all good
My name is Big Samad Sefiane, I have been writing screenplays and making music since the age of 13.
The only problem with that book which came out in feb. 2004 is very much a like my screenplay I have written and copyrighted before he released his book.
I wouldn't rate a book, singer or songwriter who takes other peoples ideas and mixes it with his work.
The book is too much similar to my screenplay Entitled HACKERS.
After sept. 11, 2000 mail slowed down and it took me a year to copyright my screenplay.
The screenplay as visible on the internet and also sent to strattford career institute for editing.
The similar scripts will be reviewed by an entertainment attorney
This was, by far, one of the most inspirational books I have ever read.
The ramifications of this book have had far reaching effects on all aspects of my life.
This is a must read for anyone going through a custody dispute.
The author really knew what she was talking about
Gilbert Ryle shows a great skill in condensing his whole argument in a succinct metaphor.
On page 16, he writes: "A foreign stranger visiting the Oxford campus is shown libraries, department buildings, and museums.
Then he asks "But where is the University?".
This is the "category mistake".
Cartesian question "Where is the mind?"
has a same confusion, he asserts.
A famous epigram "Ghost in the Machine" is sometimes misinterpreted.
His point is that there is NO "ghost".
What we think ghost (spirit) does not exist (therefore ghost!).
Although the philosophy of ordinary language and the logical behaviorism, the British school represented by Wittgenstein and Ryle, had an its apogee in 50's, its crux of reasoning still has an important element.
I still feel the current dominant school in cognitive science such as functionalism has a long way to go, before it can make it acceptable for broader spectrum of scientists whose prime mode of thinking is purely materialistic or physicalistic.
Throughout my read, my head kept shaking with disappointment.
If the pppppppppp quot;renaissance pppppppppp quot; of hard SF relies on stories a full decade, even two decades, old, then the genre's future is feebly fixated on its past.
Not to say that some of the stories here aren't wonderful ... emphasis on pppppppppp quot;some.
pppppppppp quot; But dredging dead decades to claim a rebirth of hard SF fails to deliver on the title's promise.
This is more nostalgia than renewal, and you should read a library-borrowed copy if you want to reminisce about great writers past/passing.
But don't drop any real money expecting a glimpse into Sci-Fi's future
This is a fairly helpful book for those born before the '70s-- a time when "a yarn" wasn't an archaic term.
Does it give some helpful hints?
Sure, there's the obvious ones like show don't tell and all characters have free will.
But fiction has changed a lot since Henry James (thankfully), and this book might be better left unread.
Plus, I don't buy the "only people who aren't well-read don't like it" argument.
I've read nearly all the books mentioned and I still wish I never bought this book
I felt this book was reasonably priced and offered a wide array of helpful fundraising advice -- especially for the small to mid-sized nonprofit.
It covers a lot of the basics in a writing style that is pleasant to read
Fabulously entertaining novel from Martin Amis which easily eclipses the rather depressing `Information.'
John Self is a blatantly materialistic hedonist who works as a profitable director of commercials.
He is an alcoholic, a misogynist, and a microcosm of mainstream American culture in the 1980's.
John has also landed a gig directing a feature film, titled `Good Money,' and `Bad Money,' depending on what day of the week it is.
Amis' writing is mordantly brilliant; both acerbic and biting.
There are transactions in here that I just love, such as John's stinging interactions with his girlfriend Selina: " `I've just gone off sex,' said Selina this morning, as she finished the tea I fondly brought her.
`So?'
I asked her.
`God, be nice.
Use your imagination.
It'll pass.
I've just gone off sex.'
Then what do you think is the point of you?
I wanted to say.
But I didn't.
I resisted the temptation.
I looked into the proud drama of her face, the valves and orbits of her throat, the wetlook runnels of her hair, the breasts, heavier than ever, solidly mounted on the ribcage, the naked slopes of the belly, the sudden flaring of the hips, a smell of sleep.
`Then what do you think is the point of you?'
`You', she said, `are unreal' (226).
You should read Amis for his remarkable power of description, his talent for black comedy and middle-aged disillusionment.
Pay little heed to his flights into post-modernity, they are merely exercises in literary chic.
It's pretty impressive to think that a book like "Hiroshima" was written, and appreciated, less than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped.
John Hersey took a bold step in investigating the lives and experiences of those who were on the receiving end of the birth of the Atomic Age.
Interviewing six survivors, Hersey assembled a snapshot of what it was like have an atomic bomb dropped on your city.
Pure luck and circumstances determine if you survive or not.
The color of your clothing means everything.
White clothes reflect the heat, while dark clothing absorbs it.
Even if you survive the initial blast, what you see next might make you wish you hadn't.
But human beings are stubborn creatures, and seem to keep going even in the most hellish circumstances.
I have been to the Hiroshima Peace Park several times, and have seen the human face of the atomic bomb up close and personal.
It is a humbling experience, and one that forever changed my opinions on war as a means of settling disputes.
Hersey's book has a similar impact, being told in such a clinical, observational writing style that you can't help but be moved by the reality of it all.
My one criticism of "Hiroshima" is the cast of characters that Hersey chose to showcase.
For some reason, they seem to be largely Christian, including a German Jesuit priest and a Japanese Methodist minister.
With Christians being such a tiny percentage of the Japanese population, considerably less than 1%, the choice to interview Japanese Christians seems a deliberate one.
Hersey is telling the largely-Christian US readers, "See?
They aren't heathen devils.
They are Christians, just like you and me.
That's who we dropped the bomb on.
That's who we killed."
This puts in question the journalistic neutrality of the book, and has Hersey in the light of putting across an agenda instead of simpling reporting what was
Hugh Hewitt is right on target encouraging Republicans to remain loyal to President George W. Bush.
We are confronted with a long term fight against Islamic nihilists.
The Democrats who dominate that party nationally are essentially pacifists trapped in the mindset of the countercultural excesses of the 1960s.
Indeed, if the Democratic Party returns to power, the war on terror will be severely compromised---if not lost.
Even theological modernists like myself recognize that the Republican Party also best represents the values required to underpin a viable social order.
And yes, we need to purify our ranks and rid ourselves of back stabbers like Senator Lincoln Chafee.
But what about the Republican crybabies who threaten to severely damage the party if it fails to cater to their excessive demands?
These folks may be our greatest threat in the elections of 2006.
Many of them possess a suicidal Nietzschean streak.
In their heart of hearts, they idiotically believe we should let the Democrats win so that the Republican Party can be "purified."
The author has yet to sufficiently deal with this crisis.
Hopefully, he starts to do so real soon before it's too late.
The crybaby Republicans are particularly dangerous concerning the explosive illegal immigration issue.
A number of them come across as nativists who despise Hispanics.
We cannot, however, forget that the children of numerous illegal aliens are often American Citizens.
They get to vote at the age of 18---and will most certainly seek revenge on the GOP for harassing their parents.
Let's get something straight: we are also not going to send an estimated 10-12 million people back to their original homeland.
But aren't these individuals breaking the law?
Human law is not about the striving for utopian perfection.
Yucky sausage making compromises are occasionally required.
I may have a few complaints about Hugh Hewitt's newest book.
Still, you need to purchase a copy.
His overall advice is indispensable if you truly love your family and wish to protect the United States from ruin.
David Thomson Flares into Darkness
I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway.
I wouldn't recommend it.
TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks.
The movie was the same way
I've been staring at a copy of Thomas Friedman's 'From Beirut to Jerusalem' on my shelf for nearly a year now, meaning to read it but always drawn to something else.
Finally, recent events demanded that I learn more and I finally pulled it down, dusted it off, and read it.
I'm so glad I did, especially now.
The book is not the easiest read, since it delves into a lot of regional history and politics, which gets complex no matter what you do.
Friedman's writing style, however, goes a long way towards making the text quite accessible for just about anyone, and his unique perspective on the events that he witnessed and covered in his role as a journalist keeps it interesting and always relevant.
What I really appreciated about the way Friedman presents his story is that it really is HIS story.
He is obviously a man gifted with a keen sense of observation, and so he picks up on many details others might miss, such as the faces of Israeli soldiers or the opinions of Lebanese taxi drivers.
But still, the story is told mainly through events he observed directly -- he just happened to be there for many of the events that shaped the Middle East as it is today.
He tells it in both large and small terms, from some of the politicians he met and interviewed to discussions he had with neighbors and colleagues while living in the region.
The result is that you get the broad spectrum of what was going on in the region, particularly in the 1980's, a critical decade of events.
I also appreciated Friedman's fairness throughout the book.
From his perspective on the Lebanese government to the Palestinian intifada to the Israeli occupation to the American involvement in the region, he deals with all of the players fairly, whether big or small, famous or unknown.
That's not to say he doesn't have criticisms -- certainly, he has plenty to say about everyone...but one is never left with the feeling that he has been too harsh on one side and lenient on the other.
Friedman's willingness to observe with an unbiased eye and ear is key to the strength of this book.
Even with the newer added chapters, dealing with the late 1980's and early 1990's, this book cannot be considered a "complete" history of the Middle East, or even of the events of the last 50 years.
However, it is not meant to be that, I think.
What Friedman has documented here is an excellent primer for anyone interested in learning more about how we got to where we are today in Lebanon and Israel and Palestine.
The book is not an end in itself, but for someone who wants to learn more about the region that is in the news almost every day, this is an excellent place to start.
The only way to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past is to learn from them.
As such, 'From Beirut to Jerusalem' should be required reading today
Before purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews.
The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead.
As it turns out I made the best decision.
All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers'; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price.
My statement has nothing to do with the author's writing skills, he is a skilled writer.
It has everything to do with his lack of insight.
That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.
I read the book, waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.
But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.
Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Paul's life hard.
Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.
He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.
If you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.
If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.
As I read this book I felt sadness, a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.
(There are white folks who actually still think like this.)
My hope is that the light comes on for Paul, he is still young.
If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.
The book had so much promise, but I find it to be disappointing in several ways, alas.
The recipes I've tried have been delicious, and the instructions accompanying those recipes are fairly clear and authoritative, although the discussions and instructions don't rise to the level of a cooking teaching tool, as would, for example, anything by Julia Child, Marcella Hazan, Jacques Pepin, or any of the King Arthur Flour baking cookbooks, all of which really teach one new skills while providing wonderful recipes.
In this case, I was already pretty experienced at making ice cream before I bought the book.
Were I a tyro, I don't think this book would be the best introduction, although of course there is nothing like plunging in and trying.
My biggest disappointment, though, is the organization of the book: ice cream recipes are "bundled" with their accompanying cookies, garnishes, and the like; instead of a group of recipes for chocolate ice cream, for example, we have a group of recipes for ice cream sandwiches, with ice cream of any of several different flavor families.
One has to dig around in the index at the back of the book to find, say, recipes for chocolate ice cream.
I would much prefer to have an index or table of ice cream recipes, by flavor and page number, right up front -- I don't want to spend so much time looking for the flavor I want.
My next disappointment is that the text is printed in a graphically attractive and most stylish but virtually illegible size and color.
My middle-aged eyes struggle desperately to read the book, even with my reading glasses on, and I surely can't prop the book 18-20" back from my utensils, to read as I work without changing position, as I like to do with my cookbooks.
This is a case in which the author and editorial team seemed to have chosen (admittedly very attractive) style over function.
The book IS very attractive, and the photographs are lovely -- but I would gladly sacrifice some beauty in favor of being able to read the recipes and discussions more easily.
My final disappointment is in the complexity and elaborateness of most of the "dessert packages," for lack of a better word.
Making the ice cream or sorbet and its accoutrements is, in most cases, a tremendously labor-intensive exercise.
I have opted for using some of the creative and delicious ice cream recipes and figuring out my own much simpler and easier garnishes and accompaniments.
I work a demanding job and have a house to run.
I love to cook, but can't devote as much time to making an ice cream sandwich, for example, as these recipes require.
So I use less of the book than I'd wish.
Over all, Ms. Luchetti's sense of style and taste are impressive, and she seems superbly knowledgeable about frozen desserts.
And many of the ice cream recipes are lovely.
But I had hoped that this would be a book I would pull from the shelf much more often than I will, in fact, because the book is so difficult to use
John Crowley's well-deserved recognition as one of the best literary stylists writing in the English language is readily apparent in these four fantasy novellas that date from the late 1980's.
His pppppppppp quot;Great Work of Time pppppppppp quot; is an intriguing Rashomon-esque time travel fantasy about Cecil Rhodes and British economic imperialism in East Africa at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.
It was almost as compelling a read as the pppppppppp quot;The Nightingale Sings At Night pppppppppp quot;, which offers a fantastical twist on the Adam and Eve creation myth saga.
The other two tales, pppppppppp quot;In Blue pppppppppp quot; and pppppppppp quot;Novelty pppppppppp quot;, I found much less compelling, but they are redeemed by the same lyrical prose Crowley uses in other tales.
It was a wonderful surprise to find this book at a library; a surprise which I think many readers will also discover
If you look at the March 2004 issue of the International Association of Bloodstain Pattern Analysts, you'll find a very negative review of this book.
Given that the reviewer (Herbert Leon MacDonell, the Director of Laboratory of Forensic Science Bloodstain Institute of Corning, New York) and all members of IABPA actively work in the field of forensics, I'd take their word for it.
Here's an excerpt from the review, which can be found on the web at http://www.iabpa.org/March2004News.pdf "Many fine books have been written on the general subject of forensic science but this is not one of them.
It only takes reading the first page for the reader to discover that this book is not going to be a source of accurate forensic information."
The reviewer goes on to say: "...the frightening aspect is that lay persons who purchase such garbage are unaware of how inaccurate the things they are reading really are.
It is unfortunate that there are publishers out there who will print a manuscript without having some form of peer review to determine whether there are a few minor errors or is it so bad like this book, that they should trash it.
My kids and I love this book.
There were so many cute ideas, several parties worth.
Pirates are a hit with most kids and this book uses this theme combined with simple objects to make things that kids will think are awesome.
I especially liked the recipes, the place cards, the ideas to make with salt dough, and the pirate facts throughout the book
I've long been a fan of Borges the short fiction writer.
But this little book has made me an instant fan of Borges the reader and Borges the literary critic.
I have to admit that so much of petry mystifies me, but within the pages of this book, I felt as if Borges' insight was finally allowing me to understand poetry in a way I hadn't considered before.
Witty, modest and polymathic, Borges shines through the pages of this book.
You can read it in an hour, but if you read it for 1 week straight, you still wouldn't be able to appreciate all the gems of wisdom in it.
Great stuff
As many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction, however midway it turns into a romance novel.
I give it 3 stars for holding my attention.
A good beach read that can get you thinking (a little) about a time past.
The one star is a mistake and I cannot seem to change it.
3 *** stars

I have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more.
The language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words.
These books can cause you embaesment, since I read where ever I have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it.
Please we would all like to see more of these
The premise of this story started off smartly.
I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away.
But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout.
Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache.
I have read one other Case book I think, his "Kingdome Come" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I'm not sure.
But what I am trying to say here is that 'Kingdome Come' was much better than 'First Horseman.'
Its still a little corny, but it reads like a more contemporary Ludlum
She wastes the first chapters, and my time, going to extremes with kooky consultants that only someone who doesn't deserve to be hired would use.
It adds to the drama and despair I suppose, but it comes off as contrived, and as an attempt to pander to her extremist/pessimist reading coterie.
I don't think Babs could have possibly put more words in quotations.
Her OCD with quotated words and terms is a distraction that ultimately drove me nuts.
I can't believe she's an accomplished writer.
Her writing style can best be described as unsmooth and read-stoppage inducing.
Oh well, her intentions were good
Reading WAR AND PEACE is an immense undertaking, which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human.
The first time that I read it, I read it as a novel, for entertainment.
Years later, I picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious.
I sought to know how Tolstoy could justify the ways of God to man.
During this second reading, I was able to examine the Russian names, characters, events, and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through.
What I saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding Epilog, which I scanted then but studied now.
Most readers of WAR AND PEACE find this part heavy going, which it certainly is, but in it, Tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do.
In essence, each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space, with one atom colliding at random with another, but when a sufficient number act in concert, such as Napoleon's invasion of Russia, their force is irresistable.
When Tolstoy introduces world leaders like Napoleon or the Tsar, he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom, who can not see the Big Picture any more clearly than anyone else can.
The tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change.
But when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self-deluding--as when General Kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms, then they are drawing closer to a universal "one" with nature.
This "one" Tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with God.
Tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that "one" or any other deity, but he does say that history, time, and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path, and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go, then he might wish to emulate General Kutuzov, who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going.
This novel is more enjoyable than the Flanders Panel, but still not up to the level of the Fencing Master or his recent series, the Captain Alatriste books.
The characters are well drawn, the setting comes alive, and the story flows.
There are a few sections of the book that need some more editing to make them a bit more crisp, but I cannot tell if that is due to the translation or is in the original.
The only real disappointment came when I finished the book: I wish there was a follow-up
I have been a devoted Hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation.
Although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical, the story is just so silly I found it hard to keep my attention focused.
I compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which I do with my children on occasion.
Sorry, I just couldn't finish it
I enjoyed reading The Mark.
It was definitely a page turner.
Of course it makes me want to continue with the series.
Tim F. LaHaye is a great author and story teller.
I actually visualized the whole the thing.
I would thank him in person if I could, for a wonderful job done...
Thank you..
This book is a big hit with my PRE-K class!
I was pleasantly surprised at how responsive and attentive they were while I was reading this.
They have memorized most of the book.
They all loved it!
An excellent resource for teaching about diversity and various cultures!
I'd definitely recommend reading this book to/with ages four through maybe second grade
I had to read this book for a diversity class.
Sennett uses language and sentence construction that is overly ostentatious and difficult to understand.
Inside this fat book is a very thin book trying to get out.
He needed a good editor.
Wright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of "the road to 9/11."
Understanding Qutb's radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.
What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.
The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.
The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.
After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it.
Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the "friend and enemy" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a "state of exemption."
If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.
See the BBC documentary, "The Power of Nightmares" or "From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.
If you prefer to stick with fiction about "the road to 9/11," check out Patrick S. Johnston's novel "Mission Accomplished.

Line by line, this book has some of the best writing I've seen in a while.
This is an amazing thing, since it's still very fast-moving and not at all overwritten.
The author just has an amazing eye for detail and a very crafty sense of humor.
The book surprised me constantly with its insights, and these characters were so real to me by the end that I missed them for a week.
I read Craig's first book, and it doesn't stand up to this at all.
It's exciting to see how much the writer has improved, and I can't wait for the next one
Peter Robinson is one of my favorite authors.
When I travel on vacation I make sure to take his latest novel.
"Piece of my Heart" transitioned between the present and a time about 25 years ago.
The characters were well developed and the story line moved.
There were many layers of sub-plots that were interwoven.
I thoroughly enjoyed how everything was brought to its final conclusion.
This was an amazing book.
It was one of those where when you read it, you can picture the story in your head, almost movie like.
Feist did an amazing job with descriptions and character developement.
This was my first Fiest book, but I can guarantee you, it wont be my last.
The plot follows a young boy named Kieli and his story of becoming a spy and weapon against those that murdered his village.
The story begins with Kieli on a vision quest, a test to prove he is ready to be an adult.
He must go to a sacred hill and wait for a vision to appear to him.
He then finds that his village has been attacked and that he is the sole remainer of his people.
The story goes on to tell of his quest for vengance and his plot of revenge.
Amazing in every way
A fraudulent marine biologist, whose wife is about to expose his cover-up of phosphate pollution of the Florida Everglades, tries to kill her by throwing her overboard from a cruise ship.
Unknown to him she survives and haunts him to punish him.
It's a wonderfully comic page-turner, although the plot runs out of steam towards the end and the practical jokes played on the would-be murderer become repetitious.
A few ends are left loose.
It challenged comparison with the Florida novels of Elmore Leonard, such as "Maximum Bob" and "Stick" but it does not quite live up to the master.
Some of the humor contrasting weird and wacky Floridians with stolid Upper Midwesterners seemed to derive from David Barry (and Euripides, Ovid and Tasso used the maiden-rescued -from-sea-monster gimmick).
I thought this was his best since "Striptease."
The intervening ones have been too incoherently plotted and (although I'm a tree-hugging whale- lover myself) overloaded with environmentalist politics.
Incidentally, isn't releasing alien snake species into the wild an environmental no-no?
This thing sat on my shelf, half-read for the longest time.
Only the notice of the upcoming release this November of Pynchon's next got me motivated enough to dig into it again.
It's not that it isn't brilliant.
No one else around can dazzle you with so much wit and wonder.
The first encounter with the talking dog is as magical as anything you'll ever read.
And it's not like this is the only Pynchon novel that takes some effort to get into.
There are plenty of folks who have had to to take a couple cracks at V or Gravity's Rainbow before catching the wave.
But Mason and Dixon is a lot of work, if for no other reason than the effort it takes dealing with the mid-18th century prose style.
(Can you imagine the effort it took to produce it?)
John Barth's Sotweed Factor is similar, and yet somehow infinitely more accessible (and highly recommended!).
Pynchon's gift for rapid exposition is not necessarily suited to the constraint on verbal glibness.
Especially in a work this voluminous.
And yet the darn thing is consistently challenging, if one has the patience and energy to put into it.
It seemed to me that the beginning and ending were the best parts, but this could very well have everything to do to the enthusiasm one brings to a new book, and the emotional satisfaction one gain's when reaching towards the conclusion.
One thing for sure, for once Pynchon truly has plotted out and delivers a conclusion worthy of the whole work, as opposed to suddenly rushing out a trap door and leaving the reader in a state of suspension (which of course is also one of the many delights of his first three novels).
This time one gets the sense that the author has a good deal of affection for his featured players.
This book is a great as you want it to be, if you're willing to work at it.
I'm just looking forward to the next one being a little more nimble.
(Meanwhile, I've got a couple months to see if I can make more of a dent into The Recognitions.
I read 1776 shortly sfter having read McCullough's John Adams so some of the same ground was covered but from a different perspective, I found 1776 to be an interesting and smoothly flowing read.
Anyone who has enjoyed and appreciated David McCullough's other works will enjoy 1776
This guy's box is missing a few tools.Most of the stuff he quotes as fact is not supported in real life.
He's full of crap.
Everybody knows walking is good for you, but kevin T. starts his chapter on walking by saying that 'when you take your dog for a walk, he (or she) poops............well la-de-f_____ing-da....isn't that WHY you take your dog for a walk....because you don't want him (or her) to poop in the house.
Then there's his statement that if you put your teflon pan on high heat and have a parakeet on your shoulder, the bird will keel over dead because of the poisonous gasses.......and another thing, who ever heard of an acidic body???
I think I know what planet Trudeau came from....URANU
When you have lost weight, it's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off.
Whenever they have heard me tell my story, read my blog or book, or found out that I did it on the low-carb lifestyle, one question invariably has come up from time to time: "What do you think about this low-carb diet where you can eat whatever you want for one-hour per day?"
My initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this: "That's absolutely crazy!
There's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method."
I did the Atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other low-carb diets out there.
But there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it.
Little did I know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about.
It's called The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs.
Richard and Rachael Heller.
The CAD diet, as it is referred to, makes the claim (and I agree with it) that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance.
Just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less, that same concept is what goes into the CAD diet.
If people think the Atkins diet is restrictive, then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet: BREAKFAST: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.
LUNCH: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.
You are NOT allowed to eat any bread, fruit, milk, juice, and most starchy vegetables.
Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda.
You cannot use artificial sweeteners either.
Sound appealing, anyone?
Hmmm?
I suppose if that's all there was to this diet, then NOBODY would do it.
But there is one more key aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be interested in.
DINNER: Eat equal amounts of protein, vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount, but it must be eaten in a one-hour time frame.
You can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your "reward" meal.
How's that for incentive?
You basically starve all day long just so you can get to those sixty minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line!
Who wouldn't enjoy a diet that lets you do THAT?!
Well, I'm still very skeptical about any lifestyle change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or obese to begin with on a DAILY basis.
I caught a lot of flack from my fellow low-carbers about my controversial "planned splurge" meal every 6-8 weeks during my weight loss.
However, the Hellers give you a DAILY planned splurge!!!
What's up with that?
We can blame this on Dr. Rachael, who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet.
She became a psychologist to learn more about why people overeat (ostensibly to help herself in the process, too).
She had skipped breakfast and lunch on a particular day she was fasting for a blood test and then, like most of us would, ate to her heart's content whatever she wanted for supper.
The next morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds.
Thinking something must have gone wrong with her scale, she tried it again the next day, skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a gargantuan dinner and once again, she lost another pound.
She played around with what would eventually become The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day.
The frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the CAD diet.
The Hellers believe that anyone who consumes ANY amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are hungry faster than if you avoided them altogether.
They say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of small doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict.
It will make them crave their poison even more!
That's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the CAD diet until the end of the day.
This process of getting over carbohydrate addiction is a tricky one, and the Hellers think they have found a solid plan for making it work for lasting weight loss in people.
I still can't get around the fact that you don't change the poor eating habits of the people who have packed on the pounds.
Sure, they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one BIG meal each day, but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the biggest obstacle to weight loss success -- HUNGER!
There's no way I could do the CAD diet because I enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my digestive process constantly in motion.
I truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off.
Since you cannot snack or use artificial sweeteners on the CAD diet, it would literally drive me insane even if there was that "reward" meal at the end of the day!
Wanna take a test to see if you are a carb addict?
Click here to take the 10-question Carbohydrate Addict's Test.
I scored a 2, which means "You do not appear to be carbohydrate addicted."
No kidding, ya think?
Dr. Jonny Bowden, author of Living The Low-Carb Life, examined the CAD diet and said the diet uses some fuzzy science to make their points about why their plan works.
"While it seems pretty clear that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the obese, it's not at all clear that high levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin, as the Hellers hypothesize--in fact, the majority of the evidence points to the opposite response."
Furthermore, Dr. Bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their weight loss program, stating "it's vital to both maintaining weight and to raising the metabolic rate."
While The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet has worked for a lot of people and I always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off, I still have my reservations about this program.
I think I'll pass on carb-loading my body for one hour a day
I finally know what makes for good comic book inks after reading this book.
Gary Martin comprehensively outlines all the elements of comic book inking including the various techniques, styles and methods that the pros use.
Plenty of samples from his own work and that of others.
If you want to learn how to ink comic book art or you just want to know what distinguishes good inking from bad, I highly recommend this book.
The production values, art and cover are also very professional
I approached this title with all the expectations fostered by many friends endless promotions.
I did my best to like it, to find some secret meaning, some redeeming quality within, to no avail.
Actually finishing the book was an accomplishment, in my opinion.
Ultimately I found the book aimless, soulless, and the promoter of everything negative about the human species.
I know this sounds harsh, but time after time I felt let down by On the Road.
No, I don't "dig" it, Dean
All I can say is pass me some aspirin.
This is a dozy of a bad novel.
As it says on the dust jacket, a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased.
Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit.
At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence.
Not only does he deal with his family, but his brothers friend, a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.
And that's only the start of the plot.
Its really pretty bad, it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions.
The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways.
Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors.
If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it.
Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well.
This book is not very helpful and confusing to use.
A lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels IF you buy those brands.
All I could think was, "Damn, if I had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge, I'd never be depressed."
I don't know quite how to explain it, but I felt no empathy for him.
I only ended up feeling more depressed.
As a history of depression, the level of research was quite impressive.
If you read Prozac Nation and wanted to punch her out, steer clear of this one as well
After viewing the German artistic mini-series for television many years ago, I decided to read this German family story to rival Galsworthy's Forsythe Saga.
I was not disappointed, because this book deals, among others, with one essential aspect of human existence: man's difficulty in adapting to hardships and changes in social status.
The story of the Buddenbrooks is a story of moral values among individuals who, although belong to the same family, can be astonishingly different in their understanding of life and their grasp of reality.
In this family we see characters who are able to adapt, understand the world and compromise, while at the same time we are exposed to those who are limited by their own upbringing to a life of limited flexibility and eventual disillusion and self-abandon.
This fundamental book of world literature attacks two antithetic facets of human nature, two views of the world that are constantly at battle within all human beings.
It is for this reason that pppppppppp quot;Buddenbrooks pppppppppp quot; is fundamentally an allegory about man and his internal turmoil with the major challenges of life, a carefully crafted story with psychological insight that makes the reading of this book definitely worthwhil
I had read a book about the French and Indian war, one about the revolution and also the recent best seller,1776.
I found The War That Forged a Nation an excellant addition to my understanding of this important period in American history.
I would highly recommend it.
Very readable
I found Airframe to be a great book to read on my summer vacation.
I was expecting it to be more of a science fiction novel but it is really a book about corporate intrigue and social commentary (i.e.
the media).
That being said, I was not the least disappointed.
In his typical style, Crichton takes an aerospace engineering course and boils it down to plain English.
I learned so much about the construction of airplanes and the airline industry - it was fascinating.
He also does a great job in raking the mass media over the coals - which was fun (and somewhat ironic from the creator of "ER")!
The book is fast paced and reads like a movie - which I am sure is no coincidence by Crichton ;) The main character is very likeable and you find yourself rooting for her.
There are a number of plot twists and surprises and it certainly keeps you turning the pages.
In summary I would not say that this is Crichton's best work, but it is surely a very enjoyable book that I would recommend to everyone
This book may be as well called "the chicken soup for the writing-it-down souls".
The author illustrates her points by telling many uplifting stories.
However, if you are a self-help reader like me who is used to David Allen's "Getting Things Done", you may find that storytelling is distracting and not as convincing as it can
You know the author is good when he can make you tear up for a former KKK member on Death Row.
While the book was a little slow at times, I couldn't wait to turn the page and find out what happens next.
If you like John Grisham, you'll like this book.
Having read (and thoroughly enjoyed) Levitt's Freakonomics, I picked up "Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life" looking for more of the same.
Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed.
I get the impression the author intended to write a Freakonomics-type book, but was only able to come up with 40 pages of material (located at the end of the book).
Facing an irate publisher, he then filled in the initial 290 pages with his old Economics lecture notes.
As a result, readers who have taken an elementary economics course will find much of the material repetitive, while those who have not will most likely find the material too confusing to be of any real use.
(Despite the glowing accolades on the cover, the author's explanations are no better than those available in a standard textbook.)
The author also posits end-of-chapter questions for the reader to ruminate upon, but does not provide any answers.
Aside from formal textbooks where such questions are intended to be assigned to students, such tactics are unconscionable.
Of course, the author may be priming the pump for sales of a "Hidden Order Supplement".
A final negative point is the author's tone, which is frequently condescending towards the reader (e.g.
telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory, so it will not even be presented).
While this may be true for a layperson reading the book, being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the subject matter.
Overall, if you can borrow a copy from a friend or a library, the last 40 pages are worth reading.
Otherwise, save your time and money.

This is wonderful!
It is for fans of Laura Ingalls Wilder, and also for those who are interested in historic cooking - from prairie and colonial days which have their basis in so many of the cultures which settled America in the early days, and adapted for use there This book is a very happy blend of the Laura Ingalls stories and the food which was eaten, interspersed with the recipes and how they would have been prepared and cooked.
Of course Laura didn't include any of the actual recipes in her book and so they have gleaned from similar cookbooks and so on of the day.
It has been adjusted to modern need for exact temperatures and measures.
I found this book so lovely to read through, not just browse through.
The interest factor is great - learning what things were available, and how they were used - baking soda, yeasts, how the oven was used, what cooking items they would have had access too as well as some of the stuff we should know but forget - seasonal food avaialble.
But it is good as a simple recipe book.
It is an incredible look at times gome past one of my best reads in the last few years, I also bought a Prairie cookbook which I would highly recommend as well - it is more of a recipe book than this one, but a lovely complementary book to it
This book was originally published ca 1980 as England and Always.
I have not seen the original so I can't tell how much of this book is new material (beyond a chapter dealing with Peter Jackson's films).
Lobdell has examined Tolkien's writings from several interesting and unusual perspectives.
One of the most interesting deals with the influence of Edwardian adventure fiction (Haggard, etc.)
on Tolkien.
Another fascinating chapter deals with Middle Earth as a Christian world in a pre-Christian age.
There is also a short fiction story in an Appendix which is meant to be a sort of parallel to Tolkien's own abandoned sequel to The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the Shadow.
I enjoyed this story, though of course Lobdell as a fiction writer cannot measure up to Tolkien.
(But then, no one can!)
I am a long time Tolkien reader and addict (since the age of 12 in 1969.)
Most of the time I do not care for Tolkien "criticism" and "literary analysis", which to me seems to suck out the magic, but Lobdell's work is different.
The World of the Rings enhances Middle Earth and intensifies the love I feel for it
I adored this book.
The character development is strong, and delightful!
With the exception of the villain, all characters are likeable.
I couldn't wait to read the next book in the trilogy
I have read some memoirs of the 2nd WW from a German standpoint and this was not one of the better.
Although very fascinating at times it was also oddly detached and some of the stories about his sniping seemed "made up".
It sometimes read as a fiction novel where he was alittle too much superman to be belivable.
I also found it very strange that he very seldomly refered to other members in the squad, i do recognise that sniping surely is lonesome work but still, it was like nobody left an impression or if he held back with intent.
Another thing that is getting tiresome is that is always the russians that are the bad guys doing grizzly things, but he didnt stand for a minute to think what his own country had got himself involved in.
Still a good read but these factors didnt allowed me to be gripped by the story as other memoirs have.
Exposure to Harv Eker's Millionaire Mind Intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago.
I also attended the Guerilla Business School, a $2500 intensive.
What is important to realize is that actually being in a room in the workshops and doing it several days in a row will actually (as it did with me) shift your perspective, if you are at all open to having it shifted.
Getting into a better mindset with regards to prosperity is fundamentally an issue of breaking down old programs and replacing them with new ones.
This book may help you, but the seminar will help you more.
The Millionaire Mind intensive taught me things and set in motion a change in perpective for me.
I am now financially free and well on my way to be wealthy as an internet marketer promoting a website called ZeroDollarMarketer dot com.
Being rich is a matter of perspective.
True wealth is measured for me by the health of my body and mind, my relationships, and lastly my pocketbook.
But its sure good to have plenty left over at the end of the month.
A journey worth pursuing
In the "New Work of Dogs,"author Jon Katz expands his scope from focusing on his relationship with his dogs---a topic he has detailed in previous books---to examining the canine-human relationship on a broader scale.
Informed by arduous research (a two foot stack of papers, books, journals), he sets out and succeeds in making a case that dogs, by-and-large, are doing different work from their traditional herding, hunting, and guarding.
We have pushed our canines into new territory as emotional companions, therapy dogs, even extensions of our egos to help us cope with an increasingly complex world.
The notion that we are growing increasingly isolated as a culture is not new, but seeing how humans are using dogs to cope with a society that no longer maintains the cultural bearings of "the greatest generation" is new (at least to me).
Mr. Katz visits with many dogs and their owners of various social economic strata who inhabit the enclaves of Montclair, New Jersey.
More often than not, he found that dogs are being used as emotional surrogate, a classic situation noted in attachment theory but hitherto mostly applied to other people.
Many of these dogs are pampered, untrained, and confused.
Others are abused to some extent, whether through deliberate actions or through negligence.
The stories are alarming and informing.
I see many of the mistakes I made with previous dogs laid out before me and wonder if my two Australian shepherds are as well-adjusted as they seem.
Many reviewers have commented, and correctly, that anyone planning to own a dog needs to read this book.
Sadly, I think Mr. Katz will largely reach those people who already possess a great deal of knowledge about dogs---those who train their dogs, who buy or adopt breeds suitable for their living conditions or schedules, and who treat their dogs with consistent, loving authority.
Mr. Katz does not make harsh judgments on any of the circumstances he depicts but instead concludes by noting how many dogs are dumped in shelters where they languish or die.
The numbers are staggering.
And he takes matters a step further with the thought-provoking idea that if we have dog rescue groups, how can we not also have their counterparts to reach out to those of our own species in dire need.
With the release of Jasper Fforde's fourth title in the Thursday Next sci-fi/fantasy series, readers will be treated to the culmination of the alternative Earth that the author has spent three books building.
In "Something Rotten," the options for direction for the series are fully realized as the alternate Earth of 1988 and the world of Fiction are completely in place.
When last we left the intrepid Thursday Next, she had just saved the world of Fiction from yet another villain intent on its destruction.
Pregnant and with her husband erased from history by the evil Goliath Corporation, Thursday's finally given birth to a son, Friday, who at two year old only speaks in Lorem Ipsum (a good example of the craziness of Fforde's vision.)
Deciding that her time overseeing the purity of novels has worn thin, she returns to Earth and winds up becoming: * The target of an assassin * The coach of her town's professional croquet team * The thorn in the side of a hypnotic politician who is actually fictional * The hostess to Hamlet, Prince of Denmark * The on-again, off-again wife to her exterminated, unexterminated husband * The finder of a live clone of William Shakespeare * The friend of Neanderthals everywhere * Dead--twice * The holder of the secrets of the apocalypse * The once-again savior of the planet If you think that's about three books in one, well that pegs "Something Rotten."
Fforde packs this book so full of plot and sub-plot that readers must juggle all those narrative balls at once.
That Fforde can bring all this together at the end shows that his mastery of his world has grown since the start of this series, "The Eyre Affair."
While not as inventive as his previous book, "The Well of Lost Plots," Fforde's world-building is largely done, so "Something Rotten" can focus on the story and not on backstory--that's a big plus.
Longtime readers of the series will find that this fourth book finally illuminates some of the backstory that existed even in the first book.
For instance, we finally get to see who Millon de Floss is and get a better look at the genetic experiments that have resulted in an England overrun with mammoths, dodos, and Neanderthals.
All the typical humor that we've come to expect from Fforde is here and he's done well picking up the mantle of Douglas Adams.
Someone has to write nutty British sci-fi and Fforde is doing it about as well as anyone right now.
And while "Something Rotten" is a terrible place for new readers to jump into the Thursday Next books, for fans of the series this is probably the most satisfying of his books.
Enjoy
I seem to keep giving Mr. King all 5 stars.
Well, so what!?
His books are worth it.
I took my time with this book because I knew it was the last one in the series and I didn't want it to end.
The ending will send chills up your spine and you get closer and closer to the Dark Tower.
The journey, the roses, Roland, the history... King is one of the masters!
"Up to the minute".???
Hardly!!
March 2005, the publication date, is a loooong time ago in ipod years, if you have one of the new models, video 60 Gig for example, you will be sorely dissapointed, it talks about the nano and photo i pod as the "latest edition to the ipod family", well they are now teenagers and probably due to be retired at any moment, ipod mini anyone?
Those things are Neolithic now, yet are given too much space in this "up to the minute" book as if they had just been released!
Go to Borders, look thru their ipod books and find the one with your ipod in it, if you have a brand new one as at May 2006.
HACCP is the acronym for Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points.
This text, by Arduser and Brown is the be all and end all on the topic - in my view.
It even comes with a companion CD-ROM that contains all forms from the book in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) and MS Word format.
This is a major time saver when it comes to preparing and administering the required tests to staff members and the newly hired.
The comprehensive 530+ page text covers everything I can think of that relates to food safety in restaurants and other eateries.
It is designed to teach food service managers and their employees the specifics of food safety in accordance with the FDA Food Code.
This excellent training manual is in large print format that makes it easy to read.
The writing is easy to understand and the authors were careful to explain key concepts and terms so that even a novice can study it alone.
The seven comprehensive chapters in the manual cover the following topics: Hazards to Food Safety; Factors Affecting Food-Born Illness; Food Safety Regulations; Following The Flow of Food; HACCP; and the Facility Plan.
These are followed by an extremely helpful Glossary of terms.
The Appendix includes all forms needed to meet the FDA requirements and to run an efficient and safe establishment.
Included are checklists, signage, compliance checklists, and equipment cleaning charts, allergen-control program worksheet along with job descriptions for personnel.
There is even a Certificate of Completion to certify that staff members have taken and passed the required tests (included).
With the rise in reports of food-borne illnesses and deaths it is essential that every food service operation adhere to the regulations and safety procedures at all times.
In my view, this book is essential to ensure you are in total compliance.
As one who has conducted training I find this book deserves 5 stars for its complete coverage of the subject matter in an easy to digest all-in-one format.
I highly recommend this book
Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.
There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.
Ironically, socialist, anti-American, iconoclastic Professor Taylor, could be, at least in this work, the inspiration for the great David Irving's more pathbreaking work on an unneccesary and destructive war.
It is demonstrated that Adolph Hitler, the popular Nationalist German leader, was no more responsible, and in many ways less so, than the so-called Allies, who foolishly guaranteed Poland, only to give her over to jewish Bolshevism at Yalta.
By refusing to grant Germany's rightful place as a continental power, Britain and France lost millions of lives, their world empires, and their economic prominence.
The sole beneficiaries of this needless conflict were the Soviets and their Western fellow travellers.
And upon the final dissolution of the evil empire, courtesy of one Dutch Reagan, we have a European continent completely dominated by...Germany
Ask your favorite Liberal or Socialist the following objective question and you'll quickly find out how totally vile many Liberals, Socialists and Do-Gooders are: "If you, as an elected Government bureaucrat could send a poor, black child to a violent, academically inferior Government public school (K-12) for $15,000 per child per year of taxpayer money, OR, send that same poor black child to a nurturing, academically superior Private or Parochial school (K-12) for $7,500 per child per year of taxpayer money To which school would you, Ms. Liberal, send that child?"
For over 13 years Liberals, Socialists and most Do-Gooders have bravely answered: "I, as a good Liberal, would send that poor black child to the violent, academically inferior Government School!"
Save a poor black kid for $7,500 per year?
or Destroy a poor black kid for $15,000 per year?
And most Do-Gooders and Liberals choose expensive destruction?
Have fund asking your Liberal friends the above question and watch the squirming.
One reviewer of this book said he's sick of investing tomes, they offer no practical benefit except to enrich the authors, who usually run money management firms for which the books are meant to recruit clients.
And of course those firms charge hefty fees, even if their timing is slightly off (say, a few years or so).
Another reviewer loved the book because he realizes he is going to have to work harder to invest successfully over coming years.
If only he had read the book in 1999.
What is not fully understood by many investors is that the money game is run by Wall Streeters with whom you cannot compete and beat over time.
Some of the smartest people in the world work on the Street and they are not sharing what they know with anybody.
But they want you in the game.
They need you.
They take care of their biggest clients (and I mean really big) and every client who is not big is late to the table and last to leave, usually at a loss.
Because smaller clients start buying what the big players are just starting to sell.
Which is why the big holders sell in dribs and drabs over time.
Every winning trade requires a losing trade.
Too bad, past results are no etc.
etc.
Try to work the market independently against the big guns and you will eventually come to know the meaning of whipsaw.
And its consequences.
Everybody thinks they can get out in time.
Trouble is, when markets tank--stock market, real estate markets--there is no getting out because there are no buyers.
It's a free fall without a parachute.
Many real estate speculators will learn this in the coming year.
The author of this book, Ed Eastering, is well respected and can give you a good view of how the game works.
Which is useful in a textbook kind of way.
And he attempts to lay out some tips for the solo investor.
Trouble is, timing IS everything and the information you need to time the market is not going to be found in any book.
Or any proprietary system being peddled over the internet.
If it worked that well they would not be selling it to you.
So what's the answer?
Contrarian investing?
When everybody is long, go short, and vice versa?
Good idea but it requires a discipline that can tear apart the innards of a veteran Wall Street trader.
It is just not wired into the systems of most people to pull it off.
And reliable sell signals are about as hard to find as a legitimate 1918 Inverted Jenny.
Another possibility: do what most of the really rich usually do, stuff it into long-term U.S. Treasuries that pay a fixed interest rate and guarantee the principal at maturity.
Of course, you have to keep them for the long term, which the really rich can afford to do.
Can you?
If not, you may sell the bond at a loss that negates the interest you were paid.
So you're stuck with safe U.S. short-term notes which mature at par and pay the promised (usually much lower) interest rate.
Not very exciting.
And if inflation pops your interest rate may give you breakeven or less.
Well, that's tough unless you had the cojones to buy one of the most volatile commodities in existence: gold.
This is a truly ferocious trap that has ruined many.
The big guns say don't speculate with money you can't afford to lose.
Hey, thanks.
That fits about .001 percent of the investing population.
Read Easterling for the historical big picture.
And it ain't a pretty picture.
It's all about volatility and volatility is a killer.
And so the moral of the story may be to be very careful with your investment decisions.
Err on the side of caution.
The first consideration of the physician is Do No Harm.
The first consideration of the financial investor is Lose Not Thy Wad.
Of couse there is the notion that markets investing is really just another excuse to excerise the gambling urge for people who consider casinos crass.
If that's you, may luck truly be with you.
This book brings together, pratical budget concerns with fashion, which are often in two totally different universes.
Not worlds, universes.
In the fashionista there is everything from how to get wine out of a shirt to when to know if you should splurge on a coat.
In the worlds of increase American debt, this book should be on everyshelf in America!
It is light portable and she is extremely funny!
Two thumbs up
If you don't know what you are doing then you need to get this book.
If you think you know what you are doing, then you definitely need this book because you probably have no clue.
Contrary to what one reviewer states, this text does provide a good balance between application and theoretical example.
I use this book all of the time as a graduate student.
It is a wonderful reference.
If you are studying econometrics, then this is the first book you should buy.
It was Mark Twain who popularized the aphorism of Benjamin Disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.
I kept hearing all these marvelous things about FREAKONOMICS, a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, so when I ran across it at 25% off, I did a stupid freakin' thing and bought it.
I thought, What the freak, I've got a pretty inquisitive mind and I'm open to seeing things differently, to discovering new viewpoints.
The doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times.
When all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is, I'm immediately going to be freakin' suspicious.
Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover, "Prepare to be dazzled."
Well, evidently Ol' Malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than I am.
(I won't even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the book's dust jacket because I don't want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover.
Or in this case, a writer by his physiognomy.
So I won't mention that.)
If you're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver's home, then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS.
If I tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts, thinking that it is cutting costs, is probably increasing its overhead, and this fact astounds you - if you must ask "But how?"
- then yes, buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled.
Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers (when its conclusions can be trusted) is just what we used to call "common sense."
But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent, brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS, and AMERICAN IDOLS, and LOST knuckleheads, good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead (when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands, that is).
I dove into FREAKONOMICS hoping to find my purchase worthwhile.
I got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized: everything would require second-guessing and verifying.
On that page, Smug Mug tells us (based on a single report by the Institute Of Medicine) that "drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health."
Fortunately, I read YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER by Doctor F. Batmanghelidj over a decade ago so I already knew what a bunch of bunk that was.
In chapter 4, Smug Mug "proves" that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate.
This represents the centerpiece of his book, both literally and ideologically.
The first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s.
On page 92, the author acknowledges that the police in Atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 Olympics.
Well, would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted?
True, being honest might be means to an increased budget, but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control.
And surely the Chamber Of Commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception.
Let me ask, do YOU actually feel you're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s?
That's funny, me neither.
There's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported, and recently, an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now.
In dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime (if this claim is a verity), Dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10% of the drop.
Having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian, it's funny that I find myself even contending with the stats Smug Mug uses that actually WORK AGAINST his theory: I believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10% - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly.
And Dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws "simply don't bring down crime."
(Be sure to read the utterly fascinating book, GUNFIGHTERS, HIGHWAYMEN pppppppppp VIGILANTES by Roger D. McGrath, for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint!)
In dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion, I didn't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s, and I wonder if that might have some statistical bearing.
Ya think?
Yes, I think Smug Mug is selective.
He calls some abortions a "crude and drastic sort of insurance policy."
Not "immoral."
Not "sinful."
But then I didn't expect Smug Mug to call a sin a sin.
And even if Levitt and Dubner's hypothesis is correct, that abortions have lowered crime, the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person, but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered.
So why are we even discussing this?
I'll tell you why: because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus, and now they're pulling out all the stops, trying to "statistically" convince the masses that they're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing.
I find this repulsive!
(And there are studies indicating that those missing people have, and will continue to have, a negative economic impact on society.)
I won't even go into chapter 5, What Makes A Perfect Parent?
Suffice to say that as usual (surprise!
surprise!)
all the statistics Dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue.
Funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs.
Just know that if you're a working mother, you haven't cheated your child in the least, but if you're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order, you are "unenlightened."
If your kid is watching lots of TV, it isn't turning the "child's brain to mush."
(No word on whether or not it's turning his/her morals to mush though.)
And the studies (that we are called to pay attention to) show "that a child's character wasn't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care, whether he had one parent or two, whether his mother worked or didn't, whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each."
(I've often wondered what might have happened to me if my Mom, who was home most of the time, hadn't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day, year after year, while I was growing up in the `60s and `70s.)
I've given FREAKONOMICS two stars because I did find the section on the naming of children very interesting, as well as the story of Stetson Kennedy's fight against the "three Ks."
But if you're smarter than I am, you'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it.
Economically speaking, that's just "common cents."
A wonderful story of how even our smallest action can have great consequences that we can't even understand.
A long book with fantastic memorable characters.
My favorite of these characters were the two brothers who were fixated on Serial killers and natural disasters.
This is the only way they know how to cope with the outside world.
Overall-You will certainly get your money's worth.
Enjoy this one.
I agree completely with the Becksted review (I also noted that it was helpful, but I meant it would have been helpful had I read it before I bought the CD).
This refers to the CD version.
I did listen all the way to the end, I kept thinking there was going to be something, but continued to be disappointed.
I found the analogizes to be strained beyond usefulness (evaluating someone's integrity by the size and shape of the wake they create... are their people waterskiing on it?)
It seems to be politically incorrect to come out in opposition to "integrity" in this day and age, but frankly this book didn't help me much.
This is the sort of book I have been looking for a long time.
I've read other books on the Middle East which purport to have a similar focus, but which are instead incomplete, notably "Sowing the Wind".
This book, by contrast, maintains the focus rather carefully and provides a concise history of the whole region.
It looks as if the book was written as a textbook for (I would presume) grad students studying the subject, but really any intelligent person can pick it up and learn a great deal.
An issue with a book like this is the tone of the work, how well the author writes.
Kamrava isn't the second coming of Hemingway, but he's not too bad, either.
The book is divided into two portions: first, a historical section that gives you an overview of the region's history, and second a topical section that looks at various issues that impact the region currently.
The first section is very readable, the second less so (who actually enjoys reading about economics?).
The author, however, does a good job (for the most part) of not sounding like a university professor telling you about something, though he does occasionally use words that are obscure, especially in terms of sub-regions of the Mid East.
I still enjoyed this book, thought I got a lot out of it, and would recommend it.
The author seems to be a hair more optimistic about the prospects for peace and prosperity in the region than I am, but he makes a good case for his point of view, and the result is interesting
Yes, it's cliche.
Yes, the plot is lifted directly from Star Wars.
Yes, there are obvious references to Anne McCaffrey, Tolkien and other fantasy writers.
But who cares?
Eragon is, above all else, an enjoyable read.
Despite underlying flaws in the writing, Paolini effectively tells a rewarding good-versus-evil story in a clearly-defined world, with a well-thought-out magic system and a realism Tolkien could never muster.
Sure, Eragon has its critics (mostly aspiring writers that have not enjoyed Paolini's success), but if you can ignore their blustering and simply take the book at face value, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Although not as epic or impressive as some of the older fantasy works, Eragon is nonetheless, a great read
I handsold so many copies of this book that my local bookstore accused me of emptying out the warehouse so they couldn't order any more.
Reid strives for a journalistic impartiality here but he is so excited by the current evolution of political life in Europe that he carries you along.
I especially love the story of little Portugal, which has unilaterally decided that drugs are no longer a criminal matter but a medical one.
The US could learn from that example, and from many other European examples in this book.
When you read the story about GE and Honeywell, you'll realize we're going to have to, because they're going to teach us whether we want to learn or not
Mrs. Kent's story applies to each of in the hard places of life.
We all have an "Isaac" - the person or thing closest to our hearts, our future hopes and dreams - that must be layed down.
In telling her story, Mrs. Kent illustrates the difficulty of this, yet demonstrates that it can be done.
She doesn't gloss over the pain, yet doesn't leave us there, either.
She shows us there is hope
I bought this book on a friend's recommendation.
If I had been in a book store and could have read a page or two I would have known immediately it was not the type of book I would read.
I'm sure it's wonderful for those who like it.
I passed it on to a friend
This book is off the hook.
Oh!
my God this book will have you looking at your "so-called" straight man in a whole new light
To put this review into perspective for you, it is written by a serious student of cooking that has been actively studying food on their own for 25 years.
I have been focusing on Italian food for the last 10 years.
My favorite cookbook is "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute of America.
If you are a serious home cook you will love this book.
The photography in this book is nice and the food styling is beautiful.
If you love to entertain and/or you want the meals you serve your family and friends to be gorgeous you will get so many ideas reading this book.
The directions for the recipes are very thorough and well written.
I believe that a serious beginner could follow these recipes without a problem.
I have tried many of the recipes in this book all to rave reviews.
I particularly enjoyed the chapter on foams.
The "cream whippers" are expensive, but they are extremely fun to use.
This book does not need to be used just for small bites.
It is as simple as just making fewer portions from the same recipe.
This book is highly recommended for anyone that is serious about cooking.
It's been a while since I've read one of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, but a sudden need for light reading found Ten Big Ones at the book store.
Plum's biggest worries tend to be about whether she is lusting after Joe Morelli or Ranger, how to get the latest bond jumper down to the police station, and how she is going to replace whatever vehicle just got destroyed.
Definitely light fare, even if her current problem is how to avoid death identifying the thief in a grocery store heist and then turning the local gang leader into a careening pinball in traffic.
He not only wants Stephanie dead, but he also wants her end to be spectacular.
Stephanie's response is to break up with her steady boyfriend, Joe Morelli, again, gorge on jelly donuts, and go into hiding at one of Ranger's lairs.
Of course, this doesn't work as well as it should because even Ranger's soap is too sexy for words.
And Stephanie, glutton for punishment that she is, she has to go out and make sure everyone knows that she is trying to keep a low profile.
So, you see, this is standard Stephanie Plum fare - lighthearted mayhem and a heroine who is half macho and half wuss, usually with bad timing.
My issue with Evanovich's books isn't with any particular one, but with what happens if you read too many at one time.
Stephanie's biggest problem is herself - a decided lack of common sense.
Which is what you would expect from someone who works as a bounty hunter, but leaves her gun in the cookie jar.
In four hundred pages this is funny, but if you've been reading a lot in a row, the steady diet of vaudeville sight gags is d?j? vu all over again.
After a break of a year or so this goes away and I found Ten Big Ones a pleasure to read.
It introduces a whole ne order of plot complication and one of the more remarkable bus drivers in literary history.
By all means, if you need a break from the weight of the world, take the time to read this.
One of the most interesting books I've ever read!
I could not put this one down.
If all economics books were written this well, everyone would want to be an economist!
The author has a unique perspective on the analysis of data that is very compelling.
He will make you question every "fact" you've ever heard and observe the world around you from a different angle
I don't know if I wold be willing to leave bags of blood at the bookstore, like the previous reviewer suggested, but it's a great book.
Everyone should read it
hercule poirot is up again to a very baffling mystery...this mystery is about one family that facing a crisis after one of the memeber dies...and in this family case,christie once again using her expertise (ie mystery surrounding the family) in manipulating her imagination according to the right situation...and i can assure you that you will thoroughly satisfy after you read this book..
Cover Blurb: When undercover work requires working under the covers, danger is an uninvited bedfellow... Erin McKenzie, a newly promoted homicide detective, lands the assignment of her career when she is chosen to investigate Elizabeth Adams, the number one suspect in a slew of serial murders.
Adams, elusive and devastatingly beautiful, is not only an accomplished seductress but also a lesbian.
* * * I have just finished reading this book after struggling with it for two months and, quite frankly, it is probably the worst book I have ever taken the time to finish.
The only reason I prevailed to the bitter end was I wanted to see if it truly was as bad to the last page as it was from the first--and let me tell you, it was.
Not only was this slow-paced, stilted, plodding excuse for suspence peppered with paper-thin characters who all sounded vaguely familiar, but two of the three main protagonists are thinly disguised Xeroxes of two beloved TV characters, minus the breast-plate, sword and loin-cloth skirt.
I leave you to work out who I'm refering too.
This book desperately struggles with flat, stilted language that has neither voice nor colour, giving the descriptions of place and people about as much life as a body on the morgue slab awaiting autopsy.
Add to that is the fact that at least 50-60 pages could easily have been cut from the length by a good Editor, thereby maybe adding a smidgen of tension to the over-worked plotline.
However, it is the three main protagonists who irritated me the most, the Author seemingly unable to decide on personality traits and character, which vacillate in a jarring way.
I was left totally unsympathetic to any of them and the situations/circumstances they found themselves in.
A very unsatisfying read
Like pretty much anything in which Neil's involved, this a fine and useful work.
The reviews of Teddy Millon's Axis II taxonomic extensions are worth most of the considerable price of admission here all by themselves.
But after 30 years in the field, I'll warn any newcomers that getting any too rigid with treatment plan rollouts will make you as nuts at the people you're treating.
As -guidelines- with notions about starting points and signposts along the way, however, these are very useful.
Neil's six-step Treatment Outline seems a bit oddly ordered, and I wasn't able to find a rationale for determining diagnosis in the final step (when you have to lay one on the client's payment guarantor at the outset).
But otherwise, the six steps are another handy construction among several now available.
If you're fairly new in the field, this will be a real handy reference, but don't stake the clients' lives (or your own serenity) on this when they start to go refractive.
Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELL and THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MAN STANDING did little for me .
.
.
add SPLIT SECOND, which I just heard, to that latter list .
.
.
it was a disappointing mystery thriller about two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together to solve two campaign-trail crimes .
.
.
I cared little about any of the characters, and there were far too many subplots floating around for my taste .
.
.
the ending also didn't do much for me, as it brought too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion .
.
.
lastly, I did not particularly "buy" the man behind the crimes; he just wasn't all that believable.
Wow..What lies.
I NEVER hear any kind of news channel favor the left...NEVER.
The media, especially FOX News, has a right wing bias..its 100% FACT, proven beyond any reasonable doubt.
The republican right wing NUT JOB Wackos INVENTED the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage, and its simply not true.
Republicans are the worst thing that could ever happen to this country, all they know how to do is lie, cheat, steal, and profit off of the suffering of others.
Oh yeah, and these religious wing nuts are delusional bigots who think some guy waved a magic wand and invented the universe.
Give me a break.
This book is 100% lies.
I actually burned the book after I read it...(Notice the lack of credible sources).
Good job republicans...Continue to make up news...the people are catching on!
I am a Nevada Barr fan and was unfortunately disappointed with "High Country."
The story takes place in a restaurant (boring).
The characters were dull and I kept getting them confused.
Anna's constant thinking of how old she feels is tiresome.
I also missed Anna's sister, Molly, who is only mentioned a few times in the book.
Sorry, but I really can't recommend this book as a good read.
If you want to get a feel for a real Anna Pigeon adventure, pick up "Track of the Cat" or "Liberty Falling.
Liz Perle does a really nice job in "Money, A Memoir" of weaving statistics, professional studies, and other people's experiences with her own personal experience and insight.
While many parts of her book sound familiar (e.g., women shopping when they're in a slump) it does look below the surface at some of the root causes of our unhealthy relationship with money and why we differ vastly from men in that regard.
The other thing I appreciated about the book was that Perle doesn't claim to have all the answers, and explains how she was able to find a happy medium in her relationship with money, which to me sounded like something I could attempt and achieve.
Thanks, Liz for a very important memoir that women of all ages should read
This book has a bad habit of being weak and juvenille.
Very weak and ordinary.
G
Jesse Stone is sort of Spenser's alter ego.
He's younger, and Spenser's never had a drinking problem, but other than that, they're pretty much the same character, except Stone's about thirty years younger.
Robert B. Parker has been writing detective novels for a very long time now: this is the fourth Stone novel, there are 31 Spenser novels, three featuring his third character, Sunny Randall, and nine books that aren't part of a series, some of them non-fiction.
That's 47 books, for those who aren't keeping up with the math.
Obviously, by now Parker knows what he's doing.
He seems able to write one of these every six months or so: he alternates between Randall, Spenser, and Stone with ease, and just floats along.
In this outing, Stone's faced with a real problem.
Paradise (the town he's Chief of Police in) has been hit by a rash of killings, and it's soon apparent that they're the work of a serial killer, or killers.
Stone has no way of tracking the killer at first, and the killers seem able to strike with impunity and kill whoever they wish.
Meanwhile, there's also a scared girl at the local high school, the victim of a gang rape and some threats afterwards.
Stone has to resolve things, and control the situation so that the girl doesn't get hurt.
And of course there's his personal life, which has been a problem for him since the series started with Night Passage.
His ex-wife is a manipulative sociopath, interested in only herself and how she can control him, near as I can tell.
In this installment, she attempts to manipulate him more than she should, and things take some interesting turns.
I enjoyed this book a great deal, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for some light reading
Just a reminder that this guy cheated on his wife around the same time Clinton was being pounded for his indiscretions.
Sean Hannity, early in his book "Let Freedom Ring" reminded us of how Bill Clinton tainted the office of the presidency and then not two paragraphs later noted how Morris was a good friend of his (Hannity's) and then led into negative opinions on Morris of Clinton.
Didn't bother to mention anything about Morris doing the exact same thing- and this little worm woulda lied with his palm on the Ark of the Covenant so don't give me (...) about the lame@ss lying under oath Republican punk.
(...) hyprocrite!
I am a huge fan of Kathy Reichs' novels and of the TV Series, Bones.
However, this book was quite a disappointment to me.
I did not care for the way the author wrote dialogue -- Brennan's dialog is not that simplimatic on the TV program, and she certainly would never say, "Where at!?"
The author way overused the joke where Brennan did not "know what that means."
All I could think of was how much better this novel would have been if written by Reichs herself.
I started to jot down the holes in the story but quit after a while
Using this book and CD-ROM depends upon being able to download the customized settings, so that the reader's PhotoShop, for example, behaves the same way as the author's PhotoShop.
However, my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the CD-ROM.
Furthermore, this author doesn't start at a "dummies" level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons, so I had trouble following along.
Overall, this wasn't much help for me in my quest to learn PhotoShop from a baseline of complete ignorance
Part geology, part biography, part history of Scotland, this excellent book is a tribute to James Hutton, the originator of modern geology.
Starting with the status of geology in the eighteenth century and the use of the Bible as the basis for estimating the age of the earth, the author weaves the intriguing story of James Hutton and how he came about discovering signs of the earth's true antiquity.
The political situation in eighteenth century Scotland is well described and illustrates the times in which Hutton lived.
But the book goes further in that the evolution of geology after Hutton's death is also discussed, ending with modern estimates of the age of the earth and a brief description of the methods used to produce them.
This is a very well-written and exciting book that should appeal to a wide audience
Unfortunately, instead of an thorough analysis of the genesis, justifications, and problems with overarching property rights, DeLong acts as a mouthpiece for other property rights activists.
DeLong covers some of the same ground as Congressman Richard Pombo in his 1996 This Land Is Our Land, simply emphasizing anomalous examples instead of practicable solutions.
DeLong's denial of the externalities resulting from uninhibited development leave his analysis unbalanced and ill-founded.
DeLong's politics overcome his analysis.
This book is similar to his condemnation of industry for their recognition to the denial of carbon dioxide emissions.
(...) His political agenda overwhelm his rational
The authors map out clear, effective and proven strategies for rewarding parenting in this excellent well-written guide.
An imaginative approach was called for when my 16 year old boy Jonathan threatened to barricade himself in his bedroom using just twigs, leaves, and his own spittle and dung, and this guide provided just that.
There's nothing wrong with setting parameters, the authors say, just as long as that are not arbitrary or capricious and they are clearly articulated - and for crying out loud why should he be allowed to act like a nesting African Hornbill under my roof
Investment Biker: 1-1/2 stars, just barely escapes the lowest possible rating.
This is a book about what a Tom Wolfe-style Master of the Universe does on holiday.
It's nearly impossible to have an "adventure" when you are carrying 10(!)
platinum credit cards.
He got cold and wet a few times, worried about finding gas, didn't always have hotel rooms up to his standards, and had delays at some borders, yawn.
The adventure must have been resisting the urge to buy an airline ticket back to New York using one of his many Visa cards.
I rode a bicycle around the world for 19 months at about the same time Mr. Rogers was having his "adventure."
I am stunned that he perceived so little in his long travels.
I don't know how someone could travel in foreign countries that extensively and end up completely unchanged by the experience.
However, this fits perfectly with his huge arrogance, which is truly the theme of the book.
He already knows it all and will tell you all about it.
Which makes one wonder: why did he bother to leave NY City in the first place?
I guess it was a good opportunity to pose with and boink the attractive and young (naive and pliable?
-- certainly lubricious) daughter of one of his clients.
And a good opportunity to pump himself up by feeling superior to all those "brown faces" he's driving through.
The arrogance, the arrogance!
Typical privileged, right-wing know-it-all.
I'd like to see him try to survive in the Peruvian highlands without all his money and fancy equipment.
This is not a travel book: Mr. Rogers uses his trip as a way to sell a long economic rant.
You can save yourself a lot of time by just reading his final chapter, "Afterword."
I will summarize his position: governments are bad; smart, rich guys like me are good (remember October 1929?).
Many of his predictions are laughably wrong.
He advocated selling the US economy short in 1993.
Look at the US stock market performance from 1993 through 2000 ... Gosh!
Idiot!
Some reviews are touting his prescience on markets.
Hello?
How about his predictions on the biggest economy in the world?
Mr. Rogers' writing is very poor and it's loaded with cliche's.
He and Tabitha are always zooming on "powerful steeds" into "gorgeous scenery", or "steep, craggy mountains" into "glitzy, glamorous hotspots" or "delightful, cozy hostels", or across "hot, empty, flat deserts" into "dumps" that are not up to American standards.
He'll "describe" one of the greatest mountain chains on earth, the Andes, as "the top of the world" (p. 315) for five short sentences and then move on to more important matters like further adventures with border guards and investing.
Great writing?
Rubbish!
I think he used a computer program to come up with his "descriptions" of the places he went.
Mr. Rogers is woefully ignorant about the places he goes - and he doesn't learn anything along the way.
He views the world exclusively through the keyhole of economics.
Most of the "interesting facts" he mentions about theses places are just wrong.
One indicative example: He describes the Moreno Glacier in Argentina as, "one of the few in the world still moving."
(p. 294) I found myself laughing out loud many times at his "facts" and descriptions.
If you want to understand the distribution of goods in the world, read "Guns, Germs, and Steel," by Jared Diamond.
If you want to read about a real motorcycle trip, read Ted Simon's "Jupiter's Travels," or Robert Fulton's, "One-Man Caravan."
For good travel books, try: "Seven Years in Tibet" (Harrer), "News from Tartary" (Fleming), "Arabian Sands" (Thesiger), "Gypsy Moth Circles the World" (Chichester), "Sailing Around the World" (Slocum), "Motoring With Mohammed" (Hanson), "Full Tilt" (Murphy), "A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush" (Newby), or "Eastern Approaches" (MacLean) "My Life with the Eskimo" (Stefansson), "Endurance" (Lansing).
I could go on and on.
"Investment Biker" is poorly-written drivel compared to all these and so many more.
"Investment Biker," a classic?
That's ridiculous.
From another review: "Greatest Book on Finance, Business, Travels Ever" That comment almost leaves me speechless.
Obviously written by someone who has read very few travel books indeed
I just finished reading The Handyman's Dream, By Nick Poff.
I was completely blown away!
This is a great book.
Its about 2 guys who meet one another in small town Indiana.
After the first chapter you will want to have these fellas over for dinner.
The story is very well written and has alot of innovative things in it that I havent seen in any other gay novels.
I love the way the author integrates Music and songs into the story.
From the Character Norma ( ed's Mother)and her quirky comebacks to the wonderful Mrs. Penfield, the novel will have you laughing and will touch a place deep inside you that few books do.
This story also tells of the fears and struggles a gay couple had in the past, and one many still have today.
I love the fact that its very g rated and a good read for not only gay folks but also straight folks...Anyone who believes in the power of love.
I wish while growing up I would have had a book like this one to show me that there IS such a thing as good , healthy gay relationships.
I Highly recommend The Handyman's Dream.
I have been a fan of Larry Gonick`s work for years ever since I first stumbled onto his Cartoon Guide to Statistics.
He covers a subject the way it should be covered-historically.
Innovations in science and math have moved along together in a historical time line.
It was this historical approach that made Carl Sagan's Cosmos series one of the greatest innovations in the effort to popularize science.
I have long said that we teach science backward.
We still teach on a 19th Century model.
We start with biology, then chemistry, and finally physics.
Even when I was in high school, I wished that I could take physics before chemistry.
Before I was elected as a school board director, I was on our district's Gifted Advisory Council.
I made the suggestion that we teach physics before chemistry and, then, biology last.
I was immediately shot down by one of the other parents on the basis that sophomores do not have the math courses under their belts to tackle physics.
So why not teach the math along with the science?
Integrate it.
(No, that would make it too relevant.)
I felt vindicated when a friend of mine reported that she attended a lecture by a Nobel laureate making the same assertion that I had been making for years-we teach science backwards.
After all, the toughest course out there is biochemistry-at least that is what every med student I know has ever said.
And biochemistry is the new frontier for blockbuster innovations-nano-technology not being the least of these frontiers.
Gonick underscores my assertion about teaching physics first, because in this book on chemistry, he introduces quantum mechanics, which is normally taught as physics, on page 28.
Don't let he word "cartoon" in Larry Gonick`s books fool you into thinking that these are easy fluff surveys of the subjects involved.
He makes each subject accessible while being entertaining, but each book stands on its own as a complete basic survey course of the subject.
So when I needed to add about two dollars to my order to get free shipping, it took me about thirty seconds to find my book.
I went right to Larry Gonick
There is no measure how harmful and disastrous this "sermon" has been to all who have read or heard it.
The teaching of hell or everlasting damnation (eternal torment) is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of Christianity over 1800 years ago.
The first century church never believed in a "hell".
The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from pagan religions of the world.
"Hell" was embraced by the political/religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and "converting" effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as "orthodox" centuries after the resurrection of Christ.
Our English translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact, when it is actually fiction.
Mostly all English versions except the Concordant Literal New Testament and Young's Literal propagate this fallacy.
Do your homework.
Go to www dot what-the-hell-is-hell dot com and www dot bible-truths dot com and read up.
If you scoff then here is your challenge.
Do the research from a non-traditional, non-pagan perspective and you might find incredible things to praise God about.
Other HIGHLY recommended books are "The Inescapable Love of God" by Thomas Talbott (ISBN: 1581128312, not on Amazon, you must google it), "The Origin and History of the Doctrine of Endless Punishment" by Thomas Thayer, "The Bible Hell" by Dr. John Wesley Hanson.
Go to the sites given above and finally get a better view of what "hell" is and where it came from.
You will find answers to the many questions that arise from searching this out.
All those who scoff and stop up your ears and move on, to you I say that the real hell is the one that your doctrine creates in the minds and hearts of all who have been indoctrinated by it and your view of God that it creates.
THAT is hell indeed, and THAT is the ONLY hell that exists
I'm sorry, but I expect more out of a book.
Beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric.
After reading beautiful books such as Cold Mountain and Brideshead Revisited, to mention just two, I found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that I knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that wouldn't be worth the read.
At page four I was fed up with the author's style and slammed the book shut
If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception.
The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas.
The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever.
What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included.
It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!
); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.
McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore.
As a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, I can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever.
I got this book based on the glowing reviews I found here, and I'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it.
The most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle "An Integrated Approach to Security in the Organization."
The book not only lacks effective security integration techniques, it doesn't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half-hearted integration.
Don't buy this book if you do not have to for a class.
I did.
As with most textbooks, it is a ripoff.
Mankiw got a 1.4 million - MILLION - dollar advance for it.
Who do you think pays that.
What kinds of things does this text teach?
Well, it contends that unemployment insurance and labor unions cause unemployment, because people do not want to look for work when they can fall back on the governmnet.
This is the biggest load of hooey in the world.
I guess when you are a rich, tenured professor it is quaint to see those people lining up who just lost their jobs because business major read your book.
And minimum wage?
Kills off jobs.
Mr Makniw is now the chairman of the presidents council of economic advisors.
What a job he has done.
Worst jobs record since Hoover.
Of course, if the capitalists honchos had their way, everyone else would be working for $2.75 an hour.
Read this book, but go to the grocery store first.
On top of the $100-plus you pay for this book, punk down 75 cents for a box of salt.
You're gonna need every grain
Any beginner or intermediate learner, who wants to be enlightened on the basic mechanisms of both computer and its peripheral devices, would be laying a good foundation by starting with this book.
Without compromising its concise outlook, the coverage of this book is as comprehensive as it is illustrative.
Its updated chapters are well-appreciated, although that anyone who currently owns the seventh or even the sixth edition would not be missing much by sticking with either editions.
Despite being labelled "How Computers Work", the contents of this book are not limited to PCs.
They covered other related issues like: Networking, Multimedia, Printers, Software, and so on.
Detailed explanations, which are frequently complemented by high-resolution graphics are abundant.
This book literally takes its reader into the 'engine room' that keeps a computer running.
It is an impressive virtual tour on paper!
However, if you are an advanced learner, this book will be of little use to you.
In fact, there is hardly anything in it that any self-respecting advanced learner has not come across.
Likewise, Apple/Mac stalwarts need not invest in it.
Its focus is entirely on the PC: with no room for Mac.
All-in-all, the uniqueness of this book is plausible.
It is a welcomed advantage.
Every PC component, as well as peripherals, are laid bare.
It is a resourceful hand-holding tools for beginners: a worthy and dependable guide for any novice
I bought this off of the New York Public Library website.
What an utter waste of $40.
The book that comes with the software is somewhat helpful, but honestly there is no new information to anyone who has been collecting books for a while.
The worst part is the "software" that you are supposed to use to catalog your books.
First of all, it is difficult to install--this is always a sign of a inferior product: no product that was properly QA'd would be released in such condition.
Second of all, the product is just a fancy version of a spreadsheet.
I could literally use Excel or MS Access to catalog my books just as well as this software.
You actually have to input EVERY piece of data associated with a book.
There is no excuse for anyone with an Internet connection to have to manually input book data.
I state again: it is very surprising that the New York Public Library would include this product in their stores.
It is a major, major rip off and there are far superior cataloging products out there.
The product I finaly ended up using is one called Readerware (http://www.readerware.com/).
Readerware, for the same amount of money ($40), allows you to scan in the barcodes of your books--the software comes with its own CueCat scanner.
Then the software looks up the barcodes you entered, (using the Internet), and updates each barcode with all the available info on the book.
I scanned 800+ books in about 4-5 hours.
BTW, you can also use Readerware to scan in all of your DVDs and CDs, (you have to pay more to get the full version of Readware that supports books, DVDs, and CDs).
Of course, you don't have to take my recommendation to buy "Readerware", but please don't waste your money on "Your Home Library.
Oh, Spike in San Antonio.
It's so hard to believe that sexism exists, isn't it?
I'm not sure where your numbers come from, as your logic seems tenuous, at best, but according to that left-wing, liberal think tank known as the US Census Bureau, Rowe-Finkbeiner is right.
And it's getting worse.
The Census Bureau reported in August, based on the Current Population Survey, that women's real median earnings fell by $171, or 0.6 percent, from 2002 to 2003, while men's increased by $336, or 0.8 percent.
(The increase for men was not statistically significant, but the decrease for women was.)
The gender wage ratio thus fell to 75.5, compared with 76.6 in 2002.
In addition, a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released in October of 2003, controlling for changes in education and work experience over time, concludes that womens earnings have remained stagnant, relative to men's, for an even longer period--17 years--with a gap that cannot be explained by measurable differences in education and experience.
If you actually read The F-Word, you might find cited cases like this: Although women make up nearly 3/4 of Wal-Mart's workforce, men hold 90% of management positions--despite female employee's receiving better performance evaluations overall--and female employees are paid lower wages than male employees for the same jobs.
None of this is disputed by the corporation.
Why?
According to Wal-Mart, because men are there for a career, while women are working for pocket money.
I wish I could say your attitude was merely naive--but the truth is it's far more dangerous and insidious.
Thanks to Rowe-Finbeiner for telling it how it really is.
...Uldrich makes big bucks on the public speaking circuit discussing nanotechnology...I suspect this book was published for no other reason than to provide some "credentials" to support the speaking engagements...his most recent books published since this one have been one about George Marshall and another about Lewis and Clark -- real cutting edge technology there!...nope, don't buy it
the best book i read in the past year.
the truth hurts
With "Dead Watch", Sanford has delivered a political thriller that is fully worthy of mention alongside his popular police-procedural Prey series.
I share the Booklist reviewer's sentiment that Sandford has produced a D.C. intrigue reminiscent of Ross Thomas (a VERY good thing!).
My biggest beef with Dead Watch is the bland characterization of Jake Winter (though Sandford does do a good job of making Winter not be Lucas Davenport); nearly every other character has more personality-pizzazz.
Not to worry though, the Madison Bowe character and the breakneck speed of the story more than make up for that shortcoming.
If I'd been turning pages any faster, I'd have probably started a fire.
Talk about a warm, fuzzy, heart touching book, this is it.
Authors Allen pppppppppp Linda Anderson have touched on the very core of the existence of our beloved pet, the dog.
Taking accounts from numerous people they share with us stories of courage, love,loyalty, sacrifice and more that our four legged friends have bestowed on humans.
After each story we have a short meditation that enhances the read.
I am a dog lover so for me this just re-enforced their need in our world and helped me appreciate them more.
Are they indeed sent from our Maker as messengers of love?
I believe that may well be true.
If you love dogs, or even if you just want to understand their unique service to man; this book is for you.Written in a tender, honest, interesting and absorbing way; you will find it difficult to put this book down.
I recommend "Angel Dogs" highly.
Absolutely amazing insight!
Fascinating exploration into the physics of cooking, written in an engaging and detailed style.
Probably better for the scientist who cooks than for the cook who's into science, since the language is sometimes a little dense for the layperson.
Worth working through, though, if only for the gorgeous and elegant formula for figuring out how long to boil your eggs to get them EXACTLY right.
One caveat: the author is British, and recipes, measurements, and terms are geared for the British/European cook.
This means you'll find a complete explanation of sausage rolls and nothing about popcorn.
Just FYI
This story, set early in the pppppppppp quot;Known Space pppppppppp quot; period, is an important part of Larry Niven's future universe, full of his accustomed ingenuity in both the plots and the science.
The Protectors don't fit quite comfortably into the pppppppppp quot;Known Space pppppppppp quot; Universe, and have raised some problems later, for example in the famous pppppppppp quot;Man-Kzin Wars, pppppppppp quot; where the pppppppppp quot;Known Space pppppppppp quot; universe has been shared by other writers, including Poul Anderson, Jerry Pournelle, SM Stirling and Hal Colebatch, but the story is fine space opera and entertainment, and has a genuine sense of strangeness and wonder that all too often is lacking from contemporary SF
McCain et al write very well and I was impressed by his style.
The writing was not the only style with which I became familiar but the "style" of the man himself, John McCain.
This was a truthful, revealing account of a man of honor who is presently in an oft less-than-honorable profession.
We can only hope the remainder of his career echoes with laud that of his grandfather and father.
I believe this read is one to add to one's readings of autobiographies / biographies.
If you have been freezer cooking for awhile or are completely new to it you will enjoy this book because it has a different spin on freezer cooking than the classics.
I started with Once-a-Month-cooking and at the time it seemed revolutionary, but, though I loved it was a hard days work.
Then came Jill Bond and she was really talking bulk cooking!
When Deborah's first book came out I was excited because it fit in with my low-on-cash, short-on-time lifestyle.
This book is terrific because it provides a healthy alternative that is still pretty inexpensive.
The meals are more than casserole and there are lots of options that are more appealing for the warmer weather when you don't want to heat up the kitchen.
My favorites are the Cheese and Chicken Shells (not for everyone however) Chicken Enchiladas (taste great made with homemade whole-wheat tortilla, if you do that), Crab rice Chowder (gourmet), Bean Casserole and everyone LOVES Spaghetti Pie.
There are lots of good recipes in this book.
The drawbacks of this book is that after a few initial sessions I felt that I was more likely to choose some favorites than to use her already laid out sessions...that is okay, but, not as easy as using the shopping lists and plans.
Worth trying if you are serious about Freezer Cooking, but I would start with Frozen Assest first
I lived in a situation somewhat like that Richardson describes.
We watched VietNam from 1000 miles away, but the players were the same.
It was like living at the far edge of the Welsh Marches in the time of the Roman Empire.
Maybe if you haven't lived within a bureauocracy you won't understand, but everything he says is true
I purchased this book to find out about the publishing industry and more effectively market my book.
Without Mr. Kremer's Book I would have been clueless, however now I am well informed and continue to sell my book.
It has been picked up for a second edition by another publisher, which was my main goal.
( I self published as a quick way to get review copies out to the public and get the book rolling)I knew the world needed my book and I needed it releasedquick.
Mission accomplished.
I keep 001 ways close to my side and continuously consult it as I continue my publishing journey.
Highly recommended to anyone who wants to sell books and be successful and effective in the process
I have enjoyed all of David Gemmell's work but this one takes the prize.
It contains sorrow, great sacrifice, courage, honor, and some of the best battles every written.
It is easy to see the scenes and the people as you read, the characters are ones you will become attached to.
If you love fantasy that involves warfare and courage with people making the best of a bad situation and with no magic items to save the day, you will love this book
The book isn't good at all.
I'm sorry.
I loved I am Legend and seeing the list of books this guy has written which had been developed into classic horror movies (Hell House included) I was really excited to read this.
I have heard many complaints about the book from calling it "soft porn" to "sick soft porn" and then even being offended by the sacrilege present in the tale.
Sacrilege in a book called...Hell House is probably something you need to come to terms with before picking it up.
Attacking the author because of the content is really something that is not necessary.
I doubt these were Mathis' "sexual fantasies" in the book but more likely his idea of melding something pleasurable together with something terrifying.
It is an effective way to convey horror to a reader.
Similar to enacting horrible violence on children, or worse, babies in cinema (try watching the Hills Have Eyes without being on the edge of your seat while the villains in the movie dangle the fate of an infant in your face).
Mathis should not be condemned for content.
Here is what he did right.
He took the idea of a haunted house and brought it into the world of science.
Much like I am Legend used science to define its vampires, Hell House uses science to define hauntings and it is very well researched and believable within the framework of the story.
The bad parts may be more numerous.
His characterization is horrid.
There are four characters really and their personalities do not define them.
You will remember Barrett by his limp, Fishcer by his fear, Florence by her religious beliefs, and Edith...well because there is no one else.
They are paper thin and have no real motivations.
The pacing seems poor too.
A lot of moments are left on revelations in the point of view characters mind which that character has not fully processed because the chapter ends before they can relay it and all of its profound meaning to you, the reader.
As a matter of fact the revelations themselves, when all is said and done, are really pretty dull.
There is also a habit characters have, when going into great lengths of exposition that goes on for pages, to cup their hands around a coffee cup.
It seems too much like a commercial for me!
Anyway, the book hardly slows down for characterization or details and we get very few vivid descriptions in the book.
Sometimes I wanted to know what things looked like, I wanted imagery not just exposition for pages.
What was it about the atmosphere that, say Fischer found so scary?
We needed the scenes to be better developed.
By the end I was so tired of lines like: "God do you know what this means?"
"What?"
"I can't tell you now but it's freakin' awesome!"
That exchange is not in the book but you will find many similar moments throughout.
Just tell us already!
The fear should come through our attachment to the characters not the mystery of the house because the mystery of the house is kind of weak.
This book is not worth it, unfortunately.
I hate to say it because I Am Legend is really good (though it did suffer from some of the same things I pointed out above, though on a smaller level).
It's the classic "show don't tell" advice
Phyllis Chesler is a most unusual feminist.
She really doesn't fit in with the equity feminist crowd and is a complete dissenter from the female superiority, gender feminist crowd.
The one thing that makes her consistently worth reading is her passion for telling the truth.
This seems to be her most pervasive (and endearing) feature as an intellectual, and the trait was ubiquitously on display throughout her recent "Death of Feminism" release.
Here she tackles a verboten subject which is whether or not women are the unbridled source of goodness that many feminists assume them to be.
Numerous examples of misapplied and unprovoked indirect aggression are identified and elucidated in the text.
On the whole, it makes for compelling reading.
We find that women are regular human beings just like everyone else.
They have many of the same, yet subtlety different, characteristics as do men.
In these pages, Chesler illustrates the magnitude of inter-woman hostility as their strong social skills can often be applied in a negative manner.
Many mother-daughter conflicts are projected into adult situations.
Why feminists wouldn't have wanted this published seems rather silly to me.
We should regard women as they are and not as objects of fantasy.
Chesler never implies any inter-sex superiority or inferiority, she is content to describe what is, and it's great stuff indeed.
Ayn Rand's masterwork earns its reputation as a monumentally influential book.
It is at least as important today as it was when it was published in 1957.
Altas Shrugged lays out, in the form of a sprawling novel, Rand's philosophy, Objectivism.
It has been said in a couple of different surveys that the book is ranked by Americans as the second most influencial to them, trailing only the Bible.
Atlas Shrugged covers a lot of philosophical ground, but at its heart is a story that drives home the importance of the people who produce disproportionately in society; people who invent, design, build, manufacture, improve and manage.
She lays out the a story of a society that resents these people and their wealth despite the fact that they earned it and that they improved everyone's standard of living while they improved their own.
Mysteriously, society's producers start vanishing, one at a time until almost none are left.
The outcome and the explanation are fun reading while they make an important point.
Our society has been wealthy enough for long enough that it is way too easy to take that wealth for granted and forget where it comes from.
The decisions we make when we fail to keep in mind the source of the wealth do really have the power to make our standard of living go away.
Rand reminds us of this critical, but easily forgotten lesson in an eloquent way.
Read it and then tell ten friends to read it too.
More of us need to see this side of the story.
The fact that it's unpopular right now just makes it that much more fun
As always, Jeffrey's book is worth reading very much.
I have read the first version (edition), and I read this one again.
If you want to know lots of inside out about CLR, this is the one to read.
This is a must-read book before you go for a job interview, because you are expected to have read it by lots of interviewers.
Angus Konstam's HISTORY OF PIRATES uses works from the Mariners' Museum in Virginia to provide a powerful visual impact.
Piracy from ancient to modern times is surveyed in a series of maps, images, and discussions that cover specific events, regions, and pirates.
Plenty of historical and political background to the events place each in perspective and provide an excellent survey of mariner events of the times.
There are other pirate histories on the market - but none with the commitment to visuals of HISTORY OF PIRATES.
The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck.
I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them.
I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.
As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad.
The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense.
The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).
Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market.
An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.
The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.
James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware.
Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days.
London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end.
The author makes a good case for index mutual funds but there are too many digressions about the author's extracurricular activities.
Do you really want a pumpkin pie recipe in a book about mutual funds
Another incredible read from CJ Box.
I'm intrigued in the manner he sets up the future of Joe Pickett in each of his books.
I couldn't put this one down
Mark Twain called the Book of Mormon "chloroform in print" and he wasn't kidding.
It is by far the most boring read I have encountered (I could barely get through it).
I am a woman of faith - faith in God and faith in Christ and I don't know how anyone could believe this rubbish.
PLEASE, anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church.
Ask some hard questions (you will likely get a rehearsed answer, but it's worth a shot).
Joseph Smith was accused (and fined with a misdimeanor) of being a "glass looker" - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the Spanish.
He would use "magic stones" that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location.
So convenient that he later found "gold plates" and used what he called the "Urim and Thum" (which, by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the High Priests of Israel in biblical times) to translate these plates (he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat).
There are SO many myths that are told by members of the church "most men were SO distraught at the thought of polygamy", the age issue of Joseph translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith's actual role in polygamy (which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband... 11 of Josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him, having NEVER divorced the first husband - what's up with that???)..
etc.. and the list goes on and on...
I am not disputing that Mormons take care of their own... that they are often kind people who have good hearts, I think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that's great!
Just PLEASE do some homework first and don't just rely on the "power of prayer".
There is a reason that Utah is the [...] capital of the USA (I'm sure every one of those people "prayed" about that big business decision - it can OFTEN be mis-intrepreted).
Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.
It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.
It also just lacked credibility in many spots.
Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting.
Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating.
This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.
The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist.
He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's.
I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.
This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable
Mr. Bones is a very special dog, a dog who understands Ingloosh and almost speaks it.
A dog who is happy roaming about the country with his master, Willie G. Christmas.
If Willie is homeless, probably schizophrenic, certainly eccentric; if they rarely have enough to eat; if he doesn't always understand Willie's metaphysical ramblings--what does that matter between a dog and his best friend?
Alas, in the first chapter, Willie is coughing up blood, and Mr. Bones knows that Willie is going to die.
The entire story is told through the point of view of this remarkable dog.
Is it the story of a dog?
Or the story of Willie?
Or the story of life in America?
Or a story about love, alienation, betrayal and loss?
Well, it's all of these.
And what is Timbuktu?
For that, you will have to read the book.
I'm not going to tell you.
Author Paul Auster is a genius with language.
Somehow he draws you into this improbable story and makes it believable.
More than believable.
Compelling.
Does he really get inside the mind of a dog?
Who am I to say?
I can only say that for me he makes the mind of a dog as believable and understandable as any other mind.
Some reviewers expressed disappointment with this book, but I thought it was wonderful.
Just let it speak in its own voice and take it for what it is and you will love it.
I recommend Timbuktu highly.

Fun book
Leaving aside the fact that the author lied through his teeth (e.g.
he never actually studied Hwa Rang Do - he offered the Lee brothers some ink and they gave him a faked history) this stuff is about as inefficient as any stick fighting book I've ever seen.
Try Marinas' Panandata, Mark Wiley, the Presas brothers, Leo Giron or Ray Galang for stick stuff.
You'll be much better off

A comprehensive, entertaining and plainly written introduction to critical thinking.
It should be in every school and public library (preferably next to the biology books that have been stickered with pro-creationist caveats).
My only complaint is the title.
Perhaps it should have been called "The Critical Thinkers' Reference" so as not to confuse those poor mites who cannot differentiate between rational thought and Cartesian Skepticism.
Of course, if your world-view is not based on rational thinking and evidence, then the knowledge contained in this book may make you feel uncomfortable.
You may even feel threatened to the point that you negatively review it.
Guys - as Robert Park once said: "Alas, to wear the mantle of Galileo it is not enough that you be persecuted by an unkind establishment, you must also be right."
Please read this book (or even read the FAQ on Carroll's website) and learn how to reason.
Bishop presents an entertaining history of bees and beekeeping, and gives us an absolutely fascinting tour into the relationship between humans and bees, both ancient and modern.
What she misses are her science references: On page 142, Bishop recounts the removal of a stinger: "...he grabbed the whole sac, which simply squeezed in more venom."
This is not true.
It is an oft-repeated piece of conventional wisdom, but in 1996, entomologists at UC Riverside published an article in The Lancet (348:301-302), with the conclusion that rather than removal method, speed is of the essence.
Visscher and Vetter wrote of their conclusion: "The method of removal is irrelevant, but even slight delays in removal caused by concerns over performing it correctly (or getting out a knife blade or credit card) are likely to increase the dose of venom received.
The advice should be changed to simply emphasize that the sting should be removed, and as quickly as possible."
On page 276, Bishop writes about royal jelly "...worker bees secrete and feed exclusively to a select few fertilized eggs, one of which, on this special diet, will grow into a queen."
This is patently incorrect.
Royal jelly, as all beekeepers know, is fed to all the brood by nursery bees for the first 2-3 days of the brood's development.
After this time, most brood who are not destined to be queens will receive pollen as food, whereas queens are fed the jelly all their lives.
It is rather stunning that an author who keeps bees herself and obviouly spent considerable efforts in researching her book can make such a glaring error in bee knowledge.
This was quite a blow to me at this point in the book as I have enjoyed the book very much, and to run into such a blatantly uninformed statement from the author caused me major disappointment.
Otherwise, this is quite a good, absorbing read.
When I traveled in Japan with a friend, this was the book we brought with us.
Within a week we were at a foriegn language bookstore in Tokyo looking for a better one.
There are some things this guide does quite well -- it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country, and the advice to get a JR pass was invaluable.
However, the book has a very negative, immature view of Japan as a country and travel in general.
It seems to be written by bitter expatriates with a fascination with gaijin bars and the sex trade.
Did I pay $1200 for plane tickets to go drink with Americans?
The authors express a bias against culturally interesting sites, ancient and modern, that borders on the anti-intellectual.
The cultural notes are dated, inaccurate, and shallow.
After a while, we began to think, "If Lonely Planet doesn't recommend it, it's probably interesting."
The maps, as many have mentioned, are almost useless.
Ironically for a series which fetishizes getting off the beaten path, it's practically useless once you get out of the main tourist areas.
There are much better guides available.
This entry has sworn me off the LP series for life.
Before the Epiricist philosophers came along, it was generally accepted that there were certain things that humans merely knew facts to be true.
Basic philosophical concepts were reasoned to be true by a priori reasoning.
Thus, complex metaphysical ideas were formed by inductive logic, working off what was assumed to be true.
Then Hume came along and destroyed more than two thousand years of metaphysics.
Hume showed that everything we know can be broken down in to two categories: Relations of Ideas and Matters of Fact.
Relations of Ideas are things that a true by defintion.
2+2 will always equal 4, because that is how it is defined.
Try as we might, we can never successfully imagine 2+2 equalling 5.
So relations of facts do not really tell us anything about the natural world.
They are definitions we use to describe what is happening.
Matters of fact, on the other hand, are ideas we have that arise from our experience with the world, such as "The Sun will rise tomorrow morning."
Unlike with Relations of Ideas, Matters of Fact are not true my their defintition.
We can imagine successfully "The Sun will not rise tomorrow."
How, then, if we can imagine the supposed impossible, do we know anything to be truly impossible?
Hume creates the basis for philosophical skepticism in this enquiry.
He effectively show us that we can never know anything to be absolutely true.
It wasn't until Kant's Critique of Pure Reason that philosophy recovered from the blow of Hume's metaphysics.
This is a seminal text in the history of metaphysical and epistimilogical work and should be read by any and all philosophers
This book provides nothing new.
It is centered on the whole idea of setting up your retirement accounts so they automatically deduct from your paycheck.
If you have 401k, duh, it does that automatically...anyway, boring.
It also says to save money, don't use credit cards, pay yourself, blah, blah, blah.
Oh yeh, if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years...zzzz.
Ok, it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks.
One idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account.
Upon reading this, I decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal .2% I've been earning on my saving account.
And not realizing the latest craze started by ING, all the other banks offer an "online savings" account which offers 5% compare to the dismal .2%.
I immediately switched!
Other than this part of the book, it was boring
This is a moderately well-spun book about the "No Spin Zone."
Should be called the "Know Spin Zone" since really nothing in it is objective.
O'Reilly is a case-study in the typesubjective journalism that is prevalent in the media these days and the book shows this.
In other words it's a must read for everyone with the ability to see through it.
If you can't see through O'Reilly's bias then this book is poison
This is the story of another tragic episode involving a Native American tribe.
That this probably happened under other circumstances, and happened to more than the Arapaho tribe, cannot be doubted.
This is another in a series that has given us insight into tribal life and continues to leave us wanting more.
The characters are strong, believable, and you want the best for all of them.
The underlying plot--selling tribal babies and telling their parents they died--is heartbreaking.
The reunion of one such child with her father made me weep.
And Vicki's trial reconciliation with Ben gave me hope.
This is a great work, written with deep feeling
I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read.
I was dismayed with this book.
James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had.
One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him.
Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure.
Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty.
So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value?
It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic.
Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly.
Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that.
Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.
Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction.
A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result.
I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept.
Like a joke of some kind.
I'm not laughing.
You think you are getting something to help assist you in linking yourself with the beyond, but you are in all actuality getting something that reads more like something being explained that the author doesnt really believe instead.
I love Konstatinos' other books, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth
Does D.S.
know any other law schools besides, Harvard and Yale for her characters to have attended.
I am so tired of her books...this is it for me.
Its the usual suspects for her...rich and white....quite boring.
I used to love her and would read anything from her, but those days are over.....Maybe she should retire
When I thought there were not any more sex pppppppppp quot;techniques pppppppppp quot; I could learn from a book, this book just amazed me.Combined with stuff about how to make a lady feel special out of bed, this book can make you a better lover, husband or sex partner for sure.
When I first got diagnosed with ADD (as an adult) I believe the exact phrase "You mean I'm not lazy, crazy or stupid?"
went through my mind.
FINALLY, there was an explanation.
So when I heard about a book by that name, certainly I had to check it out.
Once I did though, I was sorely disappointed.
I have ADD, yes.
Nevertheless, I've still managed to get pretty far in life in spite of the "handycap" the authors of this book seem so eager to hide under.
It's been a while since I read it, but I have the distinct recollection of finding some new example of a "You can't succeed in the world because you are 'disabled'" mentality on every page.
You can't do this, you can't do that, you've failed and you will continue to fail - just accept it.
Excuse me?
I don't know about the authors of this book, but MY ADD makes me creative and intuitive and perceptive and just generally a genuinely unique and awesome person (egomania aside).
Where is this addressed?
Where are the helpful hints for harnessing THAT kind of potential?
If they're in there, I sure didn't see them.
All I found were new little tricks for combatting the "affliction" with which I am (oh so unfortunately) beset.
Using these tricks, I can hope against hope for some semblence of a "normal" life they say.
Thanks but no thanks.
I'm doing pretty well so far, and I refuse to feel like some sort of mental cripple.
If you, and the authors are happy considering yourself as something less than the rest of the world because of the way your mind works, feel free - this is the perfect book for you.
But you can count me out.
I purchased this book to read to my baby and it is just a sweet little tale about Mommies and their mischievious babies.
I can't wait until she is old enough to sit on my lap and really understand the story when I read it to her.
I highly recommend it
I found this book to contain some really sound advice and I would suggest it for anyone that was contemplating risking their money on the ponies
I've gotten through about 1/3 of the book and I'm highly amused.
The first 50 pages are muddled and rather pointless so far.
However, I've laughed my way through them.
One thing Eco has is a very sophisticated sense of humor.
If you enjoy a mental challenge and writing that's loaded with wit, I'd suggest picking up this book.
I never knew there were four kinds of people before: morons, fools, lunatics and cretins.
And I may just be a fool.
:)
This book is not as good as i thought it would be.
I hope i have better readings with Bryan Tracy's Advance selling
I read exactly half the book and stopped.
Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision.
As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back!
The book is silly and laughable.
The premise sounded great - but the book is bad.
Really bad
This was one of five books that I brought from Amazon.com and by far the worst of the lot.
This man has one idea about how the government really works.
Take it from me I have been with the IRS for five years
My pick for the finest book of 2005.
(Ok Smith's on beauty is up there too) We know from page one that we are in the hands of a master craftsmen!
Reading Ian McGawen is like watching a great pitching performance.
It might be slower paced than you'd like but God is it beautiful.
Fraught with elegance and grace "Saturday" is a great read and the work of a true literary giant.
I highly reccomend this book.
This book had a good message, and could have had a lasting impact on me.
But the plot was obscenely dull, and the middle of the book (Gene and Finny relationship) does not seem to fit in with the rest of the book.
Not recommended
I expected information about design, but this is just a self serving "I am good at what I do" book.
I am sure he is good but there is little or no information about how to actually desigh furniture.
No proportions, no instruction except make your mistakes on paper by sketching first.
A waste of good money.
The Winner and Absolute truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books.
Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books.
Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world
I enjoyed Robert Webber's book and have enjoyed hearing him speak as well.
At a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the "fate" of the church in America.
So much "commodification" has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be "ecclesia"?
Although I agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church (The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy - - - the church body which Webber received his doctorate from), my question is are we truly called to "change" the church in order to meet the people where they are at?
I agree with his assessments yet I question the reasonings behind doing it.
Do we begin to emphasize certain things to the demise of others, just because the culture would be more "prone" to come to the church?
Or does the church remain faithful to its calling despite the changing tides of culture?
Our self-centered culture always asks the question "What does this mean for me?
", and this has been a active question in the church for sometime.
I believe the question that we should be asking is how does God give meaning to me, or what do I mean to God?
Our focus needs to be off of ourselves and onto the Lord of the cosmos
A must for any afterlife library.The chapter entitled "Mothers Chapter" is worth the price of the book alone.
I know it will be hard to put this book down.
A delightful 2 day read
Have you ever been tempted to write pure nonsense?
Maybe on some rainy first day of April?
I once felt like writing: "I sure made a mistake when I told the Goddess Minerva that She couldn't square the circle.
In response, She drew a circle next to me, a truly beautiful and perfect circle.
And right in front of my panicky brown eyes, She turned pi into four!
Not just the circumference divided by the diameter, but the series expansion as an inverse tangent as well.
What would She do next, make me unwell by dropping the first letter from my first name?
i tried to apologize, but it was too late."
I was not the only one to dream of mangling pi.
In "Contact: A Novel," Carl Sagan went me one better when he had aliens send messages to each other at infinite speed by hiding them in a numerical representation of pi and then, you guessed it, changing pi everywhere!
Still, Alan Sokal went beyond even this, getting the following published in the journal "Social Text:" "In this way the infinite-dimensional invariance group erodes the distinction between the observer and the observed; the pi of Euclid and the G of Newton, formerly thought to be constant and universal, are now perceived in their ineluctable historicity; and the putative observer becomes fatally decentered, disconnected from any epistemic link to a spacetime point that can no longer be defined by geometry alone."
Sokal put this and many more whoppers into his hoax, which defended an equally absurd thesis: that "physical 'reality,' no less than social 'reality,' is at bottom a social and linguistic construct."
While this joke may not prove much, it does raise the issue of whether a few people in academia are misusing the vocabulary of science to create absurd statements in defense of an antirationalist point of view.
This book shows that they are.
The authors show that Jacques Lacan makes completely arbitrary analogies between topology and psychoanalysis.
We then see some of the same irrelevance and superficial use of topology in the early works of Julia Kristeva.
After an interlude in which Sokal and Bricmont seriously discuss the philosophy of science, there are more examples of academic nonsense.
The next victim is Luce Irigaray, who in what I agree is about as ridiculously antifeminist a statement as one could make says: "Science always displays certain choices, certain exclusions, and these are particularly determined by the sex of the scholars involved."
That's rich: objective truth is different depending on whether one is a Woman or a man!
I must admit that I half expected Irigaray to say that pi was different for Men and women.
After that, we see Bruno Latour's idea that Einstein's Theory of Relativity has implications for sociology.
The authors point out that this is manifest nonsense.
Were we to discover tomorrow that the ratio of the mass of a particle to its energy were slightly different from what relativity predicted, there would be a revolution in physics, but no need to alter theories of human behavior.
Later, we see Jean Baudrillard say, "It is a sign that the space of the event has become a hyperspace with multiple refractivity, and that the space of war has become definitively non-Euclidean."
And there are more, um, words, from Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and Paul Virilio.
Sokal and Bricmont conclude that all this inanity is a threat.
That either it will lead to even more irrationalism in academia or to an academic abandonment of social critique.
And I think it's worth warning us to avoid such a future.
But I also think we simply need social journals to get scientists to review (and reject) papers that use big scientific words instead of making coherent statements
oblomov is a guy who never quite manages to do anything.
he has great difficulties managing to do anything.
finally a friend manages to convince Oblomov that he must be active, otherwise he will never escape his laziness.
the psychology in the story is great.
the plot is always simple, perhaps too slowly progressing.
there is much humour in this book.
the characters are truly believable
In Faith in Nation, Anthony Marx delivers a spirited rebuttal of the "literary trope" (p 15) about a liberal, inclusive Western nationalism.
Instead, he argues that even the "truest" brand of Western nationalism-that of England and France-came to being only after brutal fratricide of massive scale.
His entire theory is based on a central position that nationalism developed much earlier than is popularly believed today.
This leads one to question why does he insist on such a position?
Has he made the case for it?
What happens to his theory if the position turns out to be wrong?
I will argue that the definition of the state, or the lack thereof, is key to answering all of the above questions.
Only by implicitly loosening the definition of the state, can Marx trace the genesis of Western nationalism back to as early as the 16th century, thus cementing the linkage between Western nationalism and religious violence.
However, the liberal adaptation of the concept of the state puts Marx's entire theory on shaky ground.
According to Marx, the state is the raison d'tat of nationalism: for nationalism to become a historical force, it "must ... refer to a state as an existing structure or potential object of engagement" (p 8).
Although he declares early and clearly what nationalism is (p 4), he never spells out his definition of a state.
In fact, what we would think of as a modern state today can hardly be found in 16th century Europe.
Only when the definition of a state is sufficiently loosened, can Marx backdate nationalism to the 16th century, when most of the political authorities at the time existed in the form of royal courts.
Only after he pushes back the genesis of nationalism, can Marx connect the religious violence of the 16th century to nationalism.
Only when the religious violence is viewed as part of the history of nation building, does it acquire significance in the nature of Western nationalism.
Otherwise, the St. Barthelme Day massacre or the burnings at Smithfield is just another "normal" religious upheavals in history, thus any association the massacre or the burnings may have with nation building would be purely coincidental-as Liah Greenfeld implied when Marx quoted her in saying, "Frenchness was disassociating itself from Catholicism."
To Anthony Marx, however, French nationalism and its French Catholic identity are not external to each other.
They are just different stages in the same dialectic process.
Therefore, real "Frenchness" is actually the public oblivion in France of the strange relationship between the church and the state1.
Yet all the grand reasoning depends on Marx's definition of the state.
After all, can we call the royal courts of the 16th century "states"?
Not only has Marx not given his readers a clear answer, some of his own writings seem to contradict each other.
For example, Marx mentions that the Treaty of Westphalia marks the beginning of the modern states (p 35).
But the French War of Religions and the reign of Mary Tudor-the very conflicts that are supposedly at the core of nation-state building-occurred almost a century earlier.
Even if we use the later date, 1648, as the beginning of the state system, one still has to be cautious to label all subsequent political authorities "states".
Regardless whether Louis XIV actually said "I am the state", the fact that monarchical authority is directly associated with an individual ruler makes it transient in nature (relative to institutionalized modern government), therefore it can hardly be designated the "object of engagement" for nationalist ideology.
Since Marx's concept of the state is on shaky ground, his entire theory appears highly questionable.
I would argue, however, there are two options that can salvage his arguments.
One is to weaken the link between nationalism and the state.
In other words, nationalism may develop independent of the state.
This observation may have a wider application outside of the context of Western history than inside of it.
The other option is to introduce a third element, such as political culture, that can bridge the violent past and state and nation building in later times.
For example, one accepts that the massive fratricide did happen earlier than the emergence of the nation-state.
Nevertheless, the bloodshed molded a new political culture, which manifested itself as a more inclusive nationalism when the nation-state took shape later.
If such an interpretation proves to be a more sensible reading of history than that of Marx, then Marx's criticism of Western nationalism can be easily appropriated to deconstruct the Western political culture-the liberal democracy-itself: that it has a ugly past but short memory.
However, is the world ready for such a "total recall"?
Colonial Fantasies is a powerfully argued and engaging dissection of colonial psychology, critiques of Orientalism that isolate gender and culture, and the Western feminist adoption of the rescue paradigm.
One of Yegenoglu's incisive arguments is that desire is the nexus in the process of colonial discourse that constitutes the Western subject as well as the possible resistance or interruption of this process.
As desire frames the relation between the subject and its other, Yegenoglu argues that the veil interrupts the relation.
As a barrier from which the other can see but avoid being seen, the veil is the site at which the colonialist desire is made manifest, but simultaneously displaced (62).
Her argumentation is lucid and compelling: for the colonial gaze, the veil is both the tantalizing object of desire (in the fantasy of unveiling) as well as the bte-noire, because it precludes the climax of the voyeuristic project.
The veil therefore frustrates the identity-forming process of the subject-object positioning in colonialist discourse; the subject cannot quite see the object, and its subjectivity thus remains in question.
Interestingly, this overtly phallocentric logic of identity forming through scopic penetration has been inherited by Western feminism.
As the veil has come to signify the backwardness of Islam and its inherent oppression of women, the visibility of the veil itself comes to embody difference.
In this dynamic, the identity of the liberated Western woman is constructed vis--vis the oppressed Muslim woman (102).
Since the status of Western women is contingent on the continued representation of Muslim women as oppressed, Yegenoglu reveals that the Western feminist establishment has a vested interest in the exceedingly patriarchal ideology of colonialism.
Yegenoglu then exposes the fallacy of assuming the unveiled woman to be normative; such universal constructions serve particular political ends in outmoded Enlightenment ideology.
She argues that unveiling and veiling are both cultural practices particular to certain cultures and historical moments (115).
This facilitates the deconstruction of the binary by unfixing the poles.
In sum, Yegenoglu's critical analysis of the colonial fantasy has produced a thorough tome sure to provoke further discussion among post-colonial theorists
to me .this book was definately NOT one of the best in the series.I admire the Kristina,but this book was slow and dull.It was practiacally all about the politics of sweden.very dull
I have to say I truly hated this book.
The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.
I've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky.
This time I found her usual friends and co-workers to be boring and self involved caricatures.
The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way.
The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere.
Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows.
This is my last Cromwell
Lost World Knopf Inc., 1995, Hardback 393 pp., $18.87 Michael Crichton ISBN 0-679-41946-2 What would you do if you were trapped on an island stuck with prehistoric dinosaurs that are ready to tear you to shreds?
A group of scientists are stuck on an island are about to be torn to shreds.
Ian Malcom and his three partners have gone to an island called Isla Sorna believing there are dinosaurs that are still on the island since the prehistoric time.
When they get to the island they figure out that the dinosaurs are not from the prehistoric time but from a cloning company called Ingen that cloned dinosaurs in Crichton's previous novel.
Lost World is a grabbing novel and will keep you reading for hours on end.
Crichton gives great descriptions of characters, places, and objects that will keep guessing if he was really on the island.
It makes you feel like you are a part of the story on the island or off.
Crichton has made novels that continue this novel and start this novel.
Jurassic park was Crichton's novel before this and Jurassic park III is the novel that continues this novel.
Lost World is exciting, adventurous, grabbing, and will always be a great novel.
I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes adventures and anyone who likes to feel like you're in the story.
Lost World is the best novel I have read and will be for quite a while.

This is a great book for anyone who wants a old world country feel to their home.
The illustrations are beautiful and the decorating advice is thoughtfully planned out
I fail to understand the complaints of two previous reviewers.
This beautiful glossy volume is an excellent compendium of previosly publisned Cook's Illustrated recipes.
In style and format it would make an excellent first choice for anyone wishing to be introduced to a selection of the best of the best recipes from America's Teet Kitchen (i. e. Cook's Illustrated) without the tediousness of having to wade through lengthy descriptions of how the recipes were arrived at.
The cooks at America's Test Kitchen test each recipe up to fifty!
times, often in several versions before arriving at the what they (and their taste testers) feel is the very best recipe.
No other cookbooks offer this degree of security to the home cook.
Chapters include: Starters and Salads, Soups and Stews, Vegetables and Side Dishes, Eggs and Breads, Pasta, Meat, Poultry, Seafood, and Desserts.
Throughout, are guides and charts to everything from grains to the best bakeware (also kitchen tested).
The recipes range from familiar comfort food (e. g. Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes, Glazed Meatloaf, and Deep-dish Apple Pie) to "show-off" company fare (e.g.
Baked Brie en Croute, Grill-roasted Chinese Style Duck, and Dark Chocolate Mousse).
If your looking for recipes that work everytime, do yourself a favor and purchase any Cook's Illustrated cookbook, including this one.
You won't be dissappointed.
"De-mystifying" a musical genre is a favorite practice of many historians, educators, and musicians, and has been overdone.
Unlike them, but not unlike a master performer, Palmer is able to strike a balance between technique, feeling, and authenticity: He is historically and musically adept without denying the Blues its inherent mystery and evocative nuance.
Palmer put his life into this work and it shows; he without a doubt "convinces".
I highly recommend his Deep Blues.
