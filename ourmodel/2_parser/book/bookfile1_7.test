Every page is an eye opener.
The author has done an excellent job revealing the side of Hillary that has so long been hidden.
I think America could do better by picking a different first woman president.
Someone with some morals and a love of our country.
She has neither.
It is an important "first" that should withstand the test of time.
Historians are going to have a field day writing all the trash these two are involved in.
Her mothering skills reveal a great deal about her character.
Her child was always placed last.
The only time Hillary showed any family unity was when it was necessary for the media to put her in a positive light.
How did these two gain so much wealth in such a short amount of time?
They did not even own property when "they" became president.
There are still a lot of questions to be answered, and many more books to be written about this family.
8 years of these two is quite enough.
Attention: Seasoned RealEstate investers don't waste your time purchasing this book.
Ideal for amatuer investors who want to add more value to their piece of real estate.
Wow!!!
This is a ton of great information from a 'been there, done that' Mom and Grandma.
The author shares wisdom, humor and stories all wrapped in grace... (I loved that I could read it and be inspired to be better, encouraged for the great things I AM doing, but not feel guilty about all the stuff I'm NOT doing.)
This is a celebration of the family.
I think I might make it my new standard baby shower gift!

Suzanne Brockmann is an unbelievable writer and her stories always draw me in.
The "mystery" portion of the story and the romance between Jane and Cosmo left a little to be desired.
I really didn't understand why Jane had to have her alternative personality as Mercedes and Cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened SEAL persona.
These particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to Jules and Robin, who clearly stole the show in this book.
As a matter of fact, of the different plots and stories going on in this book, Jules' was the best.
It was not only very well-written and sweet, but even as a hetrosexual female, I could identify with Jules and how he felt at times because what was happening to him, happens to all of us, whether you are in a gay or straight relationship.
I am really hoping that Jules either gets his own book, or has more appearances in future novels where he does find true happiness.
I do share Ms. Brockmann's opinion when it comes to differences in appearance, nationality, sexual orientation, etc.
and I really like how she includes this in her books.
As far as I'm concerned love is love, no matter what and it's portrayed beautifully here.
Please Ms. Brockmann, don't allow the naysayers to steer you away from this storyline, it's a very good one
It is now more than a month after I was supposed to receive this book and I have not gotten it yet, what the hell is going on
Don't be excited about this book's small size and light weight, the text needs more examples to support you while doing homework.
Breif chapter explantions caused me to nearly fail my class.
Was NOT a gret book, in fact many students complained to the Dean regarding this book.
Good luck
I agree with a previous reviewer who found fault with the way the story was told.
There is no excitement in describing the stages.
They are just wrapped up all of a sudden.
To me, it did not seem like the author did many interviews of his own.
It seems like he just watched the Tour de France and retold what he saw on the broadcast.
His supposed "back-stories" which should be really interesting, all seem like a recap of the mini segments during the Tour broadcast that let you know more about the participants.
There is just nothing that reaches out and grabs you, and makes you want to keep reading.
I finally quit it after the poor description of the day in the Pyrenees.
That is one of the most exciting stages of the race, and the narrative was so wooden
Not the most exciting book out there.
But if you like minor league baseball, this book's worth a quick read.
I originally bought this for my almost-2-year-old because I wanted him to have a new alphabet book with both upper and lower case letters shown (there are not many out there besides chicka chicka boom boom).
Instead it has become a favorite of my three year old who already knows her letters.
The reason: this book shows the letters and has beautiful illustrations of many items in one picture that begin with each letter.
Some things are easy to find in the picture and others are more challenging.
It is a beautiful book that provides "I spy" and "Where's Waldo" type challenges.
I highly recommend this book for the 1-5 crowd
I was expecting a substitute for the classic "Photoshop Channel Chops" by Monroy and friends.
It trivializes the subject with "How to unlock the hidden power of channels ... blah blah.
If you want a better understanding of channels be prepared to wade through a lot of fluff with this one.
Infomercial.
This book is a great thing to have for anyone involved in the world of theatre.
It does the hard work of picking out a crucial 16-bar piece of a song for you!
Great for auditions.
The book has selections from musicals (old and new, familiar and rare), as well as movies (even some Disney!).
There's one for every vocal part.
Granted, not every piece is exactly 16 bars.
Some go a bit over, but this is usually excusable due to proper phrasing.
It's well worth looking into for those who are just starting out.
It's also a way of introducing yourself to a variety of musicals
This book is great!
Assuming you already have a Ph.
D. in Political Science.
Otherwise this book is best reserved for drop quoting, or light reference.
The author shows bias towards the United States' form of Democracy, as is to be expected in such a book.
The simplistic nature makes the reader annoyed more than informed.
The childish approach is suited for school children, but not as appropriate as other books for real analysis
You probably know Joel Siegel from his enthusiastic movie reviews on Good Morning America.
But do you know the rest of the story?
Here's a chance to find out.
Mr. Siegel became a father for the first time at age 54, and his son, Dylan, was born on the day Mr. Siegel finished chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.
That cancer later spread to his lungs, and two more cancer surgeries and treatments followed.
Mr. Siegel's marriage did not last, but his love for Dylan did.
Realizing that his chances of living to see Dylan grow up are limited, Mr. Siegel decided to write down all of the wonderful things he wanted to share with Dylan over the next few decades .
.
.
but might not be able to.
The result is a touching memoir with a heart that will cause you to shed more than an occasional tear while appreciating Mr. Siegel's love for his son.
Mr. Siegel writes well, has had many interesting experiences, and retains his sense of wonder.
He is open about many of his faults (which have led to failed marriages), but remains cautiously optimistic .
.
.
and careful.
Dedicating the material to his son makes the memoir more personal and meaningful than almost any other memoir that I have read.
Anyone with an open heart would enjoy and benefit from this book.
If you are like me, you expected to mainly hear about the movies .
.
.
and you will.
But there's much more in the book about Mr. Siegel's family, Jewish heritage (there's even a Yiddish dictionary with hilarious definitions), illnesses, past marriages, and advice for Dylan.
The show business stories are almost all ones that I had not heard before, and will reward those who are primarily looking for this feature.
Although you might think these are only about the movies, he also was a music critic and got to know the Beatles in the early days.
I was particularly interested by Mr. Siegel's first-hand accounts of working for civil rights in the South, helping with Bobbie Kennedy's campaign, and how he helped his wife, Jane, with her fatal illness.
One of the thoughts you will have as you read this book is how you would write a parallel one for either your children or your grandchildren to play the same role in sharing knowledge and love across the generations.
I hope you will read this book and feel inspired to either transmit your own lessons in your own way .
.
.
or to create the book you want to share with your descendants.
In any case, keep a hanky handy!
as soon as people see breton's name on a book, they immediately feel indignation and privately exclaim, pppppppppp quot;the dictator of surrealism!
pppppppppp quot; what they don't seem to realize is that, despite being a flawed and somewhat ambivalent man, he probably had more passion in his pinky than they do in their entire body.
pppppppppp quot;nadja pppppppppp quot; is simply one more delightful proof of breton's genius and his infallible flair for the surreal, the mysterious, the mystical, and everything that is profoundly divergent.
in this tale of intrigue and obsession he travels the streets of paris with a ghostly, clearly insane young woman who calls herself nadja, which is the russian word for hope.
the most captivating parts of the novel are the bizarre and surreal conversations he has with her.
even though he found her incredibly fascinating and almost an ethereal enigma, things start to turn sour between them and breton grows bored with her.
at the end of the novel, nadja is put into an asylum after the police are called because of her incessant screaming and apparently incoherent behavior, some of which suggested that she was living in a world of hallucinations and irrational fears.
we do know that nadja was a real woman and not by means some fictitious creation of breton's, and we also know that she came to a somewhat unfortunate end.
it may be true that breton's behavior and attitude of indifference and deliberate ignorance about her truly wretched fate (she died of cancer, insane and completely alone) is indeed nothing to admire, but those who put too much emphasis on this admittedly accurate fact forget that while he may in a sense have betrayed her, he also made a truly admirable effort to make the world see nadja and those like her as no one has seen them before, and immortalized her in a book that is absolutely unforgettable and breathtakingly beautiful.
breton was a profoundly hopeful and truly revolutionary figure who exhorted humanity, even while the second world war raged and reaped it's devastating results universally on all of mankind, to recognize the miraculous and wondrous nature of our very existence, however 'absurd' or meaningless some felt it to be after the horrendous events of the twentieth century.
it is true that he occasionally goes over the top with his optimism, but his iron will and determination to fight 'miserabilism', the philosophical justification of human misery, at all costs can only call forth our admiration.
his exaltation of the imagination as the highest of human faculties and the sole organ of man that will allow him to attain felicity seems to be verified by direct, concrete experience of life.
as we grow older and we come to realize that sensual pleasure is a big part of life but essentially empty and hollow, our inner lives (hopefully) become more vivid and we end up spending more and more time there.
breton knows this and wants us to cultivate it to the highest degree possible.
don't be fooled by the 'anti breton' rhetoric and take a dismissive attitude toward him, because you'll be missing out on some of the most fascinating books (to my mind) ever written
In Plain Sight offers an exceedingly thin plot and thin characters, but it is still an enjoyable read owin entirely to author C. J.
Box's prowess at telling a story.
Saddlestring, Wyoming is enjoying the dawning of spring and, unsuprisingly for a police procedural, a possible murder.
Opal Scarlett, the grand and really mean old lady of Thunderhead Ranches, has disappeared and perhaps has been the victim of foul play.
Tom Wayman, an alcoholic fishing guide, is brought in as a suspect.
Opal, in violation of the law, charged Wayman and other boaters a fee for navigating the river that runs through her land.
She strung up razor wire across the river and the lazy sheriff thinks a drunken Wayman killed her when he tossed her into the river.
Frankly, there's not a lot of excitement here.
Joe Pickett, Wyoming Game Warden, is dealing with a problematic new boss and his 14 year old daughter, Sheridan.
Sheridan just happens to be the best friend of Jule Scarlett, daughter of Hank Scarlett, one of two brothers who might be heir to the big ranch.
Of course, they can't find a will and the two brothers are smashing each other with shovels when Joe arrives to drop off Julie.
Julie, it turns out, doesn't live with her father Hank.
No, she lives with Opal's eldest son, Arlen, on his "side" of the ranch.
There's a third brother, Wyatt, who is a bit on the weird side.
The very weird side.
Enter J. W. Keely, a good old boy, who is on the run from Mississippi where he has murdered a couple.
On his way to Wyoming to settle a personal vendetta against Joe Pickett, Keely murders a prisoner and then guns down a cowboy who did nothing more than get Keely angry.
Again, not much here.
Keely is not a convincing bad guy; more like a typed out description of a "bad" guy.
Under the name of Bill Monroe (which author Box reminds us several times is also the name of a famous country and western musician) goes to work for both of the Arlen brothers.
Golly gee: several nasty things happen at the Pickett household.
Oh my, the FBI keeps inquiring into the whereabouts of Nate Romanski (or something close to that spelling) who apparently figured largely in a previous novel.
All this produces tension in the Pickett household, high job stress, arguments with best friends.
Yawn.
Just not a lot of excitement here either.
Finally comes the climax.
Rain.
Thunder.
Floods.
Pickett's daughers kidnapped!
The truth comes out!
Box tries for a surprise ending, but it's kind of like a wet firecracker.
All that said, "In Plain Sight" is still an enjoyable, if not particularly suspenseful, read.
He has a strong writing style and does a nice job of weaving in a feel for Wyoming's people that is, in my opinion, stronger than the underlying story.
This is the sixth of the Joe Pickett novels.
I won't be going out of my way to read the older ones, but I will keep an eye out for anything new by Box.
He's definitely a comer even if he hasn't arrived.
Jerr
Having worked with VBScript for a little over four years I am by no means an expert; however, I feel that my experience does give me somewhat of an advanced applied knowledge of scripting.
I was pretty skeptical when I saw the word "Advanced" in the title, but this book laid all my concerns to rest in the early chapters.
The book begins with securing (including digital certs and policies) and encoding scripts as well as listing some nice techniques for implementing alternate credentials in WMI and ADSI.
For me personally, the real meat and potatoes of the book was the copious information pertaining to working with WSF and WSC files.
Don and Jeffrey take the time to detail the reasons behind XML functionality as well as it's application within the scripted files.
These guys clear up a lot of questions on these two subjects and how to package your scripts using these technologies.
They wrap up the package peice with explanations around HTA's and form controls in HTML scripts.
The book moves on to cover topics such as ADSI and ADO scripting, working with WshController and remote scripts, WMI and WQL classes and techniques, and different applicable real world examples.
All this information is then wrapped up with tidbits of using scripting editors to debug, sign, and package your scripts as well the wizards (WMI, ADSI, WSF, etc) and other tools available to make scripting easier.
I've obtained quite a few VBScript books over the years and this one is by far the only one dedicated to truly advanced VBScripting.
If you are new to scripting with VBScript, you might want to start with another book geared to learning the methods, properties, classes, etc of the syntax and the technologies it can use.
While this book does offer great explanations on advanced topics, you really need to have a solid background in scripting before you read it.
Thumbs up!
Highly recommended bang for the buck
This is going to be a short and sweet review because many others have commented on this book at length.
I want to contribute my two cents as a concise opinion based on its value as a powerful, engaging and thought provoking story.
This book packs the punch of great fiction.
It covers a broad territory from the ice age to the present with the drama of an epic.
You certainly don't need to be a history major, biologist or anthropologist to be moved by the story of civilization as told by the author.
Jared Diamond places a very strong emphasis on the role of geography, environment and other factors that relate back to nature in the rise of civilizations.
I think the major shortcoming of his work is that he doesn't give enough credit to social factors and their role is history.
If you don't know a lot about history or how physical factors in the environment contributed to the rise of agriculture, the need for armies, etc.
You will find this fascinating reading.
If you have a deep knowledge of these areas, anthropology and sociology, you may find the overly reductionistic stance annoying.
However, most likely you will enjoy the well-written story if you can keep in mind that it doesn't provide the full picture.
In short, this book magnificently illuminates Jared Diamond's specific areas of interest, while downplaying or neglecting others.
It provides a valuable piece of the truth and it does so in a very engaging and thoughtful manner.
........from reading Danielle Steel.
Here's the book: three bachelors meet three women.
They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.
BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.
I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.
Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.
My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.
THAT'S sad
Whilst the book may seem a little dated when it talks of tweed in the country and a matching silk jacket for your cocktail dress, it does contain a lot of useful information about putting together a great career wardrobe on a budget, which colours match, which accessories never date, and how to dress for evening functions of any nature.
I highly recommend it for anyone who thinks Jackie Kennedy was the epitome of chic, and who would like to know how to pull it off themselves
Much repetition and too little of artists neither western nor white...or male for that matter.
Though the sections are a lovely idea the same art is used in each.
A not terribly risky venture, this
A sad reminder that history is written by the victors.
I wonder how Americans would feel if Al Qaeda would write a similar book glorifying the 9-11 attacks.
Disgusting
I first read this extraordinary book in 1986, just two years after it was first published.
Picking it up again, I find it eerily applicable to our current situation.
There is a familiar old adage that teaches us that those who refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it.
THE MARCH OF FOLLY brings this message back to the forefront.
Barbara W. Tuchman eloquently discusses the bizarre propensity of governments throughout history to pursue policies contrary to their own interests.
Mind you, this is not a pacifist book but rather one that begs governments to beware of the reckless pursuit of policy that might prove to be dangerous.
And, yes, I admit right readily that hindsight is 20-20.
Beginning with the Trojans and their acceptance of the Trojan Horse to benighted Papal policy during the renaissance to Britain's stupidity during the American Revolution to questionable American policy during the Vietnam war, THE MARCH OF FOLLY invites the reader to consider the fact that as things change in historic chronology apparently nothing else does.
Given our current war policies, efforts and mistakes in Iraq, Tuchman's masterpiece is a very poignant read and we must confess, regardless of individual political leanings, that the potential for history to repeat itself yet again is considerable.
Who knows, there may yet be a sequel to this one appropriately titled THE MARCH CONTINUES.
THE HORSEMA
A work of art, Makine's use of language is stunning.
Not a quick read, I frequently had to stop and ponder many profound passages.
Literature as an art form is not dead
HI..
I would say most people should run, not walk, to buy this book.
It doesn't matter where you are starting from, everyone can benefit from this stuff, and there are a variety of ways to compile wealth that the authors talk about.
I found it to be very inspiring and well worth the money.
I would recommend it to all my friends, especially those who are befuddled by the markets, because it has simple straightforward advice.
good luck to all the savers and investors among us!
for socially conscious people, they also tell how to help society (as well as get wealthy.
Beautiful vineyards, fueding families, mystery, and an unlikely love story with a twist.
Great read.
Prepare to read this one through because it was hard to put down!!
!
If you are ready to take complete responsibility for yourself and live the joyful life then this is a must read.
I will say it is simple even thou I will avoid saying it is easy.
For your sake and your loved ones sake give this idea a go.
So, being a fan of all forms of literature, more specifically challenging[faulkner], pretentious[d.h. lawrence] and original[kafka] works, I was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what's considered Pynchon's most imporant work.
Important 40 years ago, perhaps, but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one.
Oh man, the radio station is KCUF, boy, that's incredibly clever, I bet it's, like, something spelled backwards.
I fully understand what Pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work, to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs, among other things, all while giving us a story with no particular plot, no moral, no message.
I can understand it, but it doesn't mean it's worth my time, I didn't even finish it.
I read about half and then just dropped it to the floor.
I've read in numerous reviews of Haruki Murakami's work that he's a latter day, Japanese, Pynchon.
I don't agree, Murakami's ability to create a surreal dream-like atmosphere is amazing, Pynchon is a hack
I wanted to like this book.
It's a great size for carrying around to dip into.
However, I'd say about a third, or maybe more, I haven't counted, are anonymous.
Here's an example: "Life is filled with possibilities" p31.
Now I don't know about you, but I'd hardly class that as great stuff from great minds.
Then I read "Decide what is worthwhile and follow through with it" and I'm beginning to yawn.
When I came to "Above all, life should be fun" and "Always keep a window open in your mind for new ideas" and I'm just about ready to throw the book into the garbage.
Also, the format of the book is terrible.
Someone decided to put every quote into a little frame, so you get four quotes on a page.
Still, for the price, it's not that bad.
No, on second thoughts it's pretty dire.
There's just too many pathetic jingles in here for me, which only motivate me to demand a refund!
If I were you, I'd save my money and put it towards something else - "The Book of Positive Quotations" has 7000 quotes and I wouldn't be without my copy
Most of the information is very "theoritical" and "limited" -- author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her.
...
In a nutshell, the message is that a dysfunctional mother'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter(s), and in turn, the daughter(s) may pass that onto her offspring(s).
...
A great reference book to have for any designer, although a little tedious at times a solid read with a great historical overview of the subject.
I would definitely recommend to any enthusiastic designer with a thirst for knowledge on things Typographical.
Since reading, I have become more critical of Typography in general and it works as a great guide when in doubt
Very good book but only buy it if you are looking for a book with a very strange sense of humor.
In the first story he explains his job as an Elf at Santaland and describes his daily life.
It is so funny, some of the things people do there are amazing and crazy at the same time.
Don't buy this book if you are looking for a nice book to read to your young kids or just sit in front of the fire reading a romantic book while it is snowing outside.
But if you are looking for something funny and odd at the same time, then by all means buy this book
The number of books written in our society is huge and getting huger.
Everyone recognizes that far more books are being written and published than can be read.
Why are people so anxious to be authors in such a market?
One reason, apparently embraced by the Goldstones, is that it is so EASY to write a book!
All you have to do is write down some reminiscences of your experiences.
They don't have to be particularly interesting experiences.
You don't have to do any research into your subject.
If you describe what all the people you encounter are wearing, if you go into details of how you found a babysitter for each trip you took, if you quote verbatim phone calls from relatives and shop keepers (even if they are not interesting or witty), and if you describe the hotel rooms you stayed in, you can finish the book in a couple of weekends!
And readers can finish the book in a couple of hours with little harm done.
The book does accurately represent the travails of beginning book collectors, and I recognized some of my own experiences in the stories the authors tell.
However, the book does not take the effort to educate readers so that they can skip over common early errors, nor does it attempt to answer many of the questions that the authors themselves raised when they first began collecting.
What determines the price of old books?
Why are first editions important?
Why should Tarzan books cost more than great works of literature?
These are good questions that anyone might think of when getting into book collecting, and you will find the questions but not the answers here.
The book is written in a breezy style that is easy to get through, and if you have two hours at an airport to kill, you could do worse than to read it.
But by the time you arrive at your destination, you will have likely forgotten most of what you just read, because so much of it is ephemeral details of the authors' own lives, transportation problems, and experiences.
If you are really interested in book collecting, it would be wise to read one of the many books that describe what one should look for, how prices are determined, different styles of book collecting, and so on.
Fragments of this knowledge are transmitted in this book, but they will leave you with more questions than answers.
To be sure, not every book about book collecting needs to be a font of wisdom.
But the entertainment value of the authors' experiences was weak, and did not make up for the absence of useful content
Kenneth Pollack first gives his readers an excellent introduction to the remarkable history of Iran from the rise of the Persian Empire to the reign of the Pahlavis (pp.
3-100).
Pollack shows clearly how nationalist and xenophobic Iran got wary of meddling foreigners, starting with the hated Russians and Brits, in its domestic affairs (pp.
4, 41).
Many Iranians have angry psychological scars, believing that foreigners are the source of all their problems for partially understandable reasons (pp.
26, 71, 89, 99, 125, 128, 155-56, 161, 173-74, 242, 297, 389).
Pollack focuses the bulk of his book on a balanced account of the troubled American-Iranian relations in the last 50+ years.
The U.S. started building its "satanic" reputation after the CIA played a key role in helping the Brits get rid of Iran's popular Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq in 1953 (pp.
57-67).
Mosaddeq's "crime" was the "illegal" nationalization of the Iranian oil industry under control of the rapacious Brits (pp.
52-56).
The U.S. did not improve its reputation among most Iranians by supporting the dictatorial Shah who largely mismanaged the modernization of Iran until his overthrow in 1979 (pp.
xxv, 72-140).
Pollack convincingly demonstrates that the Truman Administration and its successors usually did not exercise enough pressure on the Shah to democratize and liberalize Iran when they had the opportunity to do it (pp.
49, 76-77, 81, 89-90, 104, 121-24, 136-40).
The Shah, who was ironically considered sold out to the West, became less and less amenable to the "omniscient" U.S., beginning in the mid-1960s (pp.
39, 50, 84, 94, 99-100, 107, 120-27, 158, 173).
After the revolution of 1979, the U.S. mostly supported Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war and funded different destabilization operations to contain and try to overthrow the Islamic Republic (pp.
206-16, 259-65, 273-76, 386).
The U.S. apologized in 2000 for some past misdeeds in an unsuccessful attempt to improve its relations with Teheran under the presidency of the moderate but ultimately ineffective Mohammad Kathami, who was under relentless pressure from the hard-liners (pp.
xxv, 303-42).
Pollack blames with equal conviction the Iranians for the awful relations existing between both countries.
Iran has built its reputation of international pariah due to the illegal seizure of the U.S. embassy staff in 1979, its lack of democratic credentials, its support of terrorism around the world, its opposition to the Middle East peace process, and its pursuit of (nuclear) WMDs (pp.
xxi, 141-80, 182, 198-201, 237-40, 248, 256-59, 266-67, 277, 345, 379-82).
Pollack also explains to its readers that many Iranians have a poor understanding of the U.S. (pp.
50, 180, 309).
Pollack does not hesitate to show repeatedly that greed has not stopped the international community, including the U.S. at times, from doing business with Iran in the last 25+ years (pp.
164-65, 262-65, 271-72, 286-89).
Iran is trying without much success to emulate China by crushing internal dissent and favoring economic development (pp.
xxiv, 250, 369-73, 390-91).
The U.S. will be of no help in this endeavor as long as Iran stubbornly clings to its pursuit of acquiring nuclear military expertise on top of other objectionable actions (pp.
273, 312, 324, 351).
Pollack tries to crack the Iranian enigma by rightly ruling out an invasion of Iran due to its size, population, and topography (pp.
xxiii, 383-86).
Pollack ultimately pleads for a three-pronged strategy that rests on an unconvincing mix of carrots and sticks (pp.
375-424).
The U.S.-led international community seems to believe that Iran will "submit" to the "diktats" of foreigners in the nuclear crisis without undermining again the "legitimacy" of the hard-liners (pp.
xxv-xxvi, 157, 251, 352, 365, 395-400).
Hard-liners have not forgotten the humiliation of 1988 (pp.
227-33).
Nuclear WMDs would shield Iran from further "humiliating" foreign interference (pp.
259, 361-69).
The Shi'i hard-liners, inspired by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and co, relish martyrdom and heavy sacrifices (pp.
157, 177-79, 222-23, 302).
Like most of his predecessors, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is seeking confrontation with the international community as a way of diverting Iranians' attention from their problems for which ideology is a poor solution (pp.
158, 238, 243, 293-96, 348, 369-74).
Iranian hard-liners can find plenty of inspiration in the playbooks of Adolf Hitler and co.
The U.S. will discover again at its own expense that key countries will balk at acting responsibly after Iran predictably fails to comply with the legitimate demands of the society of nations (pp.
165, 262).
Iranian hard-liners consider weakness a defensive and reactive policy towards their offensive agenda (pp.
218, 234-35, 266, 300).
Nothing meaningful will happen until the implementation of very comprehensive economic / financial sanctions and the credible threat of massive strategic bombardments against the nuclear and revolutionary power infrastructure across Iran (pp.
299, 301, 392-95).
Iran has not been impressed with half-baked carrots like the Critical Dialogue and, with "Mini-Me" sticks such as Dual Containment and a few cruise missiles (pp.
265, 273-76, 283-84, 291, 337-38, 344, 391).
There will be no free lunch (p. 385).
Stepped-up war against (state-sponsored) terrorism will require a series of "patriotic" sacrifices to mitigate the inevitable, short-term sharp increase in energy prices.
Furthermore, there will be a new spike in terrorist operations as a "payback" for muscular action against Iran (pp.
253, 345-49, 354-58, 373, 392).
If Iran is not stopped before it acquires nuclear WMDs, it will indulge with a vengeance its own regional hegemonic aspirations not only in the Persian Gulf, but also in Central Asia (pp.
253-56).
Energy prices will not go down in this scenario.
Furthermore, Iranian hard-liners could consider Southern Russia and Chinese Xinjiang fair game for their revolutionary agenda due to the sub-optimal treatment of many Muslim minorities in these areas (pp.
198-205).
Their military nuclear program is not purely defensive.
Whoever ignores the past, will pay a heavy price down the road.
This book provides you with numerous analytical tools that can be used to quantify the strategic decision making process.
Not a real page turner but the models are useful and the case analysis provides real world examples of companies entering strategic crossroads.
Overall I think it provides the reader with a pragmatic way of managing the abundance of information involved in the strategic decision making process
While this book contains a ton of data, don't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade.
If you look up french toast, for example, it only gives information on name brand items.
Much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products.
I suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping, or use it before eating out, it would be helpful.
But if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items, you are out of luck with this book
Ehrman's work is not for a person of faith.
It does not take faith into consideration.
It is a wonderful research project based on limited documents available - most forged and falsified; and none which can be validated.
I read it as an immediate follow-up to his work "Lost Scriptures" - Books that did not make it into the New Testament.
I was warned by my minister who is also a Bible scholar and has two Ph.D.'s - and my minister was correct.
In Lost Christianities, Ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our current books of the New Testament by implying that many New Testament books may be false, forged, translated incorrectly, altered to serve a purpose, etc... Ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the New Testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the New Testament.
Ehrman's Lost Christianities starts out strong, but ends weak to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader.
If for nothing else, it is an attempt to test your faith, but in the end your faith will be strenghtened - if you have faith.
The book leads one to believe that the author is as much a Bible critic as he claims to be a scholar.
He does present all sides of the New Testament story and it is interesting how the New Testament was formed.
However, the lack of confirmed and validated documents will lead one to begin to question if Ehrman is accurate or merely sensationalizing much like the media does.
To save you the time and money, simply let your faith answer any questions you may have on the validity of the New Testament and how came to be.
Ehrman and other Bible critics (ie., The DeVinci Code) seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the New Testament story.
Save your money and give it to your church instead.

I found this book very boring.
Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen.
Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American.
I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of
This is the best book on creating wealth that I've ever read.
Study this book.
It's full of action points... not a bunch of fluff
Since so many others have outlined the general plot of this story (huge lawsuit against a hospital; suspicious deaths that may or may not have been committed by a doctor) I'll simply leave a brief comment.
Although the story isn't all that complicated, it was still a quick, enjoyable read--and the ending was one I didn't see coming.
Please be aware, though, that THE 5TH HORSEMAN is NOT an Alex Cross novel, which seemed to be one reviewer's complaint.
This is the story of Lindsay Boxer, SFPD Lieutenant and her fellow Women's Murder Club friends.
I found the story to be heartfelt and emotional, full of action-adventure, and, as I said, a very quick, satisfying read
I love Linda Howard books.
I always look forward to her releases and this book was a gross disappointment to say the least.
I think the characters are not developed well, and the relationship between Cal and Cate occurred too fast.
The story was rushed and I'm sure Linda could have done much better writing on this book.
I was disappointed with this novel which is set in my hometown of Chicago.
I had hoped that the author would have taken advantage of this setting, but it really seemed as if he had just read one of our gay newspapers and pulled out a few names to function as place names.
The plot is trite as are most of the characters.
Characters change their "stripes" at the drop of a hat.
The book has a certain fairy tale, and they lived happily ever after quality that I found really disconcerting.
I would have been more "satisfied" if Dean (the main character) had turned out to be an ax murderer!
Just kidding of course or am I?
If you can pick this book up used for a couple of bucks, okay but don't you pay a penny more
It's no wonder that people look at me strangely when I explain a great love of history to them.
It's books like this that persist in the ruination of history for many a student.
If this book were more widely circulated, the need for sleeping pills would be drastically reduced.
I have no idea how the author could take something this interesting and make it so boring that I would literally fall asleep reading it
It's been around two years since I first read this book, and i must say i reference it to people all the time.
the reason: it is so darn fascinating.
i really liked how the author put things in context and made me think about media forms and how we transfer data.
if i gave you an 8-track tape right now, would you know what to do with it to get the info contained on it?
younger folks might not know what it is.
they would recognize tape (maybe), but 100 years from now, how many players would be around?
the book talks about a project the author was on.
a nuclear waste site in new mexico needed to have a way to communicate to humans (or others) in the future that the site is radioactive.
since the radiation could last 10,000 years, the message would have to be able to be understood centuries from now.
what would the message be like?
if you read the book you'll find out!
lots of different ideas are kicked around and i just couldn't put the book down.
buy it, have fun
This book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough French to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory.
I found "French in 10 Minutes a Day" much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook
Peter Watson, holding a number of research degrees, offers a comprehensive intellectual history of the 20th century in this book.
Not being an easy read, it takes some time to get through.
The main strengths of this book are placing the intellectual development of the 20th century in its economic and social context.
This is quite an achievement, considering the remarkable scientific and technological advances and the fragmentation of human knowledge into many small and specialised areas in very arcane topics.
Watson tends to cover science the best, and provides excellent accounts of the development and progress of 20th century science, including the theories of relativity, quantum mechanics, scientific cosmology, evolutionary biology and the discovery of the gene.
However, the book falls down in some parts where it covers philosophy.
Watson dismisses Husserl's Phenomenology as 'abstract' and of little importance, when in fact Phenomenology was probably the most important philosophical school in the 20th century along with analytical philosophy, founded by Russell and Wittgeinstein, and attracted so many leading European minds to philosophy in a time when science was at its zenith of glory.
Overall though, Watson's work is a very important attempt to see where we are in what we know, and where we are going.
No wonder John Gardner didn't write more fiction books.
He was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction, rather than actually writing it.
"Creative atrophy" I believe John Gardner himself would call it.
If there's ever been a better example of the "those who can't do, teach" argument, I haven't encountered it.
This is hardly the place a "Young Writer" should start.
Instead, how about reading what you like and avoiding "ignoramouses" such as John Gardner?
John Gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world's finest writers never made it through college, and many more didn't have the luxury of a "rigorous classical education."
The most hilarious part is where Gardner mentions that only through a line-by-line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy Shakespeare.
It's interesting to note how Gardner, who "taught" creative writing at the university level, fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education
I would love to read a neutral book on Barry Bonds, I hate cheerleader type books about players but I also hate one-sided ones as well.
The only good things he really has to say about Bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous Marge (whom he then sarcastically remarks that Bonds was only her second favorite player).
The book covers a wide variety of topics, some are puzzeling.
While most of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex-wife for being an exotic dancer.
I was pretty upset to read that, I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that.
This book came out right after (or because of) Game of Shadows.
This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for illegal activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information, guess that backfired Pearlman.
In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well.
The book uses many annoymous sources (there is a reference sheet in the back, most of those articles all include quotes from many unidentified sources), so its really hard to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is heresay.
The book pretty much discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people, they like to find good stories.
That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling thier eyes at the sheer stupidity of it.
Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now.
Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that most writers do that.
So once again, the biggest problem is that it fails to stay on neutral ground.
This would be like writing a book about Babe Ruth and only mentioning that he beat up umpires, ran into the stands to attack people, slept with hookers, drank all the time, was mean to Lou Gherig, etc.
While that may be true it would also only tell one part of the story and would be a waste, just like this
I give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that Nicholas Wade has presented and in the manner it was presented, "DNA and the Secret Family of Thomas Jefferson."
This most difinitive "unproven" statement leads the unsuspecting reader to believe that he "seems" to know so much about genetics and early man that he knows all about the Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study and for what "reason" he sees fit to include it into a serious scientific book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers.
He seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the Jefferson-Hemings controversy.
Unless I overlooked it, I saw no reference to the excellent work that genetist Spencer Wells is performing for National Geographic Socity.
I assisted this study by providing access to Jefferson DNA sources.
The result of a match was found in the early Phoenicians,(Caanites mentioned in the bible)and in lands that today are Syria and Lebanon.
From what I know of the study (I assisted Dr. E.A.
Foster with the DNA study), Mr. Wade's analysis of this is extremely limited, in fact, it is extremely biased.
"Thomas Jefferson fathered an unacknowledged family with his slave mistress Sally Hemings" (pg 257).
What truthful fact does he have to give this statement?
He makes the most of giving details by lying James Callender and lying Samuel Wetmore/Madison Hemings in Pike Co., Ohio.
Why the details in a book topic such as this?
I will give you serious readers on the serious DNA topic my opinion.
As you may see in my several reviews of other biased books, these authors know nothing of the details of the DNA Study but spread old early biased media tales.
He did not inform you that a team of blue ribbon scholars (13 senior professors) for the Scholars Commission ([...]) and determined that there is no proof that Jefferson is guilty of these charges.
You may read on my web page: www.angelfire.com/va/TJTruth all the details of this study.
He cannot plead ignorance of the details because I sent him my research early in the media blitz and any reporter not using the many search engines to thoroughly search a subject is most suspect in my opinion.
Can any serious researcher read his book and believe he/she is receaving accurate knowledge.
My knowledge of the other topics he has written about is limited, BUT I do know this Jefferson-Hemings Study and he has done no current or original research.
He references Annette Gordon-Reed as some type of "authority" on the controversy.
She was charged by the Scholars Commission Report as having completely rearranged a letter from Jefferson's grand-daughter to give a negative meaning to her words.
To add insult to his otherwise feeble attempt to influence your thinking, Wade has a figure with the title, "Thomas Jefferson Family with Sally Hemings.(Pg.260-261)."
His lack of knowledge of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson is most lacking in current research because he goes into details that Martha Jefferson and Sally Hemings are half-sisters (an old political rumor brought forward by people wishing to confuse readers and to be politically correct.
He does not mention a very scholarily book by Dr. and Mrs. James McMurry, "Anatomy of a Scandal, Thomas Jefferson and the Sally Story", who did deep research on this rumor and found it a lie designed to fit earlier political mud slinging.
Since he did not give the reader another source for study, another VERY interesting book, "Jefferson Vindicated, Falacies, Omissions,and Contradictions in the Hemings Genealogical Search", I will tell you it has a foreword by former Monticello Director, James A, Bear, Jr. All of the named books, including, "The Jefferson-Hemings Myth" are available through Amazon.
I do agree with Wade's last sentence on the Jefferson-Hemings controversy......."Some mysteries lie beyond the power of even DNA to resolve."
I might add that contrived history is intertwined with DNA and even the Hemings will NOT permit the gathering of "another" Hemings DNA source.....only ONE originally tested.

While I found the writing style good and the information interesting, the actual diet was unrealistic, too restrictive and lacking fun basics that make other diets tolerable.
I found myself longing for spices (how bad could pepper really be?)
and questioning the validity of their restriction.
I couldn't stand the ground-up flax seeds in my cranberry cocktail - the texture reminded me of trying to drink mud with little bugs in it (or what I imagine that to be).
I'm not writing this to disparage anyone from trying the diet - if you can handle the restrictions and you have the self-control required, you might find this diet doable and rewarding.
I tried the Fat Flush with a group from work - inspired by one woman who is able to do the flush again and again every year (she always gains the weight back).
The rest of us, while successful for varying degrees of short periods, found the diet unrealistic for any long-term results - all of us gained the weight back and spurred by instant weight loss, some even picked up worse habits than they began with.
The funny thing is I found much of the health information useful or interesting, but I got rid of the book b/c sitting on my shelf it reminded me of unrealistic goals and failure - not what I want out of a get-healthy plan.
I'm writing this review so that others don't get sucked in by all of the positive reviews hoping for lasting results - 3 of us didn't have any
I do not think the man who "translated" the Koran here is a true Muslim.
One cannot shuffle and reorder the Suras to suit one's own taste.
This man does not have the right to mess up our Holy Book in this way.
Plue the style of writing is not nearly as engaging as the Ali version.
I have not been in a Mosque yet that had this version of the Koran on its shelves.
You can go into any Mosque in this country and pick up a copy of the Ali Tranlation for free.
Why waste your money on this Infidel sham version?
This book is full of excuses and manipulated data that ignores the ultimate moral responsibility of a society.
We can correlate joblessness with the number of innercity households that contain black ink pens if we want to.
While Wilson presents an argument in an attempt to educate, his words are slanted in such a way that we are left feeling "sorry for them"
pppppppppp quot;I pppppppppp quot; is for I think you would like this book if you read it.
It was a little bit wordy at the beginnig but each page gets better than the one before.
You will be glad you got past the first few pages because it gets a lot more interesting as you go along.
And the ending of this book is really something else, it makes the whole book well worth reading.
I really liked the book and I think you will too
I had read such glowing reviews of this book, and had enjoyed other Creamer works so thoroughly that I was suprised how uninspired I was while reading this.
Perhaps I failed to be dazzled by Stengel the man.
Perhaps I grew tired of the predictable retelling of Stengel's life, season by season, many of which held no remarkable events.
Baseball in '41 is a much more rewarding book, full of wonderful anecdotes well recounted
I realize that this is the only book currently on the market for the 993, aside from spending a small fortune on the actual shop manuals (on CD's), but after receiving the book and spending several nights giving it a good read, I have come to the conclusion that someone will be hard pressed to put together anything so accurate and complete.
This is a must for any 993 owner!
kurt vonnegut's book slaughterhouse five is a great piece of literary work in itself.
his unique style of black humor, combined with his vivid imagination is second to none.
this book was exciting and unpredictable as i continued to read!
its main purpose involved the struggle of a man with his grip on reality.
is he, or is he not crazy?
the imagery in this book was another great element, and many regard this as one of the greatest anti-war books of the century.
this book is definitely worth reading and will not disappoint!
you can't go wrong with kurt vonnegut's slaughterhouse five
This is one of the best -- and scariest -- business books I've ever read.
Christensen clearly illustrates why many of the 'tried and true' formulas really don't work.
His research is compelling and is presented clearly enough for non-technical readers.
I can't recommend this book highly enough
I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses.
After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.
After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."
Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,
I appreciate anyone's attempts to examine the deeper nature of life and share that with the rest of us.
However, I could see a hole in Csikszentmihalyi's attempt from the beginning.
"In the course of my studies I tried to understand as exactly as possible how people felt when they most enjoyed themselves, and why.
My first studies involved a few hundred "experts"--artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons, in other words, people who seem to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred."
I'm surely not alone in wondering why on earth one would presume the above professions are strictly happy and "optimal experience".
Particularly the reference to artists and musicians, who typically have severe struggles with life, and aren't on cloud nine just because some professors might like them in a couple hundred years.
That is what I felt was the very weak point of the book--a study of happiness with almost no reference to unhappiness.
It goes on to talk about ways to find flow in our ordinary life, while dodging the bullet continually about why if flow was all those great people needed, did they still encounter countless problems and unhappiness.
I recently picked up a copy of Mage: The Awakening not knowing quite what to expect.
Since Ars Magica I've loved Mage.
From GURPs I quickly switched over to White Wolf's editions of Mage: The Ascension, finally setting on the revised copy most commonly used on game sites today.
Mage: The Ascension Revised was truly a delight, featuring a complexity never seen before in role playing games.
A complexity that made working magic truly fun, sure there were flaws, without a good Storyteller you could easily abuse the open ended magic system to do absolutely anything you wanted... but it was a good price to pay for flexibility, interesting possibilities and an all around great RP system.
Is it fair to compare Mage: The Awakening with Mage: The Ascension Revised?
Of course not, the game has to be based on its own merits and flaws.
The problem is that this game seems to suffer from a lack of creativity which pervades the RP modern RP market.
It also seems to be marketed toward a very specific audience.
With the exception of some really interesting RP books (White Wolf's translation of "Engel" from the German, a role playing experience distinct onto itself and wholly creative, and "Demon: The Fallen" - which was unfortunately a flop and still managed to be creative), RP books are typically very bland and all the same.
Mage: The Awakening is no different.
Unfortunately it tries to blend easy mechanics with simple spells as though past Mage books have been too complicated (which they haven't, unless the new World of Darkness market is much younger than they previously were... which is a possibility, or perhaps they aren't interested in realistic depth so much as they are just having quick fun).
There is absolutely nothing culturally significant about the Mage: The Awakening game system.
If you enjoyed the Buddhist, Hindu, the various forms of Christian, Judaic and other religious outlooks being present in your game system, Mage: The Awakening takes a step back from the pluralism/intellectually stimulating material found in its predecessors and offers a quick, fun system with no lasting appeal.
The background story of Mage: The Awakening is simply terrible.
Sure reviews constantly pick on Atlantis, but for a good reason: there's simply nothing else to pick on!
The Awakening is simply devoid of any depth whatsoever, but what it does do is provide some interesting magic rotes (spells) instead.
Another problem is that there are no antagonists.
In previous Mage games there were antagonists you could use or not use depending on your game.
In Awakening they don't even offer any choices.
This game is obviously less popular online and more popular in tabletop settings (online, where depth is usually called for, Mage: The Ascension is still used quite frequently).
Some positive qualities about the book are that it has an excellent production value and it provides a concrete game system to play with.
Provided you had an excellent Storyteller present with lots of storyline ideas, you might have a fun tabletop session.
But quite frankly aside from the production value I can't recommend this book.
The largest problem of all is that it simply has nothing distinctive about it... nothing to make it stand out and be worth playing over previous game systems.
In an age of simplicity please do yourself a favor and have a little patience and find yourself a good Storyteller.
Go back and read the books that made this one sell like hotcakes - buy the "real" Mage books - if you still want to, pick up a copy of The Awakening and somehow incorporate it in your game
This was the first novel I read from Endo, and I have to confess to being hooked on it from the first.
It is both interesting from a historical perspective, taking in an event that was singularly fascinating, and deeply profound from a psychological perspective.
It is also a partial critique of ambition and desire in the clergy of the day.
Hasekura is a deep character, and the reader spends a bit of time with Hasekura's thoughts.
This is especially so as Hasekura confronts the emaciated, dying Christ that he sees on his travels toward Rome.
The possibility of faith in this "pathetic man", and the conflict that produces with his duty to Lord and ancestors, forms a a deeply emotional narrative coupled with Hasekura's desires, dreams and simple wishes.
The psychological aspect of the book is very well presented and notable in its impact.
A notable part of the book is tied up with Father Velasco, whose ambition seems to know no limits.
His own struggles with ambition, and the self-justifications that he employs, are a lesson worthy of remembering.
This novel is a great one, and I was hooked to the very last page.
It will take you into the world of Hasekura, Velasco and their companions, as they themselves see it.
It will take you into their dreams, their hopes, their fatalism, their fears and their struggles to cope with their situation.
I totally, unreservedly recommend this novel.
I love this novel
I was stunned to see so many critical reviews of this book here.
Even more stunned by the criticisms.
This is not a scientific treatise, and never pretends to be.
This is not an introduction into the more abstract and obscure aspects of Emergence, nor is it a dry and tedious mathematical paper.
This is an interesting, graspable, exciting and intelligently written book about a phenomenon which is absolutely, positively crucial to understand.
To some people Emergence is a particular abstract in a particular field - those people were disappointed and found this "light reading" - which is really too bad, because they are the ones who NEED this book the most.
Alas, we can expect it to be a while before these "scientist" can look outside their own shallow mud-puddles of their over-specialties to see how applicable emergent theory is to the world we are immersed in, both natural and man-made.
If you didn't find this book exciting, you didn't read it.
Sit down and read it without distraction and prejudice.
Let Johnson do what he does best; take you on a journey of ideas and concepts.
Sure, some of it is simplified for the lay-reader, but anybody who isn't a total couch-potato is going to find the content interesting enough to set-out and search for details on their own.
It isn't Johnson's goal to elaborate on some trivial and fragmentary specialty that only people with masters degrees and secured positions in academia could possibly enjoy or tolerate.
His goal is to show what emergence IS and why it is SO important, how vast the concepts are in their potential application in every imaginable field, and how elegant, simple, complex, chaotic, and BEAUTIFUL emergence IS !
And he does exactly this quite well.
If you read this book and are not excited, you didn't get it.
Read it again.
And again.
Look up the examples of emergence, and try to actually find your own examples of emergence in YOUR world, in YOUR daily experience.
The enrichment you'll gain from it will be worth a lot more than any silly over-specialty in an obscure field of research that nobody has ever hear
Even with the questionable veracity, I enjoyed Frey's first book, A Million Little Pieces, since it stayed true to an addict's experience.
Leonard, on the other hand, came off as pure fantasy, with very little substance.
Even the description of Frey's struggle was too contrived to be believable.
It was not even interesting as fiction.
This is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read--with no background in either philosophy or cybernetics, much of what Hayles discusses is just plain incomprehensible.
I also found it difficult to accept the idea of humans already being pppppppppp quot;post-human.
pppppppppp quot; If you are interested in deep philosophical writings on technology and the human condition, with links to literature, read this.
If you don't really care about the post-human, skip it
It pppppppppp #8217;s been two years since the recovery of The Amulet of Samarkand, and Nathaniel (now known as John Mandrake) is a Government official in the Office of Internal Affairs, apprenticed to Jessica Whitwell.
His job is to hunt down a pack of rebellious commoners known as the Resistance, who have been causing a series of disturbances in London, aiming to destabilize the rule of the magicians.
He suspects the involvement of a girl named Kitty and her friends whom we met in his previous adventure, and although correct in this assumption, it soon becomes obvious that there is deeper evil afoot, as a destructive force hidden in a black cloud begins attacking the city, destroying buildings and magical artifacts as it goes.
When things start spiraling out of control, he is forced to call upon Bartimaeus again for help, and the adventure spirals into a saga of grave robbery, political maneuvers, foreign travel and ancient magic.
Though certainly not as good as the first, and a little too long, The Golem pppppppppp #8217;s Eye makes for good reading, but is sadly lacking the sarcastic witticisms of everyone pppppppppp #8217;s favorite djinn that were the high point of book one.
Amanda Richards, May 20, 2006
Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.
I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.
Believe me, it is not one of her best.
I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.
It also took way too long to get to the real story.
The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.
Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.
How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?
The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.
I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.
Unfortunately some audio books are read in monotone-very dull indeed-but in this audio book the reader goes too far in the opposite direction by reading an adult book as if it's story time and she's a preschool teacher.
My daughters and I loved the main characters in audio books such as Bridget Jones Diary, The Nanny Diaries, and Sammy's Hill because the reader made us sympathize with them.
We knew that whatever the characters did they did with sincerity and whatever happened to them could happen to anyone.
Emily Gray, the reader of Can You Keep a Secret, made the main character sound witless and very, very phony.
All of the other characters sounded one dimensional.
We listen to audio books on our frequent long car trips.
Although we had nothing else to listen to at the time, we could only stand of this book before we had to turn it off.
A few weeks later I randomly read a few chapters of Can You Keep a Secret in a bookstore and thought that it was amusing.
Perhaps Emily Gray didn't find the book amusing, so she thought that she needed to go "over the top" to add humor.
If so, it didn't work.
She took a lighthearted, enjoyable book and turned it into the equivalent of listening to nails on a blackboard.
Since almost all of my good girl friends (including myself) have gone through nasty breakups lately, I have become much like the Gideons in that I have practically resorted to buying a case full of these fabulous books and carrying them around in my trunk, distributing them to my poor, heartbroken friends.
It is the perfect thing to read when you're in that post-breakup stay-in-bed-in-your-pyjamas-and-eat-ice-cream stage.
Beautiful, beautiful work.
If all you have to complain about this book is that you didn't learn how to properly can, you're missing the point.
Pay the extra 5 bucks and spring for the lovely hardcover -- it's worth it.
I cannot say enough wonderful things about this scrumptious, funny, simple little insightful jewel!
Mwah
I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end.
There are some very touching passages that get to the heart of what a good marriage is and the unique bond that husband and wife share.
I am glad this story wasn't about finding new love soon after losing someone who was clearly her best friend and soul mate.
For the most part it is about finding other areas of pleasure in your life through exploring different types of bonds with friends old and new.
It is also about new beginnings while still honoring the memory of the one she's lost.
I could read this novel over and over.
The deep respect for marriage is refreshing in a world that can be dismissive of marriage's sanctity and too often focused on those that fail
"Karl Marx, years ago, gave a description of why this might be happening.
He followed the most moral and meritocratic theory for wealth and value: an object is worth as much as the effort it takes to make."
NO IT'S NOT!!!
An object's worth is based upon both the supply of an object and the demand for it arrising from consumers.
To imply that it comes from the effort it takes to make implies that a milkshake that takes only a few minutes to make is worth far less than a vial of poison that took an hour to make or an atomic bomb that took months to make, which would mean that we should subsidize the military-industrial complex, since all those workers worked hard to create those deadly things.
"Petty-bourgeois' owners, i.e.
the mom-and-pop stores and small business in general, of which my grandpa, a dentist, was a part of, are being driven under by corporate chain competition in retail."
This is either to the innefficiency in their store to meet consumer demands or to the massive regulations burdened upon them by the government.
All regulations do nothing but add an increased burden on to competition and thus kills them out.
There's a reason why the owner's of Wal-Mart recently said that the federal government should increase the minimum wage to over $8, as this would cause many smaller businesses to go bankrupt, lay off employees, and prevent future businesses from starting up to compete with Wal-Mart.
Another problem is the subsidies that the smaller store pays to Wal-Mart (Wal-Mart collects millions in subsidies due to Marx's Labor Theory of Value once again) and of the use of emminent domain abuse (which can be justified on the grounds of the "greater good" as opposed to the individual good of your mom and pop stores).
"But no theory is ever flawless, and socialists should be able to correct their past flaws to account for human nature and "reality."
There is no reason to believe that heavy social hierarchy and class division is a necessary evil; workers CAN manage their lives just fine through cooperatives."
Sure there is.
Human beings are inherently unequal, differing in many skills, abilities, ambition, the choices that they make in life, how they apply their time, etc.
etc.
Of course, there is isn't any reason that individuals can't create wealth nonetheless, creating goods and services that help others out in exchange for some good or service itself.
And cooperatives need to be voluntary first.
Nor can cooperatives produce the bulk of wealth.
There needs to be some Division of Labor, Trade and Commerce, etc.
or else all cooperatives end up as hunter-gatherering tribes reduced to the real law of the jungle to survive.
This can't happen if everything is collectively owned.
"Since workers are the sole producers of goods from scratch to end" NO!
Entreprenuers, innovators, etc.
provide much of the creativity, design, direction for the purchase and use of capital goods, negotiation of deals, evaluation of threats, problems, and consumer requests, and other such things.
It wasn't the workers at Microsoft who created cheap desktop computers, it was Bill Gates, the workers are merely a form of mass-production who help out, but ultimately mass produce a good or service in exchange for privately owned wages, caused by supply and demand.
While expertly crafted, this is not a pretty novel, nor is it gentle.
The subject matter -- abduction of a child -- is somber, as are a few gruesome descriptions of death and dying.
The plot twists and turns, as befits a LeHane novel, and one way or another this complicated story finds its way to a denouement which the reader may not find satisfying.
But you can usually trust Lehane to take good care of you in this, one of his finer books.
And not only are there plot twists to wrestle with, there are more than a few serious moral issues that will have you squirming or at least scratching your head.
All in all, this was a solid, enjoyable thriller.
The reader will feel his time was not wasted
If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.
This book is worse than bad.
It is an abomination
Histoire et Collections has done it again.A fine work of the quality which the collector and researcher has come to expect from this publisher.
I have previous works on the British Tommy in NW Europe and Canadian soldiers.
All are elaborately illustrated with charts, individual item photos, and reconstructions worn by models of combinations of equipment and clothing as qoen in northern Europe.
In addition there are many lists, charts, and tables gathering together informatioon gleaned from many scarce and obscure publications.
Muxh of rhia work has appeared in the excellent French language periodical Militaria published also by Histoire et Collections.
This method of proceeding has the great virtue of first publishing in a more temporary format and inviting the readers to submit corrections and additional data which can be used to improve the final work published in book form
Pat was right!
Anyone read the news lately?
Bush has succeeded only in creating more terrorists.
Mission accomplished.
Buchanan may have some whacky views about illegal aliens, but he knows his foreign policy when it comes to warfare and economics.
If he and Ralph Nader didn't dislike eachother so much they would no doubt make the best running mates this country has seen in half a century.
I purchased this book after having seen Super Size Me and I was a little worried that there would be nothing new for Morgan to present.
I, however, was proven wrong.
This is a very good read that is able to put down more statistics and specifics about the food industry that the movie was not as focuses on.
The movie, of course, was focused mostly on the fast food industry.
Morgan Spurlock is always a surprise.
You seem him with his long sideburns and know he is from West Virginia and you just expect the stereotype.
He is not a stereotype.
The book is written in a very clear voice, the same intelligent humorous voice that came across in the movie, "Super Size Me."
My one disappointment is that I was hoping the book would have more details about the diet that his girlfriend put him on when he finished his 30 days, but now I see she has her own book.
Ah, marketing!
I think you can read this as stand alone but as everyone notes, it works great in conjunctions with the movie to help you not forget
My mother in-law was actually responsible for Billy Milligan while he was in the Athens State hospital in Ohio.
I've had a chance to read this book, and although very good, what my mother-in-law tells me is much, much different.
She cared for him during his entire stay there.
She said that he had more psychology and parapsychology books in his room than she could have ever imagined.
She also said that his IQ was off the charts.
She believes (and she has a doctorate in psychology) he only has FOUR distinct personalities.
Raven being one of them.
Billy had the abilitiy and knowledge to manipulate his condition, making it appear much more severe.
Of course, she can't write anything about this, because Billy's publicist made everyone caring for him sign a waiver saying they wouldn't.
Yes... Billy Milligan has a publicist.
He also was a millionaire (because he exploited his disease) and drove a corvette on the weekends they let him go home.... yep... they let Billy Milligan have weekends.
This book is a very good interpretaion on what could possibly been going on in Billy's head.
However, after talking with someone who was actually there, and knew him well.... makes me second guess the validity of it
Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience.
The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths.
There are concepts to be learned from the five people.
The story is delightful and cavalier.

Bruce Schneier offers an excellent 'big picture' overview of the computer security field.
From types of attacks, to algorithm security to security in the context of your data center, you get a full overview of the current practices and consequences arising from them.
The author argues for security as a process, not a product; security is not something you can add to your product after the fact.
Starting from the product specification, down to your last outsourced programmer, security has to permeate your organization for it to work.
Building 'attack trees', relying on peer review and enforcing liability are all suggestions advanced by Bruce Schneier.
Secrets and Lies is a well organized book with plenty of real world examples, problems and solutions.
Buy a copy for yourself, and many more for everybody else you know, we will all benefit in the end.
I love this little recipe book!
It is very simply written, but informative -- everything from what a crepe is and how to turn them, stack them, freeze them, and thaw them, to diagrams on folding crepes and blintzes, and, of course, the recipes: the basic crepe recipe followed by all the variations, as well as dessert crepes and blintzes.
Haven't tried very many yet, but am looking forward to it -- especially the orange dessert crepes
As a one-time practicing physicist (now just an "arm-chair physicist") and lifetime music lover, I have found this beautifully-written little book irresistible over the 17 years it has been in my library.
In 1983, when the original hardcover edition came out, this book was given to me as a gift by someone knowing my musical tastes, figuring that it would be the perfect gift.
It turned out to be, but for reasons that are largely non-musical.
As an arm-chair scientist, I've read and enjoyed more than a few popularizations by well-known scientists over the years.
These include Richard Feynman with his wry humor in virtually everything he wrote (I number myself among those physicists who "cut their eye teeth" on the Feynman Lectures in Physics), Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene, Carl Sagan, and even Brian Swimme.
(The Swimme of "A Walk Through Time" goes down easily, and covers much of the same ground that Thomas does, but in a quite different way; the Swimme of "The Universe is a Green Dragon" is a much harder sell for me due to its hard-pressed attempt to oversimplify.)
But for sheer elegance and poetry and breadth of scope, and for essays that provoke thought on the part of the reader, none can hold a candle to Thomas.
Everyone who reads this little masterpiece will have his or her favorites.
Here are a few of mine: In "Things Unflattened by Science" (an essay on unaddressed and/or incomplete challenges that future scientists might well undertake), a paragraph on how biologists might endeavor to better understand what music is, and how it affects the human condition, starting with a rather small-scale assignment to explain the effect of Bach's "The Art of Fugue" on the human mind.
In "Altruism" (an essay on the symbiotic interrelationships among species), how it is that such a condition actually exists, and a challenge to future scientists to better understand how our own species might become more altruistic (and adult) than it presently is.
In "The Attic of the Brain" (a cautionary essay on the risks of psychiatry, most importantly psychoanalysis, in terms of performing "total brain dumps"), the need for all of us to carry around a little clutter in our lives, as insurance against the chance that we might inadvertently lose our ability to retrieve something truly important.
In the title (and final) essay, another cautionary tale, this time on thermonuclear weaponry, the most lucid description I've ever read regarding the true meaning of this music as envisioned by Gustav Mahler.
In a few brief but sublime paragraphs, Thomas has captured the essence of this remarkable opus in a way that no musician (and that includes such Mahlerites as Bernstein, Karajan, Klemperer, Rattle and Walter) ever had.
Until very recently, that is, with the release a few months back of a staggering performance by Benjamin Zander, conductng the Philharmonia Orchestra.
But that is another topic, and another review.
In the seventeen years since the initial publication of this book, quite a bit has changed in our worldview, in some aspects of society and science.
But not enough!
The observations and challenges that Thomas lays out will endure for centuries, provided only that we endure as well.

The Plot: After an emotional burnout, both Elias Winters and Charity Truitt are ready for a change.
Each ends up moving to Whispering Waters Cove and operating a shop on Crazy Otis Landing.
The two are instantly attracted and end up investigating a murder together.
I've read this book twice.
Initially, I was disappointed in this book.
I had just finished reading several other JAK novels.
Similar plots, similar characters with similar backgrounds .
... Reading this a second time without the JAK marathon, I found it an enjoyable read.
The characters are likable and respectable.
Good mystery.
Amusing read
Charlie Bone isn't your typical nine-year-old boy.
Although he didn't know that himself.
But when photographs get mixed up and he ends up with a picture of a man and a little girl that talks to him, he knows everything that was normal about his life is gone forever.
Tracking down the picture, Charlie finds out it belongs to Miss Ingledew, a woman who owns a bookshop and has been looking for her missing niece for years.
She gives Charlie a mysterious package (that he can't open) and sets him on his journey that will change everything in his world.
As it turns out, Charlie is one of the descendants of the Red King, a mysterious person who had wondrous magical powers who went into hiding.
The Red King's children have been equally divided between good and evil ever since.
At Bloor's Academy, Charlie finds friends and enemies, and the challenge of his lifetime as he tracks down secrets others don't want revealed.
Jenny Nimmo is the author of five books in the Charlie Bone series and has written several other children's books and fantasies.
Many people compare Charlie Bone to Harry Potter, and that's a good comparison.
But the two series are different.
Harry's family is really non-supportive, but Charlie has a loving mother, a doting grandmother, and Uncle Paton, who turns out to be something of a hero.
The book is a fun, fast-paced whirlwind of mysteries, magic, and friendship.
Even at 400 pages, it feels like it's over much too soon.
There are a few jarring instances where the point-of-view was disconnected, moving from one character and one scene into another without warning.
They were easily overlooked due to the pacing of the story, but noticeable all the same.
Fans who are waiting for the next Harry Potter book who haven't tried the Charlie Bone series are encouraged to do so.
Charlie's story, although similar, has much to offer in reading excitement
The Chronicles of Narnia by accaimled author C.S.
Lewis is worth every penny.
I bought a copy for myself, but I am saving it for when my son learns to read.
The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe will move you if are you 25 or 5 and the story is a of such a kind--that you are the better for reading it
Not as good as pppppppppp quot;Entre Nous pppppppppp quot; - less fun and more acedemic.
But even then it is not a well written essay.
The few good salient points are repeated too often, and with not much creativity or development
Like many others in my book group, I had been looking forward to finally reading something by Pamuk.
And like most of my book group, I was fairly disappointed by this short early novel from him.
Originally published in Turkey in 1985, the story is prefaced by an introduction in which one Faruk Darvinoglu purports to have discovered the manuscript in a dusty archive.
He then goes on to explain that parts of the story can be historically corroborated, but much of it can't.
This should immediately alert the reader not to take everything in the book as it comes.
Even more so if the reader knows that Darvinoglu is the protagonist of Pamuk's earlier book The House of Silence.
Such intertextual tricks immediately bring to mind the works of Calvino, Borges, and their ilk.
The basic plot is very straightforward: in the mid 17th-century, a young Venetian gentleman is captured by Turkish raiders and sold into slavery to an aspiring Turkish scholar who happens to look just like him.
The two men then spend the next few decades cloistered together, engaged in various psuedo-intellectual investigations of astronomy, biology, engineering, and so on.
These bring them to the attention of the Sultan (based on Mehmet IV), whose patronage waxes and wanes, culminating in a lengthy attempt to construct a powerful war machine.
Along the way, their claustrophobic relationship swings back and forth, and is interrupted by an outbreak of the plague, whose outcome they are tasked with predicting.
The book concludes with a brief section which will challenge the reader's assumptions and calls into question everything that comes before it.
Namely, are there two characters or are they just manifestations of two aspects of a single person?
This all unfolds at a glacial pace, and the two "characters" are mere ciphers.
Their clashing of wills and ideas take up page after page, but the reader is always told about the conflict rather than shown it, and this makes for disengaging reading.
Pamuk seems much less interested in storytelling or characters than in grand themes such as the nature of identity, the collision of cultures, and the very nature of reality.
But none of these are addressed in a way that is particularly fresh or interesting.
The tension between East and West is handled in a fairly superficial manner, as the Turkish master is obsessed with Western advances in science and technology, while the Sultan has a credulous appetite for tall tales and soothsayers.
This all comes across as a rather ambivalent satire of the fluidity of Turkish national character.
In the end, this is not a particularly good introduction to major modern writer whom many have compared to Eco, Calvino, Borges, Kafka, and Kundera.
However, readers who enjoy highly ambiguous works about self-identity with unreliable narrators may find this a satisfying read
My all time favorite book is Deavers THE BLUE NOWHERE and The Testament by another author.
I think this book is on the bottom of my list.
It was a combo term paper and novel.
I wonder where the editor of this book is.
Where was he/she?
It read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them.
Don't worry Jeff, I'll still buy your next book...I've bought them all but please ...get a second opinion about your editor.
I good editor wouldn't have let it go out in this shape.
I liked most of Jo Beverly's books.
In fact, she is one of my favorite romance writers.
That's why it's hard to believe she could write something so boring and contrived.
The premise -- saving an opium addict--- is good.
One could expect a lot of turmoil between the lovers.
But no -- it's all pretty smooth.
The passion is tepid and not much else happens.
A series of "Rogues" from previous books is paraded before the reader without really adding to the story.
And the conversations are so boring that I simply had to skip them.
I guess this may be enjoyable to new romance readers who do not know better or hard core Beverly fans
There are many books on ARM's architecture or manual references.
So far, this book is the only book which concentrates on the firmware development side.
Both assembly language and C are discussed, which is a relief for embedded/firmware engineers like me who like to combine both languages in a project.
The 15 chapters in the book are: 1- ARM Embedded Systems 2- ARM Processor Fundamentals 3- Introduction to the ARM instruction set 4- Introduction to the Thumb instruction set 5- Efficient C Programming 6- Writing and Optimizing ARM assembly code 7- Optimized Primitives 8- Digital Signal Processing 9- Exception and Interrupt Handling 10- Firmware 11- Embedded Operating Systems 12- Cache 13- Memory Protection Units 14- Memory Management Units 15- The Future of the Architecture The strength of this book lies on the extensive examples on how to program ARM effectively.
It is a nice guide for those who want to learn ARM programming style
The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise: a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.
It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.
But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.
Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.
However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.
Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.
Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.
There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.
There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.
Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.
This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.
By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.
And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.
Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.
The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.
Ah yes, the danger posed.
Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.
The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.
Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".
By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.
The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.
Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.
This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.
It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress: some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.
But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.
I just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to NYC from Barcelona.
My mouth watered as I read the included reprints of her past reviews of NYC restaurants - even after my five days of fantastic Spanish cuisine!
But more surprisingly, I was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the NYC restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many "characters".
The book left me such respect for the depths that Ruth Reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience, especially in NYC's "best" restaurants.
Her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective (as objective as food tastes get, I suppose) review.
A very easy and enjoyable read.
After trying 2 recipes, I thought that I was a pretty bad cook.
So, I asked my friend, a very good cook, to try a couple more recipes.
She had the same results.
Disgusting!!
These recipes must not have been kitchen tested.
Mine as well just boil some chicken and dump a can of cream of mushroom soup on top.
The results would be better.
Stay away
A writer for the Irish Echo said this book should have been titled "The Protocols of the Elders of Erin."
It was written around the time Al Smith was running for president and appealed to the nativist, anti-Catholic prejudices of upstate New York and America at that time.
While there really were gangs in that era, most of New York's immigrants were busy building hospitals and schools like St. Vincent's, Fordham, St. John's, Manhattan and Manhattanville.
The vast majority of the city's population including its immigrants didn't riot in 1863.
In fact New York City's 200,000 soldiers and sailors, more than half of whom were immigrants, won over 100+ Medals of Honor during America's Civil War.
It's a tribute to the persistence of prejudice that this book isn't more widely recognized as the nasty practical joke that it is
There is no doubt in my mind that Josh Harris is a good person, who sincerely wants to help people, particularly young Christian women, who are especially affected by the vicissitudes of the modern dating scene.
However, he doesn't seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular.
Either he's guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant: inexcusable in either case, considering how influential this book has become.
Is it because it offers the best possible advice on how to navigate the most clear and direct path from singleness to marriage?
No.
For the vast majority of singles, the approach described in this book will be too rigid and contrived to be workable.
Few couples have actually gotten together this way.
The real reason why this book, with its overwhelmingly female readership, has sold so well comes down to one main reason: there is a SEVERE SHORTAGE OF SINGLE CHRISTIAN MEN, as documented in CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com male/female ratios, and the Barna Research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the MILLIONS.
Christianity Today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that "rises to the top" for Christian singles.
Because Christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from "God's plan" for their lives, many of the surplus women faithfully avoid doing the math, but certainly feel the lack of male attention.
Unfortunately, this often gets boiled down to some kind of "passive Christian guy thing", but it probably has more to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women: which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage, whether it's New York City, Post-war Russia or your local mega-church.
It's not so much a lack of male leadership, but a lack of males.
And so the idea of courtship appeals to the romantic longings of single Christian women frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of initiative taken by single Christian men, who they greatly outnumber.
Since reading Christian books about relationships can be as titilating as any romance novel, many of these women will pour over every detail looking for the one piece of advice, the one thing they can change about themselves that will make a difference.
Which means they stay on the spiritual self-improvement treadmill, fuelling a Christian singleness industry with its own slogan "The Gift of Singleness" that refuses to tell them the truth about the Christian man shortage that is the greatest cause of their prolonged singleness!
Of course, their lack of contentment (an innate response that tells you that things don't add up) is something they are told to repent, ironically by pundits who themselves will not repent of how they profit from this symbiotic relationship.
But as long as these women can be convinced that their discontent is caused not by unnaturally protracted singleness that's the result of the Christian man shortage but their by own spiritual failings, there'll always be a market for Christian self-help books like this one.
Pure genius!
What's more, there are "unintended consequences" that can go along with Harris' model for "courtship" that he doesn't really address: 1) Because all masculine initiative taking must be based on a guy's intention to marry the woman, it makes asking a woman to do anything a BIG DEAL to him.
This can have several sub-consequences: (a) It creates a lot of anxiety for guys in terms of their decision-making and rejection-risk (getting turned down for a date is bad enough, but imagine having your "potential marriage proposal" crash and burn!)
(b) It fosters prolonged crushes, as stakes get so high with the guy investing all kinds of time and energy in figuring out that this is "the one", he might not ever do it (c) Ironically, it can boost up the guy's expectations in terms of a woman's looks.
Because the guy has to have everything worked out in their heads (that yes, this is the kind of woman I want to marry) lot of guys end up not bothering to spend time with girls who don't LOOK like whatever their "wife prototype" might be.
Guys who date and don't make a big deal of "a date" are more likely to ask out women they never thought of marrying and possibly end up getting married anyways (In "How to Get a Date Worth Keeping", Henry Cloud explains how couples will admit that their spouses weren't really "their type" when they first met).
2) It keeps people from the humbling reality check that dating provides.
Serial dating (as practiced in Latin American countries, where a guy will ask out tons of women, get turned down by most of them until he has a "short-list") teaches you where you stand with the opposite sex.
You ask your way down your "ladder of options" until you find your equal (likewise for women, in terms of dealing with the facts about who's asking and who's not).
With courtship, a man or woman can nurse an untested prototype of what they want in their heads for years.
The idea that it's better not to have any previous flames to compare them to is FALSE.
You're better off being compared to their last girlfriend/boyfriend (a real human being with chunky thighs and all) than with the evangelical Angelica Jolie/Brad Pitt that has filled their imaginations since adolescence!
3) It reduces interactive opportunities that promote the acquisition of social skills needed in a romantic context with the opposite sex.
It reinforces the pattern of psycho-social-sexual immaturity you commonly see in Christian singles circles.
4) It's unfair to the woman to have some guy spring a potential marriage proposal (which is essentially what courtship is) on her without any prior notice that the guy (who's had a head start on working out his feelings) is romantically interested.
Most Christian women seem to need some time to progressively get used to the idea of having a date with most of the guys who would realistically ask them, let alone entertain the thought of marriage.
5) It also heightens the significance of anything the men do when interacting with the women in their circle, who inevitably end up reading too much into their behavior and expecting too much whenever any nuance of interest gets expressed by a someone they like.
Kind of like, "he's a nice, sincere, Christian guy and he wouldn't be spending this kind of time with me if he didn't think of me as marriage material, right?
"...not always so.
If we are to stand back and take a look at it, the whole courtship redux really hasn't gotten off the ground: it works for too few people at this time.
Maybe the world has changed too much, or perhaps there are other issues today's Christian singles face in the mating game that need to be dealt with first: such as the confusion about "the gift of singleness" and the shortage of men.
I would recommend Debbie Maken's Getting Serious about Getting Married: Rethinking the Gift of Singleness for an alternative view of courtship that embraces the ordinariness and universality of marriage, instead of this moldy oldy.
Turning Angel was a page turner for me so I bought BLood Memory.
WOW!
It did not disappoint me
If you are going to read only one of Virginia Woolf's many works, this is the one to read.
She is the greatest novelist, but her novels cannot be equal, some being better or more universal than others.
She really *arrives* in this one.
I first read it twenty years ago in college, but I still think of phrases, thoughts, and concepts from this book.
The novel's themes resonate the way poetry does.
Worth the reputation.
I hope no one ever tries to make a movie out of this one
Until very recently the subject of animal awareness has not even been approached with the correct questions.
As Rogers clearly points out, most of the research on cognition has been directed at supporting the assumption that consciousness is an exclusively human phenomenon.
An inherited predisposition to preserve a human monopoly on consciousness survives only because it appeases our omnivorous behaviors.
In the early 1600's Spinoza correctly determined the existence of an emotional balance.
He told us that one extreme emotion will dominate the senses until such time that an equally extreme opposite emotion brings us back to emotional center.
Antonio Damasio provides a compelling case that consciousness is inextricably linked to emotion in his book "The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness".
Using Damasio and Spinoza as a frame of reference it follows that each and every decision we make is based on an emotion, not a uniquely quantifiable language infused thought, as the popular human interpretation might assume.
Examples of this might be choosing the color of paint, a selection from a menu, the selection of a mate or which way to turn when unsure.
Animals have provided us with an exhaustive and document able list of emotional behaviors.
How is it possible to arrive at the conclusion that animals are not conscious when most animals will clearly display behaviors consistent with emotional stimulus?
The last frontier of computer science is the quest for a conscious, non-human entity.
Ray Kurzweil has spent the better part of his life predicting the emergence of an exponentially accelerating form of machine augmented human consciousness.
In my view, it would be safer to assume that at some point technology will provide us with means to understand the different levels of consciousness that exist.
While computers struggle to redefine consciousness by passing "Turing Tests", visionary ethologists might find ways to interpret the world through different eyes.
It is exceedingly difficult to discuss the subject of animal consciousness from the point of view of the animal and avoid emotional interpretations.
Lesley Rogers has given us a glimpse of this vast subject by asking the correct questions and, providing the current objective answers from each available vantage point.
At a disciplined two hundred pages the book stands out as a concise introduction to the subject of Animal Cognition.
As an overweight, stressed-out, 40-something professional, I am thrilled to find this book!
The SPARK is exactly what I needed to get my body moving again.
I am one of those who had fallen for the 1-hour a day exercise trap, and if I didn't have an hour, which I usually don't, I just didn't exercise.
I love doing my three to four SPARKS a day, knowing I am doing my body far more good than waiting for that elusive day when I can fit in 45 minutes or more for my workout.
This is a wonderful concept, and so doable!
It's working!!
Thank you
Some previous reviewers have complained about the complex style and writing of this book.
Although in fact it is not an easily readable book, for the general public, if you have a serious interest about the history of the third Reich, make no mistake: you will not be able to overlook this book, which will surely be a classic.
It is a thoroughly well researched contribution about the connection between religious beliefs and mass fanaticism; the interaction between the "new" domestic and international values, based on aggression; and the other causes involved in the rise (and fall) of the III Reich.
From a different perspective from other mainstream historians, this winner of the Samuel Johnson prize for non fiction, has accomplished quite an original scholarly feat, one which will enlighten the comprehension of this particular period of history.
No wonder many international critics have found the subtitle of this opus -A new History- particularly well deserved.
Of great interest is the chapter related with the demise of the rule of law, a thorough analysis of the penetration of the judiciary and the subordination of the police and government to the totalitarian Fuhrerprinzip
When I started reading this book, I was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically-correct word choice.
Unfortunately, I did not find it to be particularly clever or funny.
On some level, it seems like the PC craze has subsided since the mid-90's when the book was written, and it just doesn't read as the brilliant critique that I expected.
We've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix "challenged" that it just isn't funny anymore.
I suppose that this book worked much better when it was written, but it hasn't aged well over the ten years since
The advice seems to be good advice to use in any relationship.
You also have to know your own situation very well and know when not to use his advice.
My ex would feel crowded if I sent her a bunch of sweet cards like the book says to do and would feel like I was trying to manipulate her, therefore I took it easy on the cards.
My ex may never get back with me because we are long distance but I feel I am loving her much better than before because of this book even if she doesn't realize it.
Remember to NEVER tell your lover that you read this book, especially if he/she is nervous about being manipulated
I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea.
From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time.
I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag.
I loved it, couldn't be more happy.
Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book.
It looked better than I ever imagined.
With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism.
I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects.
Maybe some firework sound effects.
Boy was I wrong.
I opened the book only to the colors black and white.
No red.
No blue.
No stars and stripes.
I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags.
I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.
At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression.
I nearly committed suicide at several points.
It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.
I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into.
There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.
I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes.
I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.
The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.
We found some very good books and they did cheer me up.
The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II."
Its published by a small church in Texas.
I was very proud of my students for finding it.
It has brought countless joy to my life.
Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag.
I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck.
I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely.
People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.
Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling.
If you haven't read anything on e-commerce at all, or if you're a total newbie, the latter half of this book may offer some useful advice on how to start an online business.
For someone who is already in the business or has already done some research, this book merely repeats a lot of well-known tips.
Even then, some of the tips, like in section on affiliate programs, are just theoretical assumptions and projections with very little practical information on how to actually attract sales and traffic.
As for the first part of the book where Allen demonstrates how he could earn $24k in one day, I find it totally unrealistic and it certainly won't happen to anyone reading the book unless he has Robert Allen's background to begin with.
Even then, this sort of strategy won't cut it with today's wise and cynical netizens anymore.
Jiraishin is completely new cop drama.
There's no extremely humane hero.And no beauty as his partner.
But I felt a lot of touching emotions by this.It's really interesting
I picked up this book hoping to fall asleep reading.
Instead I was drawn in by page 3 and stayed up until I'd read most of it.
The main character, in my opinion, is Janet, the mother.
I think it's more or less in her voice, and that is why she is the most developed character.
The book was very funny in an "Oh no!"
kind of way.
Sure, there are some outrageous stories and some things may seem unlikely to some people.
They are lucky, I guess.
I, for one, can really relate to the dysfunctional family and to a lot of the characters.
But it isn't meant to be a character study or some huge philosophy assignment.
It's meant to entertain you while you pass some time reading, and it does that just fine
I'm a fan of Bill Myers work and have been since "Blood of Heaven".
This one slipped by me somehow and when I saw it I immediately got it.
While the plot is somewhat tight for the most part, I do have some problems with parts of it.
For one thing, the thought of a terrorist who will kill someone very close to him (read the book to find out) shouldn't have any qualms about killing millions of others.
So why is he so intent on the stones?
But the most annoying part of the book is the fact that people call each other by their names so much that it gets old.
The minute anything happens, they're all screaming each other's names in the midst of the chaos until you finally just want them to shut up and get on with it.
For the first-time emergency, we can live with it...but when something happens every few chapters, you've got to have a break!
"Daniel!"
"Tyler!"
"Helen!"
"Tyler!"
"Daniel!"
"Dad!"
"Helen!"
"Tyler!"
Give me a break!
Otherwise, a good story...though not up to the same level as "Threshold" or "Blood of Heaven" (definitely better than "Eli" though).

Few works survive two and a half thousand years and remain a masterpiece.
This is one of them.
Thucydides crisp account of the long struggle that brought disaster to his native Athens is remarkable for it's candor, despite events that must have been tragically painful.
The text includes legendary personalities (Pericles, Alcibiades, Demosthenes, Nicias, etc): their actions, words, and fate.
Facts license readers to decide what's important, and the events described are worthy of discerning the essence of humanity.
Who would have thought the promise of Persian defeat (told by Herodotus) would be squandered in a tedious contest that ultimately proved grave for all involved?
Athens' distinction as the first democracy makes it a vital epic (given recent attempts to democratize the Middle East).
Melos destiny at Athens' hands may give pause.
As may the Syracuse expedition (especially Book Seven).
I read Warner's translation thirty years ago (it was 50p then), and still turn to it from time to time.
Also recommended: `The Landmark Thucydides' (Robert Strassler, Victor Davis Hanson).
This is a volume for those willing to spend a bit more to obtain the history matched with maps and footnotes
Another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation...
If you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...Unfortunately they don't come with disclaimers.
like one would get when reading a book on the occult... People tend to go for books that support their bigoted view, and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it....
It is a living.
When the Da Vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot's guide to the code, how to interpret the code etc etc....
I am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the NY times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad...
I am a longtime Jance fan and wasn't disappointed with Dead Wrong.
Any complaints would be the overemphasis on Joanna's pregnancy with a concomitant under-emphasis on tension and suspense (great ending, though!).
Butch is effectively out of the way in this installment as he promotes his book, but also comes across as overly self-absorbed, especially when his obnoxious parents show up and his wife is poised to deliver their child.
Jenny, too has little to add to the story.
But Joanna shines, as usual.
Nice to see such a reliable, ethical, and strong female protagonist
After having read and loved Howard Pyle's 1968 Classic Press edition of "The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood" I was quite disappointed with "The Story of King Arthur and His Knights".
Whereas Pyle brilliantly brought his characters to life in "Robin Hood", the characters of "King Arthur" seem flat and lifeless by comparison.
The King Arthur stories read like little more than a description of events; one doesn't really get a feeling of being there while things are happening as in "Robin Hood."
The dialogue seems much more realistic in "Robin Hood", but I think there's more to it.
The writing style in "King Arthur" I'd characterize as prosaic---in sharp contrast to the charming, poetic style of writing in "Robin Hood."
The biblical and creator references in this book are overwhelming.
I thought I was buying a book about knitting, but found the references too distracting to be able to focus on her knitting instructions.
This is one of Nora Roberts' best books ever!
I have read everything she's written and this is now my all time favorite.
I ADORE this book.
The characters are interesting and very human, the plot is gripping and the background fascinating.
Callie, an archeologist, comes to a little town in Maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband.
What I really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment, like most romances (including Roberts).
Definitely a book I highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot.
It will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are
Ayelet Waldman is a graduate of Harvard Law School, so I assume she's an intelligent woman and a good lawyer.
She should stick to what she knows.
The fact that she's married to a famous author doesn't make her a writer.
Her novel is poorly written, overly sentimental and, to put it bluntly, very dumb.
What's next?
Padma Lakshmi writing a novel because she's married to Salman Rushdie?
This is another collection of Barry's columns and a surefire hit for any fan.
As usual, his columns pack a punch and end with a zinger or inside joke.
Mr.
Language Person makes an appearance or two in this collection, and Barry also takes on TV commericials, his relationship with his wife, and (always a winner) the life of his teenaged son.

The plot is stronger than Dick and Jane, not quite at the Dr. Seuss level.
But my 4-year-old loves the thing.
He wants to read it - what more can one ask for a first reader than self-motivation?
Good illustrations, basic vocabulary, frequent repetition, and not scary
This entry in the Fang Mulheisen series came as a surprise.
It was closer to something by Elmore Leonard or even Carl Hiaassen.
Great, engaging characters, funny dialogue and an excellent plot
Not sure this is the book to study for the PMP.
Agree that its missing the tools techniques and concepts but he made it clear up front he was not going into it.
Also, the intergration knowledge area is missing.
I think if he went into the format of the exam , it would really serve its purpose better.
Read this after you have read the PMBOK and another REAL PMP EXAM prep book!
This is great to read the day before for leisure with no pressure
I am a professional photographer, and I was looking for a book on lighting technique - which this book supplied excellently.
Their step by step approach is easy to follow and understand, and all explainations have images attached so you can see what they are talking about.
They slowly build your general knowledge on how light works rather than supplying specific lighting diagrams, allowing (and suggesting that you do) you to adapt the knowledge to your own use.
They then go into more detail with difficult lighting subjects such as metal, glass, and more, and how to deal with them.
My only complaint is that the book is starting to feel a little old, especially when they talk about colour.
It is almost exclusively film based with virtually no reference to digital technology.
If they were to do an updated version with more emphasis on lighting for digital, I would provide 5 stars
This book was advertised as though it would be valuable for any professional.
This is absolutely not the case.
This book covers very, very basic guidelines and does so in an overview type fashion.
I would recommend this book for college graduates or those who are employed at entry level jobs and are seeking advancement
This is the stupidest review I have read so far on this site.
The person who wrote it has no idea what they are talking about.
I seriously doubt they even considered reading the book.
(I haven't but I've been poor and I've been on welfare.)
You should know something about a subject before you spout off
I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time.
Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.
I give it a minus 1
I've been a Sendak junkie since I was a kid.
His books have always been among my very favorites, and I'm happy to say they're among my kids' favorites as well.
I also love pop-ups, so I was really excited to learn about this book.
And I must say, my expectations have been surpassed.
The story line is very simple: a young child looks for his Mommy, encountering various monsters along the way and defeating them in creative ways.
There are only a few written words in the book.
But the story that the pictures tell is wonderful.
What child wouldn't be delighted by a book in which a kid defeats the wolfman by pantsing him?
Nosferatu gets a binky!
And there's a ton of detail in the pictures as well.
My girls like to spend several minutes looking at each page spread.
Then there are the pop-ups.
This book is really a paper engineering marvel.
The pop-up bits are enormously detailed and full of movement.
My favorite part is when the boy unwraps the mummy.
It's an understatement to say the pop-ups are spectacular.
The only reservation at all I have about this book is that my kids will probably love it to death.
Like another reviewer, I think I'm going to buy them their own copy and keep one for myself!
If you have the least interest in Sendak or pop-ups, or think you might, buy this book
As a romantic comedy, Star Wars is a failure.
As a science fiction film, the Annie Hall is a complete disappointment.
Whatever other merits these movies might have, there are definitely areas that they are lacking.
Which brings me to The Rough Guide to Cult Movies: as a reference book, it is highly suspect.
What's notable is that Annie Hall fails as sci-fi because it doesn't try to be that genre; The Rough Guide fails at the very category it aspires to.
Which is too bad, because it is often an interesting read.
The failure starts at the beginning of the book with a definition of cult movies that is so broad as to be meaningless.
We then a series of chapters representing various "genres", some of which are valid (science fiction, westerns, horror), some of which are ridiculous (Animals, Food, Nuns) and some of which are not even true genres (dubbed, independent, straight-to-video).
After this, we get various miscellaneous topics that are thrown in without rhyme or reason, such as a list of top movie grosses followed by presidential movie trivia.
The movie descriptions are often amusing, although there are numerous errors (such as misstating Geoffrey Rush's role in Pirates of the Caribbean), even more omissions (every reader will find his own; one example is that Unforgiven is missing from Westerns) and plenty of movies that are really miscategorized but seem only placed in a specific genre to fill it out.
What saves this book is, even though it fails as a reference book, it is nonetheless entertaining.
I am therefore giving this two stars instead of one.
It's a rather useless book, especially if you want to learn more about movies, but if you do pick it up, it is probably the most entertaining two-star book that you're ever likely to read.
I enjoyed every chapter and I especially appreciated the author's hand drawn illustrations.
I also learned a lot about how forests develop and the importance of biological diversity.
I think that I will now see a lot more when I walk in forest.
Like the other reviewer, I feel inspired to acquire some acres of logged out land up North and let the forest grow
Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy?
How much would people pay for this service?
How far would they go to protect it?
What are the moral implications?
Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma.
Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved.
Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.
Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit.
In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets.
There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it.
Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real.
The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted.
Turn a page and the story just ends...what?
That's it?
Are you kidding?
Did Robin Cook really write this?
I don't think so.
...you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library.
If you want to get an "inside view" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!
What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style.
The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.
He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.
I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.
He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!
I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.
I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.
But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.
I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed..
This bool from the evil russian is useless if you already own " naked warrior " .Good techniques and informations nevertheless
I've always thought someone should do a retro coffee table book on A-frames.
Someone did.
It's perfect.
The book has a great cover in cool 60s colors.
Inside is a detailed history with pictures, illustrations and everything one would ever want to know about A-frames.
Thank you Chad Randl!
I enjoy this work, lots of fresh observations and connections.... but having read it in the light of recent trends in the e-biz world, it sounds thin and delusional...a lot like Tom Peters after way too much espresso.
There ARE consequences from CONTINUALLY embracing change...and, in my experience ALL of them are BAD.
I wonder on what real-world EXPERIENCE Mr. Kelly bases his thinking.
My advice, embrace chaos and change, but do it VERY CAREFULLY...because it will definitely have consequences.
Truth pppppppppp amp; Beauty!

A very disappointing book, and again, makes me very wary of any item on a "New York Times Best Seller List" or any other list, and really any big name reviewer recommendation.
This book has one 50 page chapter which is excellent - the recap of the Thompson "Shot heard around the world" homerun.
If you are a baseball fan as I am, that (barely) made the book worthwhile.
The other 700 pages are disjoint, incomprehensible, and really trivial.
You come away thinking "I really don't care bout this stuff" - I don't care about the dynamics of trash, about J Edgar Hoover's bathroom habits, Klara Sax's artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops, about characters that just don't have much depth to really care about.
At the end, even potentially interesting characters like Albert (the one on the baseball quest) become hard to bear.
The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home.
I read this book, as perhaps others did, expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld.
What I got was a book with a good first chapter, some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50's (fear of nuclear weapons, duck and cover classroom exercies), and a lot of knowledge about the trash business.
The "masterful" epilogue, as other reviewers call it, really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillo's ragtag story telling.
I am ok with stream of consciousness writing, or nonchronological chapters, or even random chapters, but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult.
Was this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us?
Or how each of us is on an individual quest?
Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80's were just years of fear, and the 90's are years of greed?
I am still unsure, I still don't think any of these themes came across well.
Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate, intellectual, or professional critic - but this book is really not worth the time or effort.
You can be staisfied by a number of other books, including the "The Corrections" by Franzen or "The Cold Six Thousand" by Ellroy which cover a similar period or similar themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end.
Read the first chapter, then put the book down or you will be sorely disappointed and have wasted an awful lot of time.
The book was excellent, as I knew it would be because I like the author, Wendell Berry.
And the service could not have been better: the book is in excellent condition (like new) and came in an amazingly short time
Would you like to bake Portugese Egg Tarts, Middle Eastern Pizzas with Lamb and Pine Nuts, Almond Milk Bread?

Or, if you are ready for a trip to Tibet, Wales, Syria, Brazil, France, and/or Italy--it's here, too.
Please enjoy this wonderful book--in the kitchen for those you care for, and on the couch with a cup of coffee--and one of these finished recipes, of course
There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).
If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.
This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".
If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.
Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here.
What a wonderful book this author has written.
It talks about developing interpersonal skills, public speaking skills, prospecting skills, networking etiquette, sales skills, marketing principles, and even customer service.
It mentions the power of the Thank You note, and of giving more than you receive.
It also devotes a chapter on some things about home-based businesses.
And a chapter about the opportunities available through network marketing, and also a chapter on mail order and direct marketing as a business opportunity.
I'm not sure the mail order chapter should have been included.
Quite frankly, I think the author should have written another book about what he discusses in chapters 12 to 14 instead of including those chapters here.
And I think Chapter 15 should have been saved for its own book, and not included in this book either.
But who cares!
Anybody interested in the main thrust of the book (endless referrals) is going to be interested in chapters 12 to 15 - and they are well written and informative.
What I liked the most about the book was the chapter summaries at the end of each chapter.
I did not have to wade through the book the first time through.
I just had to read the summaries.
The other thing that was really nice about the book was the "recommended reading" sections at the end of chapters 12 through 15 and the one at the end of the book.
Those booklists were very thorough and helpful.
5 stars
There is a Tarot correlation, but the deck also has a strong shapshifter orientation as well.
The cards are a piece of art in themselves.
The cards encourage a strong connection with nature.
The spreads give good results to those of an inquiring mind.
With a minimum of reading, you are off and running getting insights to the past, present, and future.
There is a wide variety of uses for the cards for self or with others
Sheppard's attempt to capture the "American youth angst" failed miserably.
Instead what he created was a novel that felt more like a chore to get through.
I never developed any connection or understanding of the characters.
Each chapter seemed to stumble into the next, with the end as predictable as the next expletive Sheppard was going to use to give his protagonists a hard edge.
You'd do better saving your money, driving to the nearest mall, and find the kid in the Anarchy T-shirt looking sullen, because it appears that is all Sheppard did in this work.
Phew Stinker-rooney!
Tapscott and Ticoll have written another very detailed, practical and profound book about business that shows their knack for zeroing in on the heart of a momentous change that is stirring in the world and explaining it all clearly and completely.
At the heart of The Naked Corporation is the notion that shareholders and other stakeholders are empowered by technology to know more and more about organizations faster and faster, which in turn greatly emboldens them to take action based on their new knowledge.
In other words, perhaps the old adage "there's one born every minute" needs updating.
They're still being born, but hopefully now only a few per hour?
Corporations "getting naked" can't be good news for marketing departments.
Their job can no longer be about creating a nice rosy image; companies and products must be the image - for real.
Yikes...David Brett, Founder, Knexa
I am so passionate about this book.
It has answered all the life questions I have ever held.
Although many people I have recommended it to have reported that they have not been able to "get into it" - for me, I would say it is the best book I have ever read.
This is about the 5th copy I have purchased because when I lend it out, somehow it is not returned and I want to have a copy to re-read every now and then.
(I will not be lending this one again
Really tried to like this book.
Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy.
Discursive scientific literalizations distract pppppppppp disorient.
Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow.
I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable
I enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts, but I didn't even make it through the first chapter before I put this book down in disgust.
Almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments.
As I was flipping through the book, I found x-rated pictures and drawings that I would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book.
I never would have bought this book if I had seen it in a bookstore, and I regret throwing it in the trash before I could see if I could get my money back
I stumbled across this book by accident at my library and decided what the heck, all those millions reading Gray's franchise can't be wrong.
Plus, I've seen Gray on Larry King once, and he seemed like a nice and reasonable enough guy.
This book, though, promising in its intro to be "sexy", touched more of my comical than my sensual nerves.
Now, I am not above accepting bedroom advice where it's warranted (for instance, it is thanks to Dr. Gray that I finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a huge fight caused by my criticizing a movie we'd just went to see).
But Gray's generalizations, dumbing down of most issues and sharing his own sex life with his wife Bonnie were mostly unhelpful, and I suspect that the passages I found funny were involuntarily so.
Although I'm the first to admit that women love compliments, Gray's suggestions, as displayed in several top 10-lists of things to say (and, occasionally, what not to say) were a tidbit too repetitive (ever wonder how many combinations you can play with the phrase "your breasts are wonderful"?
Read the book!).
Almost as enlightening was the hot tip on how, while getting to the undressing part, the man should pull the woman's panties "up her crack" (a.k.a.
give her a plain old wedgie--no joke).
And, don't miss the one where the Mongolian woman pulls a flag at full mast when she's in the mood and at half when she's not (or maybe it was different colors, I couldn't read clearly through my tears--no offense to the Mongolian people!).
More annoying were the recurring (and very stereotypical) assumptions that a woman always needs 10 or more times more cajoling into sex than a man (in various ways, be it foreplay, flowers or the favored seduction line hit lists), that a man always comes (and too quickly, of course), and that you need constantly innovative acrobatics in the bedroom, or your (otherwise mutually comfortable and sure-fire, I wonder?)
approach will become a "turn-off".
Bottom line (no pun intended): if you want some light and basic (!)
guidance, the book is not too terrible, but if it is "advanced bedroom skills" (Gray said that!)
that you're after, you're better off digging out that old Erica Jong or even any pulp.
The nature of a people is seldom easy to describe because the attempt is often sabotaged by either the Outsider's incorrect perceptions or the Insider's preconceptions, depending on which is constructing the definition.
What we find with W.J.
Cash's The Mind of the South is no different, although it is a pleasant journey.
Sparkling with some of the most fluid prose ever found in historical writing, Cash's work deserves recognition for this reason alone; yet there is value in the exposition itself, even if it forgets a full two-thirds of the South's population in its description (blacks and women).
What the modern reader is left with, then, is not so much a description of the "the southern mind" as it is "the white southern male mind."
And while Cash's work does not quite apologize for the many neuroses of that mind, it does attempt to explain the effects it has had on our perception of the American South, with a small dash of glory added for good measure.
First, it is important for us to take into account the wonderful introduction to the work by Bertram Wyatt-Brown.
Wyatt-Brown shows that Cash's battle with depression was a salient part in understanding his interpretation of the South, as was his upbringing.
Wyatt-Brown seems to agree with my assessment on the Insider/Outsider effect: "The origins of Cash's interpretation of his culture and region lay not only in the objective fact of Southern intransigence about issues of race and change, but in the very makeup of his mind.
Like so many creative depressives, he stood apart from the society around him.
Such a position of detachment can provide a special angle of vision that those immersed in society cannot obtain (Cash xxvii)."
Wyatt-Brown, with this statement, makes Cash an outside-Insider, by virtue of his being a manic depressive.
He is a southerner, and therefore capable of the same preconceptions of his own people as any southerner; however, according to Wyatt-Brown, by reason of his mental condition, he is elevated away from this status and into a new status altogether, a presumably better one.
I would agree with this, if the work itself is to be taken as proof.
Cash is capable of wonderful insights into his own culture and society.
However - and this is crucial!
- we must not gloss over the fact that by omitting women and blacks from his work, Cash loses some credibility.
It is here, it seems, that Cash could not escape the Insider mentality.
This work is characterized by one over-arching theme: southern culture, though as elusive in most respects as any other, is penetrated throughout with one defining and collective temperament.
In essence, this work is interpretative rather than linear, as it attempts to analyze rather than delineate.
This elevates Cash from the traditional historian (in the mold of Clement Eaton) to sociologist or social commentator (in the mold of David Halberstam).
That is not to say that Cash does not know his history or pilfers it from others; it seems impossible after reading The Mind of the South for one to imagine Cash using such smooth language while pulling facts from anywhere outside his own mind.
The disjointed quality usually apparent in any attempt to fuse sources without an overall voice is thankfully absent.
Cash is who we hear while we read, and it is his elucidative brush-strokes that paint the image of the Southerner.
Much is left out of this short review of Cash's work, as brevity is a consideration.
A more complex examination of the work would require many more words than I have time for at the moment.
But I do feel obligated to at least sum up the trajectory of Cash's masterpiece.
The first few chapters lay the groundwork for Cash's southern temperament - individualistic, violent, quasi-aristocratic, provincial, just to name a few - while the remainder of the work displays the evolution of that temperament while it is worked upon by forces both outside it and from within, and its own natural need to adapt.
The Yankee plays his part, as does Uncle Tom and the fugitive slave, the southern belle and the Garrison abolitionist, the carpet-bagger and the scalawag, the confederate soldier and the lynch mob, the fire-eater and the bible-thumping revivalist.
It is impossible for any society to exist in a vacuum, or as a prehistoric insect preserved in amber.
That being said, it is still remarkable that the American south came as close as it did
This is an integral desk reference for the reproductive health educator.
This text outlines all that there is to know to date about contraceptive methods and their function.
I don't inted to part with this until the 19th edition is released.
Joe Pickett's daily life is not as enjoyable as it once was.
His wife now has a successful business and brings home a lot more money than he does, and there's still the temptations both of them thought about while Joe was away at Jackson hanging over their marriage.
His relationship with his fast growing up daughter Sheridan is not what it once was and his new boss is doing everything he can to make Joe's life a misery.
Throw in a civil war between Saddlestring's largest family and the appearance of, after along term behind bars bloodthirsty J. W. Keeley, who will not stop at anything until he has avenged his daughter's (Joe's stepdaughter's) death through the slow and torturous murder of Joe Pickett, and one way or another the era of Saddlestring's game warden is set to end.
C.J.
Box's Joe Pickett adventures seem to very in style with each novel.
The initial Open Season was a surreal not quite but almost Carl Hiaasen type novel, then Savage Run turned the series into a more traditional thriller type of adventure.
Trophy Hunt introduced a very far fetched paranormal element into the series and as many, I was glad when Out of Range returned this series to the traditional believable realistic type thriller, a style which continues with In Plain Sight.
I would strongly suggest reading these books in order, starting with Open Season as parts of previous novels are given away in subsequent ones and In Plain Sight is certainly no exception to that.
It will be interesting to see if C.J.
Box continues with the characters of this series in some form or another or if his next book will be a totally different kind of adventure.
Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false.
On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as "isolated instances" and not planned nor calculated.
Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable
So you pick up this book and read on the back cover the exciting quote about Hemingway's ghost and you're ready to drop some cash, right?
Guess what--there's zero information about the Hemingway haunting in this book!
In addition, old Ataulfo of Madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic's version of Handel's Halleluja Chorus.
Instead, what's offered here is a rehash of old stories (and old theories about what ghosts could be) with insipid, comic book illustrations.
Why this is called a pppppppppp quot;field guide pppppppppp quot; with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon--be it birds, plants, or mushrooms--is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists.
If you're a serious researcher of this subject, then pass this book up and seek Hem's fetch elsewhere
On Nation, Underprivileged is a timely discussion of an issue that impacts us all.
In his book, Professor Rank carefully crafts a compassionate, analytical and innovative approach for addressing poverty in our country.
This is a must read for all (especially policy makers).
Ordinary Joy reminds you that God is in fact all around you in your ordinary living if you just take a break from all the hustle and bustle and truly appreciate His beauty.
Joe Campeau uses personal illustrations that we can relate to, and in turn, relates them to the teachings of Jesus.
On a personal note, my own faith has waivered for quite some time that after taking a "closer look," I am rediscovering God's presence in my life and I know that, no matter what, "the sun will shine tomorrow and I will be kissed by Son again and again and it can never be wiped away."
Peace and JOY
Gives many examples of Weapons, most of which are useful.
Gives no/few examples of Rings/Armours/Rods/Staffs/Shields Doesn't really think out a lot of the bonuses, also I question a lot of the penalties one has to take to use a Legacy weapon.
About the only table worth taking is 4-1, or 4-2.
Sure its a minus three to your saves, and a minus 2 to your attack power, and a whole SLEW of HP.
The rest of them are so painful they aren't worth taking.
Also all the caster "Tables" the ones your suppost to use if your a caster but losing caster levels and spell slots left and right doesn't make any sense.
No matter what feats and wizardry skills its not worth it.
Those could have been more thought out.
Also I question the fact that in some cases the lowest tables, A, D, and G. Seem to be a lot better than the B, E and H tables just from the way they interact with things.
I do fully agree that the top end capability you can add to your Legacy item is quite powerful, the I table is filled with many useful things the you wish you could have picked two of them.
What I wish/want was if they're was some way to trade lower level slots to get you the capacity to get two I table skills.
Also some way to get either more or less slots if you take a less dangerous or more dangerous tables of the legacy grid.
The rules for weapons and fighters/barbarians/paladins/rangers.
Are very well thought out and are very powerful.
Yet for anyone other class they need heavy modification to be workable.
In a Caster heavy campaign like the one I run and participate in its a very low value book
Sphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel.
This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read.
The story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson.
Johnson is a phycologist.
He travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the Pacific Ocean to help the Navy in a top secret misssion.
They quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship.
The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft.
They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations.
However on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave.
The team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean.
After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth.
This novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have, but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis.
I would strongly recommend this book
Hart disputes O'Reilly's claim that the US "gives far and away more tax money for foreign coutries than anyone else....." by countering that per capita the U.S. is near the bottom of the list.
O'Reilly wasn't quoted as saying "more tax money per capita".
More goofy reasoning by someone who ought to know better.
Wells wrote The Time Machine (1895) rather furiously; it seems the author was short of money and exploited his idea of future time travel, summing it up in a tightly constructed, very short novel.
Most works that I have read from the nineteenth century are long-winded, purple-toned, velvet-like effluviums.
This one is short and for once I would have liked a book a bit wordier.
Anyhow, the narrator, a sort of mad tinkerer, describes his visit 800,000+ years to the future.
He finds two distinct inheritors of the human race: one smallish, simple-minded but joyful class of vegetarian people that live on the surface of the Earth (the Eloi), and one larger brute-like class of photophobic ground dwellers that perform most of the work for the Eloi, but unfortunately also eat them.
Gone are most of the trappings of modern society.
Humans have devolved into beautiful idiots and those that prey upon them.
Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection were just beginning to take hold at the time Wells was writing and they obviously influence the work.
I read somewhere that Wells took a university course taught by the biologist T.H.
Huxley, who highly regarded Darwin's theories.
Socialism also influences the book, with the Morlock underclass literally kept in the dark until they devolve into creatures that cannot tolerate light and have to rely on human flesh for food.
Part of socialist theory is conflict theory; so instead of cannibalizing their own, the Morlocks eat the Eloi as a sort of vengeance.
Darkness, and the use of the dark as something mysterious from out which monsters may jump, is Gothic old hat for early writers of this genre.
Wells uses the dark as the place where the Morlocks are banished, and where the Time-traveler believes the Morlocks have his stolen time machine.
We feel the Gothic fear when he knows he has to go down there to attempt to get it back.
Also, I wouldn't say Wells is the first to blend science with fiction either; see Hawthorne's "Rappaccini's Daughter", Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Edgar Allan Poe.
And is there something unsettling about the Time-traveler's undertaking with the childlike Weena?
Her death at the hands of the Morlocks is tragic, but imagine the circus-spectacle she would make if the narrator brought her back to his time as he intended
I have read all of Van Gulik's murder mysteries and this is has to be my favorite.
The characters are intriguing and some sinister.
The end is satisfying and bittersweet, challenging integrity vs justice.
I would, however, recommend you read the others first (chronological is good, Chinese Gold Murders is first) to get to know the main characters although this book can stand on on its own
I was lured into reading Under the Volcano after seeing its inclusion on the Modern Library's One Hundred Best of the 20th Century and after reading a reviewer compare it to James Joyce (I am an amateur Joycean who tries to read Ulysess, Portrait of the Artist, and Dubliners at least annually).
Lowry has nothing that likens him to Joyce.
This book is leaden and tedious.
I forced myself to finish it because I hate to start a book and not finish it.
But it was no labor of love.
It was simply a labor.
I ALREADY HAVE THIS BOOK AND I AM NOW BUYING FOR FRIENDS.
IT DOES SPEAK TO ALL AGE GROUPS AND IS MAGNIFYING TO THOSE OF US GALS WHO GREW UP IN THE SAME TIME.

I THANK HER FOR THAT, BUT I WON'T ASK FOR ROYALTIES
A book on the theme of having the courage to deepen family ties.
That's a good theme.
However, the author can't leave well enough alone.
He really goes after people without kids as though they all, regardless of their circumstances, remind him of his former self: someone with too much cynicism and cowardice to raise a family even though that's obviously the "only" way to become a complete person.
Each chapter introduces a family and a crisis.
The people, who range from southern Americans to Turkish Muslims to Protestant Irish in Belfast, are terrific.
But the author goes off the deep end on page 47: "Now there are cities full of professional women and men who wholeheartedly echo this feeling [not wanting children].
They go around saying things like I'm too selfish to be a mother, or I'm not a baby person, or my favorite, I love my life too much to do that to it.
A friend of mine calls them the Petrified Forest - people who would freeze their life in time if they could.
'Manhattan's turning into a Petrified Forest,' my friend mocked.
I [Bronson] winced when she said this, because I used to be one of them.
When the Petrified Forest imagines parenthood, their hearts are flooded with the feeling of doors closing, not opening ...
In our society today, parenthood is on trial."
Well, hardly.
Bronson is making a lot of assumptions about childless people.
Everyone doesn't need to have a baby just because Bronson found it a refreshing alternative to preserving his immaturity.
I'm all for individuals pursuing the particular life that makes them happy, but they should never push their specific solution upon the rest of us.
In conclusion, read this book if you want to, but be aware of the bias.
After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books, reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring I guess this is where the adventure end for me..
An outstanding, conceptually challenging, classic exploration of the ontology of art.
It may be daunting at first, but once you become accustomed to the level of abstraction of the text, it is extremely rewarding
This story was about a young brother trying to make it in life.
I have to admit that I was excited to read this book, and it let me down.
I didn't like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him.
I don't think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a "Do Right Man" at all, but rather a wimp.
During the first half of the book, I waited for him to get a back bone, which he never did.
From there on the whole story was slow.
I was bored about continually reading about him and his radio job.
This was a slow read for me, I skipped a few chapters just so I could find out what finally happened in the end
Like most great diplomatic moments, successes and failures alike, decades will pass before anything approaching a full history of the Camp David debacle can appear.
Even then, disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after.
Given the wide interest in the Israeli-Arab conflict and the complex nature of the negotiations, new works exploring the crucial climax at Camp David remain welcome.
Some dismiss Mr. Swisher's work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team, but instead was responsible at Camp David only for negotiations.
That seems to me unfair.
Clayton Swisher clearly did considerable "leg work" to prepare this text; sadly both his rather obvious bias and almost juvenile desire to settle scores renders what could have been an important work at best suspect.
Mr. Swisher's book follows on the heels of Dennis Ross's interesting "The Missing Peace" and, given Mr. Ross's direct involvement in the negotiations; no one could be blamed for looking at other works as well.
However, Mr. Swisher spends much of his time looking to lay the blame at Mr. Ross's feet, even when he makes claims that others at Camp David, many more central then Mr. Swisher directly contradict his statements.
Much for example is made in this work of Mr. Ross's change of "municipal Jerusalem" to "greater Jerusalem" in a draft as if this caused the breakdown of the agreement.
Unfortunately, Ross's change in fact was a return to an earlier draft after being changed by Robert Malley, a member of the US team and now often a talking head representing the Palestinian point of view, who made the alteration without consulting any of the parties.
Malley has never denied this.
Moreover, days would pass before the negotiations actually broke down.
Swisher's target, perhaps seeking to sell books by putting forward a contradictory point of view, shifts the blame wherever he can to Israel and the US negotiating team.
While such an effort might well be reasonable, Mr. Swisher often twists facts, making excuses for Palestinian gaffs while blowing minor facts out of all proportion.
For example, Mr. Swisher brushes aside the days lost when Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian team insisted that Jews had no historic link to Jerusalem or the Temple Mound -- a position farcical on its face -- as mere posturing.
However, he never mentions that such ideas, undermining the Jewish people very claim to the Land, serve only to inflame the parties and make agreement almost impossible.
Nor does Swisher ever consider the Palestinians failure to negotiate in good faith, treating every Israeli offer simply as a new base line, rather than offering any proposals of their own.
Again, even Robert Malley concedes that this disingenuous strategy by the Palestinians likely doomed Camp David from the start.
Swisher's dismissal of all Israeli concerns reaches a crescendo when he simply casts aside as silly Israel's interest and the Palestinian's refusal of any compromise for the so-called "right of return," or the claim that all Palestinian who left the area of modern Israel and all their descendants must have a right immigrate to Israel, a right held by no other people.
As to the simple fact that this would lead to the destruction of the Jewish State and that the Palestinians are thus expecting Israel to commit national suicide, on this problem Mr. Swisher remains silent.
Lastly, one cannot help but marvel at Mr. Swisher's odd coverage of the events after Camp David.
That Yasser Arafat led a bloody war against Israel rather than offering an alternative proposal for peace is dismissed.
Mr. Swisher combs through events searching for, magnifying, and twisting any event that will make Israel look bad, while at the same time minimizing or even ignoring the waves of suicide terrorists who have murdered hundreds of Israeli civilians in cold blood.
Mr. Swisher even parrots points of Palestinian propaganda so thoroughly disproved that even Palestinian leaders no longer mention them, such as the claim of massacres during Israeli operations in Jenin, which exhaustive study long ago proved to be nothing more than a fabrication.
Curiosity will cause readers to ask why Mr. Swisher takes this extremely biased view.
Fortunately, he lays out his rather simplistic point of view at the very beginning of the book by writing the following, "The primary reason for Arab and Muslim anger against America has been and remains unbridled support for Israel's oppression of the Palestinians."
Again, one can only muse as to why Mr. Swisher does not take Osama bin Laden at his word when he spoke shortly after 9/11 that his hatred manifests from the presence of American Christian soldiers in the heart of Islamic holy lands like Saudi Arabia and later Iraq.
Surely neither the bombings in Madrid or more recently in London had anything to do with Israel, but it seems for Mr. Swisher's simplistic world view, it is at the door step of the Jewish state where all blame is to be laid.
I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."
It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R.
Gray.
Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.
Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.
Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.
So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.
In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret.
There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.
Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?
Yes.
The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.
Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.
That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.
What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.
Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.
If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."
But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.
Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.
His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching
While it is true that Brandenburg is a tremendous photographer and the majority of photos are simply breathtaking.
I returned my copy because the datebook also contained disturbing photos of dead wildlife.
I'm very tender when it comes to wildlife, and while I know that death is a natural part of the life cycle, I am disturbed by dead wildlife and would never chose a book or datebook containing such pictures.
For anyone who is animal sensitive and dislikes any death photos, then this IS NOT the book for them.
Otherwise, I would recommend it
Michael Farquhar has created another bathroom book for the history-loving set.
This one, Treasury of Deception, is just what it's title implies and is broken down into categories and ranges from prison escapes to scientific frauds, from practical jokes to deadly hoaxes, such as the blood libel.
It is a truly odd mixed bag and should be read over a long period in many small bites, although that may prove harder to do than anticipated and one may find oneself gobbling the whole thing down at once.
The book is light at the right moments and more serious when required and, amazingly enough, never veers into the truly silly, which is a blessing
This is the worst, most depressing piece of fiction I have ever read.
There is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration--and after a while, their actions just become inexplicable.
The author's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book.
It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaiman's darkness or one of his minions.
Additionally, the characters' motivations change like the shifting sands, nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease.
What is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all.
Unlike some of Stephen King's work (ie: The Stand), there is absolutely no redeeming thread here--no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil.
It's evil in evil vs. evil surrounded by evil.
All I can say is that this book is ugly, ugly, ugly.
At least writers like Joyce Carol Oats and Joseph Conrad's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness, but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable.
The choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense--and you do root for him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all.
I suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as I could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence, I literally stopped mid-sentence and chose to never read this author's work again.
It's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist, Dave McKean, who maybe hasn't completely gone over to the dark side like Neil has.
His association with Dave McKean is the only reason I even opened-up the book--and maybe a little because the title intrigued me.
But it's unfortunate that the industry rewards "clever" works such as Mr. Gaiman's with undue praise.
I've never so strongly disliked a book.
Have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book?
Well, don't believe the hype, this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with X-men eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you
A WONDERFULLY TOLD CAT-TAIL!
THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE LOVELY AND APPROPRIATE TO THE PLAYFUL THEME OF THE BOOK
Don't get me wrong this was a really good book.
And I am so close to giving it 5 stars.
It was just a little too short for me.
The story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core.
The only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game.
You will fly through this book, it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it, even after that mild short coming I mentioned.
Just my opnion, I could be wrong
$24.95 is way too expensive for a book that is only 100 pages.
Other than that the content in the book is good
...you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library.
If you want to get an "inside view" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!
What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style.
The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.
He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.
I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.
He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!
I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.
I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.
But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.
I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed..
I grew up reading and rereading this book, as did all the five children in my family.
It's one of the very funniest books I know on the subject of families and their foibles.
Shirley Jackson is so well known for her more macabre and adult writing that people are usually skeptical when I recommend this for its outstandingly intelligent humor.
Once you read this you must also read Raising Demons, which is the sequel, and every bit as good, although much harder to find
In my opinion, besides "Beyond Bodybuilding", this book is the best "value for money" by Pavel so far.
Two hundred something pages are saturated with information.
Explanations on how and why are thorough and comprehensive.
Description of techniques of exercises are not missing the smallest detail.
Highly recommended for training freaks.
This is book is collection of Interviews by Noam Chomsky given before and after the attacks on the WTC.
I found this book a little too brief and would recommend to first time readers of this author to read some of his other work and then come to this particular book.
This book is nonetheless an Interesting view to take on the events that are discussed in it
This book was great in helping me identify the details of my SMLE III, including decypering all the symbols.
It also provided a nice history lesson on the rifle.
I would recommend for collectors, those who own one, or those that just have an interest in them
It still amazes me that anyone takes Gould seriously.
He is an admitted Marxist, and he allows his social beliefs to influence science.
That is not science.
Science is a dispasionate search for the truth.
I get the feeling reading this book that Gould doesn't like what the truth is, so he wants to shape the way we see the truth.
They used to do that in the middle ages when it started to look like the earth revolved around the sun.
Gould tries to claim that Samuel George Morton fudged his data on measuring skull sizes.
This is not true.
Morton conducted his tests with integrity, and only one error was found which actually benefited the measurements of a non-Caucasian group (Kevin McDonald, "Culture of Critique", 36).
General intelligence is not a "statistical artifact" as Gould wants to promote.
Gould or any other scientist who wants to take Darwin out of biological sciences should be viewed with extreme skepticism
This was a terrible disappointment.
More of a memoir than anything about book-collecting, it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was.
There seemed to be no context or fabric to the book.
There were, however, HUNDREDS of references to obscure authors, actors, film-writers, magazines and books.
There were pages at a time where I was completely lost because I had no idea about whom the author was speaking, but he wrote as if the person was well-known to the reader.
Baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in Australia, thence to Britain to the US and ending in France.
Again, there is no context.
He would flip from a reference to the obscure artist, to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book.
If viewed as a book about collecting books, you will not learn much.
If viewed as a memoir, there was little that was interesting about the author's life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions.
There were a very few nuggets about what makes a book valuable or diminishes its worth to a collector, but they were too few and far between.
If you could not tell by now, I can not see much reason to read this book.
I think Mr. Baxter flattered himself to think that either he or his collection would be of general interest
We love this book - Mom and Two Year old included!
Gerald the giraffe finds music that he loves and is able to dance like never before.
Fun text, colorful illustrations.
This is a book we have read over and over in our house.
Has a great message about finding the music that works for you.
I love it so much I bought a copy for our niece!
I agree with the other reviewers that the book is worth buying and excellent to give you new ideas for using crochet with knitting.
However, be warned that the sizing is fairly small.
All of the womens patterns are either size 36 inch or 40 inch FINISHED measurements except for one pattern which is 40.5 inches.
I found this book on my own before going to get my MBA and was always a bit embarrased to admit that I had learned more from this book than any other (it's design makes it look a bit elementary).
I was pleasantly surprised to see that my Finance professor at the MBA program (Babson - the #1 entrepreneurship program 11 years running) brought it out on the first day and said it was a "must" for any businessperson's library!
It is a fantastic resource - don't let the look fool you
I enjoyed Andy Kessler's book about finance (Wall St Meat) but this one is just silly.
It seems to show the wisdom of the old writer's saw about sticking with something you know about.
This book is like sitting in a bar listening to a drunken bore try to impress you with all the little bits and pieces he heard at a hospital that day.
I couldn't wait to get to the end so I could throw it out
The watercolors are beautiful, but more amazing than that is the way the stories are told.
Zen Shorts has really caught my kids.
Even my youngest, (7 years) who is drawn to all things panda, is requesting the stories again and again because they make her wonder.
There are some wonderful kid's books out there, but this is something special
Highly recommended!
The text is engaging and very informative.
Clear possibilities for implementation
I checked this book out of our local library when I was teaching a unit on "oceans" to my preschool class.
The children listened closely as the suspense built in this story and the surprise ending was wonderful.
The children understood the food chain concept and have asked me several times to "Read it again!"
It has also triggered a renewed interest in the children for using their own imaginations to create stories of their own creation.
I am ordering a copy for our own personal library.
This one is a keeper
While I found this book interesting and informative when it dwelled upon the personalities and contributions of the physicists who discovered and explored the field of quantum mechanics prior to WW2, I found two problems with the book as it entered the war.
First, it spent too much time, at least for me, on the details of minor episodes and players.
In this sense, I might have appreciated the treatment had I been a scholar researching the field - but I wasn't.
Hence, I often found the reading dull.
Second, I found Powers' ultimate thesis - that Heisenberg purposefully delayed the German atomic bomb program - unpersuasive.
It appeared to me that Powers often strained his interpretation of the facts to make them conform to his thesis.
For example, when reviewing Heisenberg's "Farm Hall" statement in August 1945 that two tons of U235 was required to make an atomic bomb, Powers suggests that because Heisenberg articulated the appropriate lesser amount a week later, and because he purportedly suggested at an earlier date that a bomb could be the size of a football, his "two ton" statement was a purposeful "error."
Equally persuasive, if not more, is the simple thought that Heisenberg did indeed grossly overestimate what was required, thereby prompting him to tell Speer in 1942 that a bomb was impractical.
This is not to say that Powers is necessarily wrong.
I simply believe that based on the facts he presents, the issue remains debatable
I loved this book.
I love it so much, I want to give copies to my sisters, my friends and to get my husband to read it.
The ideas seem so simple and straight forward, that when you read it, you say "of course, I can do that in my life."
Much of it covers identifying your goals, focusing on those and affirming that you can achieve them.
I found it very rational and not just wishful thinking.
I really like the exercises included in some chapters.
One exercise was to write a description of what would be a your perfect day.
He explains the purpose of each exercise and ask questions/gives direction for carrying it out.
It's the type of book that can be sampled and parts re-read at intervals to reinforce your efforts for a happier life
The Paleo Diet is based on an interesting premise- the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment.
It seems like a giant leap to assume our paleolithic ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat.
Animals in the wild do make sensible choices most of the time, because their decisions are instinctual.
Self-awareness creates a problem that doesn't exist for other animal behavior as it does for humans.
Sometimes we do things out of curiosity, or laziness, or false beliefs.
So, considering the erratic behavior of present-day humans, who is to say our paleolithic ancestors were any more intuitive about their nutritive needs?
Even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error, frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild.
The fact that wild foods are frequently much richer in nutrients than domestic foods does not mean that you must subscribe to a strict paleolithic diet to take advantage of this fact.
Rather, eat more wild-sourced food.
Just about anything edible from the wild will be a healthy food, unless the environment from which it comes is polluted- and that is a very real problem.
Meat is a very dodgy thing nowadays, not like it was in the pristine wilderness of the paleolithic era.
The Paleo diet would be a healthy thing if we were still in that world.
Now, we need to worry about heavy metals in fish flesh, and antibiotics and growth hormones in feedlot animals.
Beef will have some naturally occuring omega 3 if the animals were allowed to wander in a more or less natural fashion, as they did when the most commonly employed mechanism for animal control was the cowboy.
This is no longer true.
The average cut of meat in your supermarket is taken from a feedlot animal, fed the wrong food and in conditions unsanitary in the extreme.
Basing a diet on meat in this day and age can be dangerous.
You must choose your meat sources carefully.
Meat made from free-range animals raised on pesticide-free in a caring manner can be very hard to find.
I found Loren's rejection of all products of agricultural development a little too simple minded, and in some cases irresponsible.
There is nothing at all unhealthy about whole grain foods or legumes consumed in moderation, and significant weight loss could occur for most people if they ingested organic whole grains and legumes but conscientiously avoided only the major evil products of agriculture: high fructose corn syrup, trans-fatty acids, artifical sweeteners, uncleaned foods raised non-organically with pesticides and herbicides, and improperly raised food animals.
My main objection to the book is nearly one hundred pages (about half) of the book is dedicated to the spiel- convincing you this thing is real and valid and worth your time.
I think the forward to the book or perhaps the first chapter alone would have been sufficient for that purpose.
After a while you get the feeling Loren is trying too hard to sell this idea to you, and it really interferes with the flow of the book.
Further, a lot (but not all) of the studies cited show only marginal advantages of different aspects of this diet.
The claims that you will experience great weight loss and feel better than you ever have are quite nice to imagine, and peppered throughout the book.
But it's hard to believe with the less than overwhelming studies cited.
One last nitpick.
One great way to compensate for the lack of typical food taste enhancers like salt and sugar is the use of herbs and spices.
something very much like the paleo diet already exists as part of peasant cuisines around the world.
It's a pity the recipes included do not explore those, but instead offer somewhat watered down and uninspired fare instead.
Espscially asian cuisines frequently make due with alot of the ingredients that are ok on the paleo diet, and their interesting spices make it all the more entertaining.
I found the recipes far too traditional and western-centric.
In her latest book, Tracey Wood demystifies the process of teaching kids to read.
As parents, we've all been told that reading is critical to a child's success in school, in a future career and for pleasure and enrichment throughout a lifetime.
We feel a great deal of pressure to help our children achieve this important skill, but typically don't know how to go about it.
Tracey presents a refreshingly straightforward, step-by-step approach to teaching reading skills.
The book is chock-full of word lists, fun activities, games, and creative ideas to engage a child's interest and get him reading.
There are helpful book recommendations for readers of all levels (including parents!)
and pointers on spotting reading problems early, with practical suggestions for getting help.
The book is spiced with humorous anecdotes parents can truly appreciate.
Tracey's compassion and commonsense shine through and take the stress out of teaching kids to read.
I highly recommend this book to parents of beginning readers.
A Jules Vernes classic, this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time.
True, there are some items that may seem a bit dated, and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible.
Yet, this novel is still a joy to read.
With a stoic Icelander as their guide, a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the Arctic, as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist.
Contrary to popular belief (and scientific reality), the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth, which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno.
I won't serve as spoiler, but sufficed to say, that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth.
Vernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint.
Their instruments, a crude electric light and others, would be considered state-of-the art for their time.
Vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth.
Vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body.
And if you take Verne's theories to heart (although modern science refutes them), their journey is plausible.
However, I do have a couple minor gripes.
Vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations, which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel.
Although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist, the rest of the masses (myself included) probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line.
Also, there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with Vernes logic.
During their rapid ascent (the details I won't reveal), the adventurers would have surely perished from decompression sickness (a.k.a., "the bends").
Although it was still a new phenomena at the time, I believe Vernes should have taken into account the rapid change in pressure, as he did during their slow descent into the abyss.
The nitpicking aside, this is a superb novel that has withstood the test of time.
A modern reader will no doubt be entertained and enthralled at Verne's vision of a subterranean world.
Nearly a century and a half later, Vernes' works still inspire awe and imagination
This book is like a long short story that centers around Danny and a period that he is at Yale.
He and his friends are preparing for a big party.
The book goes on to follow Danny as he tries to start a relationship with Polly (who is sometimes on sometimes off in her relationship with one of her professors) while remembering about a local girl back home named Cindy who he kind of left in the lurch after they finally went all the way.
Just before Danny is ready to go home for spring break and work on his father's mobile lunchmobile, Cindy arrives at the school with a big surprise.
This changes Danny's view on things and makes him numb to the point that he even doesn't care when some toughs try to hone in on his father's lunch route and threaten him.
Danny goes back to school after the break and after resolving his issues with Cindy to attend the big bash that his friend Matt was planning at the beginning of the book.
This book like one of his later works, Little Children, shows Perrota's talent for creating intriguing characters in such short novels.
This book like the other seems to end too prematurely and definately screams out for a sequel!
Perrota is a super talented writer and I would love to seem him develop a much larger complete novel than leave the audience hanging at the end of another short one
This is the sixth book in the Left Behind series.
It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting.
It did not flow as well as the others, so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening.
The book also spends a lot of time re-telling what we read in previous books.
I felt this time like I read half a novel.
The book starts in the thirty-eighth month into the tribulation.
But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book.
Allowing their own desires to guide their actions.
Whether that desire be derived from rage, revenge, self pity, or even guilt.
Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ.
Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures.
And when the time comes for the assassination, there are a few characters to chose from.
The book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti-Christ.
Stay tuned for the next volume.
I have read this far, so I will finish the series.
Though most people my find this book suspensful, I did not
The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.
I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.
I mean Graceland for a first date?
I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.
None of them can talk in complete sentences.
And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.
There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it.
Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.
And I'm a big fan of Roberts.
I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.
But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.
I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out.
The use of an Integrated Development Environment [IDE] for a user to learn a language in, and to then program within, is well known.
Microsoft has made powerful IDEs for its languages.
And the open source Eclipse can be used for Java.
Along these lines, Ducasse offers his book.
It teaches Smalltalk using the Squeak IDE.
The twist is that Squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory, to convey the crucial concepts of objects/classes.
As Ducasse explains, Squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger.
So a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital, given her limited background and possibly limited attention span.
Squeak uses Smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language.
If you come from C++, Java or C#, you may be struck by its simplicity, compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages.
Which of course also makes it easier for a young student to learn Smalltalk or Squeak itself.
I wonder a little about the book itself, though.
A motivated high school student could easily use it.
But for some younger students?
In that situation, it may well be that the book could be best directed at a teacher, who can then instruct from it
McKnight's concerns about communities' dependency on professional assistance are legitimate, but disturbingly overstated in this book.
In the end I felt McKnight's trashing of the already well-trodden government provision of social services may not be altogether helpful to distressed communities.
He sidesteps concerns of capital mobility and exploitation and the pernicious effects wrought by years of discrimination.
Any debate over when and where and how social programs can be effective is cast aside as well, since in McKnight's picture, social programs and the professional service providers are, in fact, the vilains and culprits for most of what ails society.
One of the damaging fallacies that seems to be perpetuated in this book is that service professionals are not able to be both professional and caring - the two are deemed mutually incompatible.
Mcknights views resonate with employers' caring rhetoric - conveniently invoked every time a healthcare worker tries to claim she does care about patients but is still entitled to a living wage or, perhaps, health insurance.
What is further implied is that communities will readily and ably take up the reign of providing for themselves and their members when denied more institutionalized professional services.
It seems implied that communities had no problems before the social programs to solve them came into being.
In this, I think I see McKnight is invokeing an idealized notion of an society at an earlier time; maybe his argument would have seemed more reasoble in a time when families were less geographically mobile and may have constituted an economic unit, when the elderly lived shorter lives and were less numerous themselves with more children to care for them, and the local economic activities were more functionally interdependent.
But McKnight's model for today's cure doesn't seem to fit today's conditions.
On the other hand, McKnights solutions may be the only ones available in a society where budget cuts and elimination of social services seem the prevailing trend.
This is by far one of the least helpful parenting books I have read.
I used numerous suggestions in this book and NONE of them proved to be effective.
Using my own judgment and keeping calm with a positive attitude toward my toddler proved to be more effective then anything mentioned here.
His suggestions for head banging are completely stupid and made my toddler bang her head harder during a tantrum.
Not recommended
Although I have been writing code for a few years, this was my first foray into AI programming.
I find the examples easy to understand.
Everything is very well written and the example code is well documented.
I could not have asked for a better book.
I read this book, loved it, and now want to make a movie of it.
There is a local town that has a college, churches, and the overall atmosphere of the town.
I felt like I was reading about it while I was going through the book.
Hal Abelson is responsible for a famous epigram, "If I haven't seen as far as others, it is because giants were standing on my shoulders."
This book is solidly enough written, but it's a cut-down, shallow rehash of a few justly famous functional programming textbooks.
The first is Abelson and Sussman's "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"; the second, Bird and Wadler's "Introduction to Functional Programming".
If you want to really learn deep truths about programming, go buy those two books.
If they leave you scratching your head about how to transmogrify what you learn into Perl, buy Schwartz's "Perls of Wisdom"
This is a sci-fi novel about the end of the world.
Every single adult on the planet died.
THere are a couple of kids living in a house alone.
So begins the Fire-Us trilogy, fascinating, scary, and intriguing.
The story is really interesting - I mean slap in your face, give-me-more, I LOVE THIS intersting.
A couple of the images were really disturbing, though, like the fact that Hunter had to move the skeletons out of his way at the supermarket.
The kids in the story are fascinating, and the Teacher's scarpbook-thing was so .
.
.
wierd that it was actually kind of scary.
Then Angerman is introduced.
He's really messed up, but I get the idea that he knows something about the virus (Fire-us) that the others don't.
This makes him an amazing character, and even if you don't like the story its worth reading the sequel just to find out what happens to him and his battered dummy.
I really love this series, though some of the descriptions might be a little too much for younger readers.
Well worth anyone who is into sci-fi and apocalypse, as I was at the time.
P.S.
I read this book five months ago and I still remember all of the characters and their names and quirks.
Talk about powerful writing
Very disappointing and BORing!
NO likeable characters, VERY uninteresting story.
Could/Would not finish--too many "better" books waiting
This book provides a very interesting and informative detail of the history of birth culture in America as discovered through the study of birth chairs.
In incluedes intriguing pictorial documentations of birth chairs and how they evolved into the modern maternity beds in use today
This is the same old tired suggestions for cleaning up your clutter.
The suggestions given are to install custom made draws that double and triple pull out.
The suggestion for the pantry was to organize cans from little to big (duh) and then group like items together (duh) that's in every single organizing book published so this one is not different than any other.
Also the other suggestion was to install a pull out swinging triple door pantry system.
Oh is that affordable?
If I had $75,000 to redo my kitchen I would install the fancy garbage bin that pulls out of the cabinet and the double drawer pot rack with side lid bins.
Come on, don't waste your money on this book or it's suggestions.
Very few pictures and all for the rich.
I thought Good Housekeeping was for the everyday family.
Get it at the library and then return it after you don't read it.
Myth #1: American women live under patriarchy Myth # 2: America's the World's leading threat to the environment Myth # 3: America is a racist nation Myth # 4: The Untied States is an imperial power.
Myth # 5: The rich get richer, the poor get poorer ALL FACTS.
Plus, The higher the IQ the more liberal someone is.
Ben Franklin, Einstein, our founding forefathers like Thomas Jefferson...all liberals.
The lower the IQ the more conservative because it is easier to not think for yourself.
I love America, but changes need to be made.
Rome fell too eventually from bad politics
South by Java Head features fundamentals I find so promising: a nautical adventure set in Southeast Asia during World War II, written by a prominent screenwriter.
Nonetheless, the story falls flat and I found it just barely compelling enough to finish; the plot moves slowly, punctuated by one clumsily executed plot twist after another, the descriptions of action are confusing, and the characters mere outlines devoid of development.
I hoped this book would be as good as a 1950's nautical adventure i highly recommend, The Wreck of the Mary Deare, but unfortunately Java Head is just disappointment.
For other SE Asia World War II fiction, Clavell's King Rat is also a good place to start
I absolutely love Janet Evanovich and the Stephanie Plum series, so when I saw this new series of books with her name on it, I grabbed them up.
I couldn't even finish reading this book.
It was so bad.
The whole talking car concept was, frankly, just stupid.
This was like watching an episode of Knight Rider, but without David Hasselhoff.
The characters are flat, and the dialogue is stilted and contrived.
I can only believe that Charlotte Hughes did most of the writing, and why on earth would Evanovich attach her name to this?
Needless to say, I will not be reading the rest of the series.
Spend your money on something worth reading
