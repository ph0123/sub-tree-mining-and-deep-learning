Many novels of the African-American experience in the United States use the theme of "passing".
These novels generally involve a light-complexioned African-American who can "pass" for white.
Among other things, novels based on a theme of "passing" allow the character and the author to comment upon black-white relationships in the United States from both sides -- from the black experience and from the white experience.
Both white and black authors have made extensive use of the theme of "passing".
The earliest novel involving "passing" of which I am aware is by William Dean Howells in his short 1891 book, "An Imperative Duty" which dealt with an inter-racial marriage.
The African-American novelist Nella Larsen wrote a novel titled "Passing" set in the Harlem Renaissance.
More recently, Philip Roth's novel "The Human Stain" involves the story of Professor Coleman Silk, a distinguished academic and student of the classics who passes for many years as white.
Coleman Silk is the successor to the protagonist of James Weldon Johnson's only novel, "The Autobiography of an ex-colored Man" written in 1912.
The unnamed protagonist of the book is an individual, like Roth's character Coleman Silk, with great intellectual and artistic gifts who is torn between the opportunities open to him as an, apparently, white person and his strong sense of black identity.
Like Coleman Silk and the characters in most novels involving the theme of "passing", Johnson's protagonist marries a white woman and lives a life plagued with guilt regarding his abandonment of his heritage as an African-American.
Johnson's short novel is, to my mind, the best written on the theme of "passing", and it is a fine novel indeed.
The book initially was published anonymously.
The writing is so powerful and believable that many readers took the book for a true autobiography until Johnson acknowledged his authorship in 1914.
Many years later, Johnson wrote his own autobiography, titled "Along This Way" in part to show that the story of his own life was not the story of the protagonist in the "Autobiography".
Johnson's story shows how his protagonist goes back and forth, both internally and in the outward events of life, about whether to make his way in the white or in the black world.
He ultimately finds himself successful but unhappy.
In addition to the story line of the book, Johnson uses the "passing" theme to allow many reflective passages by characters in the book on racial relationships in the United States early in the 20th Century.
The most famous such scene occurs as the protagonist travels in a "smoking car" for whites on a train in the segregated South.
He participates in a discussion among several white men of varied backgrounds on the "race question" as it was viewed at the time.
There is also a chilling scene in the book involving a lynching, the burning alive of a black person.
Johnson worked fervently in the latter years of his life to secure the passage of anti-lynching legislation in Congress.
But Johnson's novel includes a great deal more than a consideration of race issues.
The book offers an outstanding picture of life in early twentieth Century America -- in the South and in Johnson's beloved New York City.
The book is filled with pictures of dives and gambling dens and of the trade of cigar making in both South and North.
It is filled with the love of the piano and of classical music.
Most strikingly, the book has the spirit and feel of ragtime, which reached the height of its popularity during the years in which the book appeared.
Johnson shows great appreciation for this product of American culture.
The book also illustrates some universal themes.
The protagonist is troubled, specifically, by the conflict between his identity as an African-American and his wish to succeed as a white person.
But the broader themes of the book are the consequences of lack of self-knowledge, the role of chance in human life, and the consequences of a certain sense of purposelessness and frustration, which plague many individuals separately from any consideration of race.
Johnson develops these themes eloquently and ties them in well with his theme of "passing".
Johnson's novel is an important work of American fiction which deserves to be read.
This book was stunning - I was enraptured with the writing and loved the story.
So many emotions in one book.
Looking forward to reading more from this author
I have never actually thrown a book across the room in frustration - and I love books, so this is drastic!
Spoilers ahead - please don't read on if you haven't read the book.
I managed to (somehow) get through the first book, 'Wideacre', which I disliked - whilst I adore the rest of Gregory's novels, so this was hard for me - and grit my teeth and tried to read this book, the sequel as I'd bought it and it looked more promising.
It was 'marginally better' as one reader put it, than the first, but a very depressing and frustrating book indeed.
I was getting very angry and frustrated after the second half of the book - as many other readers have highlighted, Julia's consistent inability to stand up to Richard made it impossible for me to like her anymore.
I quite honestly wanted to slap her to wake her up from that dreamy state she was in!
Because I wanted so much for Julia to be with James - who I liked a great deal.
I was so depressed after everything went wrong and she didn't marry him... ah, because I was expecting the usually very clever Ms Gregory to surprise me and have a twist at the end and say, aha!
She does get her true love in the end and she and Ralph get rid of Richard and although it's not happily ever after she learns to grow a backbone and be the very first female heir to Wideacre.
The rape scene with Julia and Richard was very violent and far too detailed and I think it may be difficult to stomach for anyone who has ever been in an abusive situation like that, in fact, for anyone at all.
I don't want to get into the tricky area of abortion too much, but I really did feel strongly that Julia should have gone to Ralph for help when she concieved the child with Richard.
This was a child of incest and rape - and she knew in her heart there should be no heir for Wideacre - they were all simply too inbred and it needed to end somewhere for nothing was going right.
Clean slate, so to speak.
Yet she gives the child away - then in her final letter asks James to find the child?!
What?!
And I was expecting perhaps a deformed child, after all this inbreeding (I mean this child is the product of parents who are brother and sister AND grandparents who are brother and sister!!!)
but she was perfect and beautiful.
I was hoping the gypsies would keep her and she'd never be found again.. but alas, the Lacey madness will live on...
The perfect end to this book would have been a nice twist.
Gregory could have made her very good point about inheritance rights and the lack of power women of Beatrice and Julia's era had by Richard being killed by Ralph, then Julia inheriting the land - baby Sarah is adopted out to the gypsies and never seen again and Julia either lives as a widow and runs the land or (this would have been lovely - I bet all the girls have sighed over James a little, didn't you?
he was a little like the handsome romantic leads in Austen's books) James forgave her - for they had both made mistakes and Julia's was not intentional nor her fault (I was practically screaming at her that it wasn't her fault - and she gets it in the end, when it's too late!)
and they marry and have 'normal' children - or perhaps none, they just learn from their mistakes and respect each other, and make a fresh start for Wideacre.
There were so many allies that Julia had - she was a sweet girl and I liked her - I wish that I could have shaken her though, I got so mad.
So many people in the village offered their help - this trap she was caught in with Richard could have been avoided - ahhh...
SO frustrating.
I will not be reading the third book in the series.
I shall go back to reading Gregory's more historic novels (A Constant Princess is one I haven't read yet and it sounds excellent).
I wouldn't recommend this one
The author, James Surowiecki, lays out and explores a variety of general and specific cases of groups of people acting either wisely or stupidly.
The examples are all easy to relate to, and I found them to raise meaningful questions in my mind which were answered in due course in the text.
When I think of crowds, I think of unthinking masses moving together, led by tradition, habit, or an individual.
How can that be wise?
A more accurate title would be "How some groups of people can make better decisions than experts, while others act like collective idiots, and what characteristics distinguish the two types of groups", although that's hardly likely to sell as many copies.
:-) For me this really shed some light on my past experiences of participating in successful and unsuccessful teams at work.
I'd sometimes wondered why I've been on a few teams that appeared to "click" (smart people who want to work together to achieve a common goal), but our results weren't great, whereas other teams have been successful.
What was it that made a good team?
I had some of the pieces, felt I still had some real gaps in my knowledge.
This book certainly helped.
To paraphrase the basic idea that I took away from the book, teams of people can achieve superior results if: 1 Each individual on the team is well informed; 2 The work of one individual does not influence the work of another; 3 There is an objective method to aggregate individual conclusions into a group conclusion.
As simple as they sound, there are many ways to fail, and the book does a great job of exploring a variety of phenomena that cause failure.
The Gospel of Judas has had its fifteen minutes of fame.
It is but another in an endlessly long line of stories or documents meant to shake the foundations of the Christian faith.
Like its many predecessors, it gave National Geographic and anti-Christian authors an opportunity to voice their dissension with the biblical story of Jesus.
A book titled The Gospel of Judas shot to near the top of the bestsellers lists and nearly as quickly, shot straight back down.
Still, while its popularity was short-lived, it allowed Bart Ehrman and other revisionists a chance to laud the epistle for its new insights into the life of Christ.
Surely Ehrman forever cast doubt upon his credibility as a historian when he blathered, "(The Gospel of Judas) is one of the greatest historical discoveries of the twentieth century.
It rivals the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Gnostic Gospels of Nag Hammadi."
National Geographic describes the importance of the document in this way: "The Gospel of Judas gives a different view of the relationship between Jesus and Judas, offering new insights into the disciple who betrayed Jesus.
Unlike the accounts in the canonical Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, in which Judas is portrayed as a reviled traitor, this newly discovered Gospel portrays Judas as acting at Jesus' request when he hands Jesus over to the authorities."
A classically dualistic, gnostic document, The Gospel of Judas presents a Jesus who is seeking to escape from the corruption of this physical world and asks Judas to betray Him so He can be free of this wickedness.
Judas complies and shows himself to be a hero, rather than a villain.
No longer the betrayer, He is a faithful friend to Jesus Christ.
Renowned New Testament scholar N.T.
Wright is the first Christian to my knowledge to write a thorough refutation of the teachings of The Gospel of Judas.
Judas and the Gospel of Jesus is due for publication in October of 2006 and will be published by Baker Books.
It is a short book, weighing in at only 144 pages, but provides a thorough treatment of the subject matter.
Wright is fair to this newly published document.
He does not say that there is no value in The Gospel of Judas for surely there is, for it tells us much about the gnosticism that was a great opponent of early Christianity.
It gives historians access to an authentic, original document.
But it tells us nothing about the real Jesus and the real Judas.
Those who would have us believe that this letter provides details about the real life of the real Jesus can be little more than revisionists.
Wright shows that such people believe in what he calls "the new myth of Christian origins."
This myth, popularized by men such as Bart Ehrman, has three main teachings: first, Jesus was not as the canonical gospels portray Him; second, there were a great many different varieties of early Christianity, and they produced a large number of different "gospels," all of which circulated among Christians more or less unchecked; third, when Christianity became consolidated in the fourth century, many teachings about the "true" Christian faith were rejected.
"Classic Christianity," he says, "has a lot more life and promise than have ever been imagined by those who propose the new Myth, or by those who offer newly discovered gnostic texts as the panacea for our ills.
It is a shame that the churches have been so muzzled, so often self-blinded to the full dimensions of the gospel they profess, the gospel of Jesus himself."
Through this short book, Wright asks good questions and insightfully shows where The Gospel of Judas simply cannot be held as equal in any way to Scripture.
He shows himself to be a New Testament scholar the equal of any involved in promoting this new gospel.
While the document appears to be genuine, it is little different and little more significant than the multitudes of other gnostic writings which have come down to us, even two millenia later.
It is perhaps somewhat ironic that N.T.
Wright, who has reimagined and reinvented many of the teachings of Paul (and thus Jesus), would be the first to make a stand for the truth against others who would seek to reinvent Jesus.
Unfortunately, Wright's New Perspectives are glimpsed, even if only dimly, through much of the text of this book.
Still, he offers a compelling response to Ehrman and others and one well worth reading.
I would tend to believe that, for most people, The Gospel of Judas is best ignored.
It offers little that would be of interest to the average person.
For those who do have interest in it, Judas and the Gospel of Jesus will no doubt prove an interesting response to the irrational views espoused by those who wish to reinvent Christianity and to cast doubt upon Scripture
i am a kindda new wife but struggling with learning how to grow up and not be a nag.
stormie is very easy to understand in her book and can relate to almost anyone.
like another person said i do feel like this book was written just for me.
the written prayers help me bc sometimes i dont know how to pray for my husband and this gives u the words to say and scripture to back up everything she says.
also, it helps me more importantly be a better wife.
this isnt a book to try to get ur way and mold and change ur husband.
i'd say its about giving urself up to The Lord to change u and make u a better wife .
and praying for ur husband is selfless and probably one of the most important things u could be doing.
i highly recommend this book, highly.
it changed me almost instantly!
i was more than willing to give None Dare Call It Treason a chance, as i found the scale of Stormer's research impressive.
However, the fact that none of his predictions concerning a massive Communist takeover in America came to pass, coupled with his outspoken admiration for McCarthy and truly insane predictions like this: "Once the takeover comes, you, like millions of others, who believe in God and man's responsibility for his own actions, can be slaughtered like diseased animals or worked to death in slave labor camps or brothels for the Red Army."
p. 20 have forced me to conclude that Stormer's thesis was overwhelmingly incorrect.
Perhaps the most irritating part of the book was his suggestion that the American educative system was hopelessly pro-Communist.
The fact that None Dare Call It Treason was distributed in American high school classes rather undermines his argument.
the sad thing is, because None Dare Call It Treason is so exhaustively researched, it is far too dry to be amusing, even when read ironically.
and ironic amusement is the only positive product of propaganda.
in closing, i would take Communism over John A. Stormer's America any day
While the Brooklyn Bridge is the oldest of the bridges crossing the East River, it's one of the strongest, sturdiest and will most likely outlast the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges.
John Roebling and his son, Washington, did not know how the forces of nature and bridge loads would affect their bridge.
Given this gap in their knowledge they overcompensated by building a bridge capable of withstanding forces many times greater than would ever be applied to their structure.
But the Roeblings' gaps in knowledge also worked against them.
One of the most interesting portions of the book is where McCullough discusses the pressurized caissons beneath the East River where Washington Roebling and many his workers spent their time.
Few doctors or engineers at the time knew how high pressure environments would affect the human body.
The quick changes in pressure killed workers and left many, including Washington, with a condition known as the bends.
Washington's wife, Emily, was forced to transform herself into chief engineer while Washington struggled with the bends.
There are lots of fascinating facts and tidbits throughout this book on the bridge and the people involved with its construction.
McCullough's book is much more about the politics and people behind Brooklyn Bridge rather than the engineering.
I would have preferred to read more about the engineering techniques, but I still found this book reasonably engaging.
Just finished reading this novel this morning and I think it is probably the weakest one of the lot.
Like a lot of reviewers, I didn't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well-developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the Stephanie Plum series.
As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date.
It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie's romantic situation once and for all.
I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me.
There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive.
I still think there is a spark of life in the Stephanie Plum series, but I hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by-the-numbers as this one
This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.
I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.
The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.
Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.
The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father.
I just did not find such an occurrence likely.
And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm.
Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years
My husband took the book out from the library for me and after reading the first few chapters I decided that this was a book to own.
As you will keep going back to re-read the roadmap to help you on your new venture(s).
Very insightful for all levels not just C-Level positions
This book is just plain stupid.
If it works for people and helps them lose weight I realize they will be estatic.
However, it is not healthy.
Each of our meals should be balanced.
These people are promoting unbalanced eating.
The reason so many of us are carb sensitive is because we have spent a lifetime over indulging on carbs!
If one were to sit down and eat each meal with balanced food groups, including complex carbs in small amounts, we would not only lose weight in a safe manner, but we would heal our bodies from the inside out.
This diet won't heal us, it is a fad.
If anyone is looking to really heal their metabolism, lose weight and even heal disease, try reading "The Schwarzbein Principle" by Diana Schwarzbein, MD.
That is a great book on how to heal diabetes, hypoglycemia, and many other things.
It also explains how eating balanced and giving up stimulants will not only help us lose weight, but reverse aging and stop having food cravings in the first place.
This book promotes eating unhealthy foods and is only about weight loss, not getting healthy.
In the post 9/11 world in which this book, subtitled "The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East" was published, it should not be surprising that the reader would anticipate a discussion of the factors that led up to that awful day.
This, however, is not to be found in What Went Wrong?
Instead we are treated to a cerebral discussion of various and sundry esoteric minutiae.
We learn, for instance, that, "A distinguishing characteristic of Western music is polyphony, by harmony or counterpoint.
This begins in its simplest form with the choir, in which matched voices sing different notes in a planned sequence to produce a combined effect; then comes the keyboard instrument, matching the ten fingers of the two hands, following different routes in a common purpose; and finally, the musical ensemble, from duets and trios to the full orchestra".
While this is all well and good, and may even be mildly interesting on some academic level, it is hard to understand how it plays into a discussion of "The Clash Between Islam and Modernity..." that has led to the precarious times in which we live.
Or, on another note (harmony?
counterpoint?)
we learn that Robinson Crusoe was translated into Arabic by Butrus al-Bustani and published in the late 1850's.
Big deal!
What we don't learn anything about is the rise of militant Islamism.
There is no mention of Wahhabism or how this fundamentalist Islamic movement contributed to the rejection of modernity.
The Muslim Brotherhood also is not to be found in the index, nor is there a mention of Sayyid Qutb, or his writing of the incendiary manifesto, Milestones.
Furthermore, there is not a single reference to al-Qaeda, though Usama bin Laden does appear, albeit seemingly as an afterthought, in what appears to be a hastily added Afterword.
So what went wrong?
Beats me..
I remove children from abusive parents daily.
Legally, you cannot hit your child with anything but your open hand on any area but your child's buttocks.
If a neighbor, friend, teacher or family member calls Child and Family Services because your child reports to them that you are doing what Dr. Dobson advocates, your child could be removed from your care.
Only my second James Patterson book, When the Wind Blows, will keep me coming back for more.
I was not disappointed and look forward to reading many more of his novels.
Frannie, a veterinarian, and Kit, an FBI agent find themselves thrown together in the hopes of saving a few very special children.
Surrounded by some mysterious deaths in the past few years, including her own husbands, Frannie now is trying to stop yet another murder.
It all begins when she thinks she sees a girl with wings in the forest near her home in Colorado.
From here we learn of genetic experiments and more heinous crimes than those.
This book was written prior to the much acclaimed and popular Lakehouse with many of the same characters.
You have to ask yourself, "Why did William Grimes think there was the need for another culinary dictionary?".
As you read the book, the answer comes quickly, before you're even very far into the "A's"... apparently he didn't.
I was repeatedly disappointed by the cursory, often puerile definitions which accompany most of the 2000 culinary terms Grimes presents.
The simplistic line or two of text each are accompanied by are often incomplete and sometimes down right misleading.
The introduction builds up the book as a necessary tool to help we little folk through the growing complexities of modern food buying and eating.
In a world no longer dominated by a few French terms we are led to believe that this book will bridge the gap between old-school cooking books (say, from before 1990) and the current state of culinaria.
Why then are so many of the terms defined in an out-dated, even archaic mind-set?
Take the term "brown sugar".
This book says it is "unrefined or partially refined sugar", a definition all well and good perhaps 200 years ago.
Today brown sugar is almost always made from refined sugar with a special molasses syrup and colorings added back to it - a very different thing indeed, and Grimes should know the difference.
The are innumerable other examples available in the same vein.
Additionally, Grimes give us "food lists" scattered periodically throughout the book but provides only sporadic support for the words used in them.
For example, there is a list of Varieties of Apples.
48 varieties are listed but when one wants more information on them it is often lacking.
Sure "Red Delicious" apples have an insipid definition in the "R" section but what about the more interesting varieties like "Sundowner", or "Lodi" apples?
No further mention of them can be found in the book.
There is also a huge list of "Fish and Seafood" but if you are intrigued by what the "Geoduck" or "Sprat" listed might be, you're out of luck (without running to a REAL culinary dictionary).
The bright (if limited) spots in the book are the articles on food etymology and history.
There are 7 of them (reprints from other publications and various authors) that are each informative and interesting.
Grimes would have done much better to have put together a collection of these little insightful gems and left the definitions to those more inspired by the subject.
My guess is that the brevity of the definitions (leading to rampant deficiencies) was, perhaps, an attempt at simplicity but the effective "dumbing-down" of the book is insulting to anything but the most elementary reader.
I know that Grimes, a former restaurant reviewer for the New York Times, must know a lot more about food than this book makes him sound.
Grimes is listed as the "editor" of this work (along with a number of others) and it defies logic why he would allow his name used as the primary.
Unfortunately, my copy of this book is destined for "re-gifting" or a permanent place on a dusty shelf somewhere while my venerable, dog-eared Larousse Gastronomic retains it's place of honor near my desk.
Bon appetite, ex libris, and caveat emptor.

Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that "Three Junes" was listed as a popular book choice.
The title sounded interesting so I bought it.
That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition.
It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline.
I will finish the book because that's my style.
It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to.
Spend your money elsewhere.
For someone who supposedly lives in the vicinity of Yellowstone he knows and sees little.
To anyone who steps outside of the sealed up world of their car and even casually looks, the senses are all brought to life with sights sounds, smells, temperatures, textures and colors.
Cahill does not inform.
He is not even a very good writer, for if he were, he'd do the same thing I did, huck the book into the trash.
Go to Yellowstone yourself and hang out the windows of your car and even that simple pleasure will tell you how inadequate this book really is.
Working in an IT company catering to bankers I bought this book to help understand their lingo.
I have to say it hasn't disappointed yet.
It is also very up to date the latest IT/banking terms.
If you were to read all the definitions in this book you would probably know more than you banker.
A great reference.
Buy it
What books you would grab as you ran out of a burning house?
Remember that old parlor game?
This is one on my list.
My copy is stained and spine-cracked and I could not live without it.
It's the standard by which all cookbooks should be measured
I couldn't read past the second chapter.
Roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about Muslims.
It really steamed me that she used a verse of the Quran out of context for the title page of "The Bitter".
"Your wives are your fields, so go to your fields as you like" isn't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the Quran.
I'm not going to finish this book, because I'd rather not be reminded of how much I am viewed as some sort of exotic, oppressed "other" type of woman, thanks.
This is a 4 CD set of meditations as a companion to The Inner Temple of WitchCraft book.
Using the background of the book, the CD's set up an easy way to work with the material in the book without having to open the book to reference it during the mediations.
Mr. Penczak's voice is perfect as far as I am concerned, it does not grate on you nor does it lull you into sleep.
The light melodic fill is just that, filler for the spaces between words and does not distract from the words.
I found the material covered to be good for meditation and it works well with the material in the book.
If you find the book to be what you are looking for, the CD's are a good addition.
I enjoyed the entire presentation, and Mr. Penczak gives us some very well based and solid material.

the first few chapters have built the anticipation for a good strategy to learn , HOWEVER, there were no formulas, nothing to learn.
book talks about theories about market timing with no proof.
i wouldent take it seriously as i though
We're all getting old and fat!
This book just makes you feel less alone about the ordeal
We have enjoyed another of Eric Carle's books--Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do You See--since my son was a few weeks old.
So, when my son was about 7 months old, I bought From Head to Toe.
It was a wonderful purchase!
After a few reads, my son was imitating the animals just like his mama--waving his arms like a monkey and on his hands and knees like the cat.
It was so wonderful for me to see that my son was understanding and processing the books I read to him.
The book is brilliant, no question about it.
His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful.
The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience.
And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.
Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book.
It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep.
I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).
If you want this book, get the paperback
I like the way it teaches fractions and doesn't use candy
This is one of the most insightful books I've ever come across.
The author is simply a genious.
Embracing the principles of this book may be the difference between developing a successful business or not
This is a cute story about a spider who drops in on a farm.
All the farm animals greet her and invite her to play.
But the spider spends the day building her web instead.
The book is fun and informative, and not at all scary.
The pages are doubled so they are easy to turn, but be careful, because inquisitive little fingers may reach inside the pages and rip them.
The book has about 350 words
"An American Tragedy" by Theodore Dreiser is considered one of the greatest American books ever written.
This may be the case if you can get past the first chapter.
Five times, I have tried to read this book.
To date, I am 0 for 5, having fallen asleep each time trying to read it.
If you're a bit of a lazy reader or one who doesn't want to work through a book, this is not for you.
Try Mark Twain instead
I always look to see if an author stands in their truth.
If they walk their talk.
Dr. Christiane Northrup does.
I have read all of her books, Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom, The Wisdom of Menopause and now Mother-Daughter Wisdom.
They all embody her path to well-being and her knowledge on the subject of women's health.
In her book Mother-Daughter Wisdom, she shares her own life experiences from raising two daughters and her expertise as a medical doctor and relates them to health and wellness.
I find this book to be a great tool and guide to help mothers raise empowered daughters and a model for a healthy mother-daughter relationship.
I have three grown daugthers and would have loved to have had this book when they were growing up.
I found out through much trial and error how to raise empowered daughters.
Dr. Northrup is a pioneer in our time venturing into these unchartered waters of how mothers and daughters can have a balanced and loving relationship.
She addresses the many challenges in our society today facing girls and gives suggestions on how to deal with them in a positive way.
She talks about mothers caring and nurturing themselves in order to care for their daughter.
This book is also a reference book as Dr. Northrup covers from birth to adulthood for the many stages in a mother and daughter's life.
Mothers, men, and women without children, would benefit by reading this book to connect with their own legacy with their mother or if raising a daughter.
This was a less than stellar sequal to The Women of the Silk but it did finish the story of Pei to some extent.
I found the historical aspect of the novel the most interesting and the story of the women the least believabl
People were looking for a book that could grab them about Nam when this was a best seller in 1972, and this book has details that people were not getting from television or the front page of newspapers in those days.
Magazines that published book reviews typically had a view of Nam that was tuned more to the nuance of individual points of view than the geopolitical justifications which failed to consider the nature of the situation in Nam itself as a primary consideration.
Portions of this book originally appeared in `The New Yorker,' so the author was becoming widely known as this book was being prepared.
Frances FitzGerald's original trip to Vietnam was in February to November of 1966, and resulted in articles for the `Atlantic Monthly,' the `Village Voice,' `Vogue,' etc.
People who read fashion magazines were particularly interested in what a nice girl might think of a situation like Nam, where large numbers of young Americans were being subjected to a military view of the situation on a personal level so intense that most publications would refrain from printing the kind of expressions which naturally describe the emotional shock of being shot at or booby trapped in some more surprising fashion.
This book is not perfect.
The only listing for `Tonkin Gulf Resolution' in the index is for the page on which President Johnson's use of the Resolution is questioned by Senator Fulbright in 1966.
That was the time this book is mainly concerned with, but it gives an enormous amount of background information.
It is possible to find a listing in the index under ` GVN' for `and U.S. entry into the war, 354' which gives the page that reflects Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara's testimony to Congress that: "It was in response to an amphibious sabotage raid by GVN forces that North Vietnamese PT boats attacked the U.S. destroyer Maddox, mistaking it for one of the South Vietnamese vessels."
(pp.
352-353).
Actually, the OPLAN 34A attacks along the Gulf of Tonkin coastline were operations planned and approved in Washington, D.C., and McNamara lied about South Vietnamese operations to maintain the secret status of U.S. operations, during which the North Vietnamese PT boats were responding to recoilless rifle fire from a small boat when American intelligence informed the Maddox that it was about to be attacked.
Radio intercepts of North Vietnamese naval messages on August 4, 1964, were used to convince LBJ and Senators that an attack had occurred when two American destroyers were picking up radar ghosts and sonar readings off the reflection of a hard-turned rudder, as shown by subsequent tests.
Edwin E. Moise's book, TONKIN GULF AND THE ESCALATION OF THE VIETNAM WAR has much more information about that secret circus stunt.
Jeffrey Kimball's recent book, THE VIETNAM WAR FILES: UNCOVERING THE SECRET HISTORY OF NIXON-ERA STRATEGY, contains a reference to the author of this book in a Memorandum by Dwight Chapin to Haldeman, January 18, 1973, about a month after heavy bombing near or in Hanoi to get some ceasefire agreement signed, hoping it could be called `The Peace Announcement' (p. 288) and attempting to describe a point of view different from what intellectuals were expecting.
"The FitzGeralds and the Fondas, the Halberstams and Harrimans, the Clarks and Ellsbergs and Baezes are poised in the wings just waiting to treat the end of the war as their victory and to so opine from coast to coast."
(Kimball, p. 291).
I have the First Vintage Books Edition, August 1973, which was after Dwight Chapin's Memorandum, but I am not sure if American bombing in Cambodia had ended when the actual paper in this book was printed on.
There are only six lines of listings in the index for Cambodia, mostly on general issues, but the week I spent there was hardly earth-shaking.
Of more interest to me was the report in FIRE IN THE LAKE about the An Lao valley, where the battalion 1/12th Infantry from the 4th Infantry Division spent the months from September, 1969 to January, 1970.
I believe this was our first free fire zone, with a base high above a village that had been destroyed, surrounded by paddies in which elephant grass was growing instead of rice, but enemy soldiers were found harvesting highland rice on the hillsides.
Enemy contact was the only kind we had, after all other possibilities had been eliminated in the manner described in this book.
"In Operation Masher/White Wing alone--a multi-regimental sweep through the north of Binh Dinh province--the Allied forces, by the estimates, destroyed an entire enemy division.
In the process they left hundreds of civilians dead and wounded and `generated' so many refugees as almost to depopulate the fertile An Loa valley."
(p. 405).
"While the American troops opened roads and `cleared' great stretches of territory, the Front guerrillas came back into every area except those heavily garrisoned by U.S. troops.
By the end of 1966 the NLF continued to govern the An Lao valley as well as the suburbs of Da Nang, Hue, Nha Trang, and Saigon."
(p. 406).
There is only one line in the index for Frantz Fanon, but anyone who is interested in how FitzGerald saw a link between revolution against colonial powers in African and Arab countries and the situation in Nam, "including the belief in Fate and the symbolic killing of self, which he called `the behavior patterns of avoidance.
.
.
.
the sudden crime waves that spread through the cities, the tribal warfare, and the fierce, irrational feuding of the native sects.
As he explained them, .
.
."
(p.509).
You wouldn't want to believe how true the stuff in this book could be today
In this fascinating collection of essays, Dr. Dalrymple proposes a compelling thesis.
Over the last twenty-five years a new type of underclass has emerged in western societies, an underclass that uses the welfare system in all its forms, subsidised housing, free by-weekly pay checks, child support and free medical benefits.
From a liberal political standpoint, this support for the nation's "have nots" is a compassionate gesture to take care of its own poor.
One would logically assume that providing the poor with life's essentials would bring the crime rate down and provide incentive for these people to further their standing in society.
In fact, as Dalrymple proposes, it has had an opposite effect: crime in his native England has skyrocketed; drug use is at an all time high and domestic violence is a wide spread common occurrence.
Why?
Liberal values not economics has created individuals that deny any responsibility for their own lives, it is always the rich, the government or societies institutions that is to blame, thus crime continues to rise while England's Welfare State has grown into an unwieldy Goliath.
Dalrymple has worked in numerous countries and has been an attending physician and psychiatric consultant in London's prisons for many years.
Thus his thesis is not born from some abstract social theory about human behaviour.
He has treated thousands of victims of domestic violence, consulted thousands of prisoners who have been incarcerated for petty crime to murder.
The common thread that runs through all these cases is a pathological denial of responsibility for their own circumstances or conditions.
As Dalrymple explains: "Like so many modern ills, the coarseness of spirit and behaviour grows out of ideas brewed up in the academy and among intellectuals - ideas that have seeped outward and are now having their practical effect on society.
The relativism that has ruled the academy for many years has now come to rule the mind of the population."
(P.85) In other words, this post modern notion that there is no high and low art, no good and bad, no subtlety and crudeness, only relative perspectives; taking this further, our behaviour too is not individually determined, but society and its oppressive inequalities that make me who I am, and a biological predisposition which causes me to steal from the old lady next door, beat my wife beyond recognition and consume drugs and alcohol like there is no tomorrow.
The trickling down of these academic theories, biological determinism, Marxism and the post modern theory that there are no levels of hierarchical values, only difference, has created an underclass of victims who believe they should get something for nothing and commit crime because society has created them as victims as self-determinism does not exist.
Dalrymple provides numerous real life examples from his practice working in a hospital in London.
His writing style is straight forward, at times literary but never sentimental.
The arguments in these essays are persuasive and push the reader to examine the underlying modern ideologies that have created and sustain a well provided for underclass of criminal "victims".
I was very disappointed in this book even though it was a miniature.
Some of the pages were blank, having not even been printed.
I figure the book was a total loss of money spent
I really enjoyed this book.
It was interesting and fast.
It kept my attention and I did not want to put the book down.
Another great story.
Stephen King is not typical in this book.
The development of the characters is awesome.
You felt everything that Dolores was going through and you know you would have done the same thing.
You route for her.
She is spunky, bitter but she means business.
Great book.
I highly recommend this book.
I read it in about 6 hours
Hey here's an idea.
What if Hitler was right all along, only it is men, not jews, who are to blame for all the woes of the world.
We should build a new Auschwitz and exterminate them all.
Right Andrea?
In my opinion, this is just as bad as any misogynist.
It's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women's liberation movement back for so long
Not that I don't like Shakespeare's works, but his tragedies are terrible, especially this one.
I can't understand the language real well, so I have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it'll be easier to understand.
I just can't understand this love tragedy at all!
Here are some things that confuse me: *How did this feud really begin?
*Why can't this story end in happily ever after?
*Why does Lady Capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody?
*Why couldn't Shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand?
*Why does everybody have to jump to conclusions?
I simply can't understand why people love this play so much.
It's ridiculous!
If you want a true love story, try reading "A Midsummer Night's Dream".
This one absolutely SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!
!
If you've read one Gary Null book, you've read them all.
He is no doubt highly knowledgeable and dedicated to his subject, but when I buy two books with different titles by Gary Null and find they are the same, I'm pretty annoyed.
His early books were taken directly from Herbert Sheldon's Natural Hygience material, which I assume must not have been copyrighted, and I felt ripped off then, in the 70's as I did recently when Amazon was good enough to give me a refund for one of the books.
I just finished the book today and I will start out by saynig that this is a very good read.
I will not spoil the plot if you have not read this book.
Oh, and this book is NOT scary, but it really is creepy.
Give it a go
Good books on popular music are, frankly, few and far between.
This is one of those precious few.
Journalist Dan LeRoy has done a remarkable job of piecing together the details of the creation of this album.
Even better, he has written an engaging story.
It might be a cliche, but I couldn't put it down.
TRUMAN CAPOTE's wrote THE GRASS HARP early in his career and it is an often overlooked gem.
This sweet, eccentric, moving and decidedly southern tale is the leisurely paced story of the repercussions that ensue when three townfolk decide to up and run away to live in a treehouse on the outskirts of town.
Three quickly becomes five and eventually swells to even more as the makeshift home becomes a sort of paradise and refuge where stories are shared, closeness is established, and love blooms....think FLANNERY O'CONNOR meets SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON with a dash of STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
Themes of finding one's place and path and making oneself known are skillfully woven into the narrative.
It has the feel of a fantastic and utterly charming myth.
Primary assets are the "thick as molasses" southern mood and syntax as well as a bevy of unforgettable characters.
I love this book - such a great novel detailing the friendship and bonds of a group of women over the years.
I'll be re-reading it
Anything by Dave Barry is genius - full of insight, uncannily funny, entertaining, and thought provoking.
Dave Barry Turns 50 makes a perfect small gift for 50th birthdays (as does Dave Barry Turns 40 for those a decade younger.
This textbook is more useful for the flashy (and admittedly very good) teacher's ancillaries.
But this review is not for the ancillaries.
It is for the text itself.
The text's treatment of proofs is very cursory and not rigorous enough.
The diagrams for the algebraic problems are too confusing, compiling numerous different concepts into one problem.
While I agree that students must learn to differentiate one property/theorem/rule/postulate from another, it doesn't make sense that most, instead of some, diagrams are over-complicated.
Personally, I don't like the format with the examples, mainly because it downplays the necessity for students to become LITERATE in math, not just a good "example comparer."
The text has little actual TEXT to speak of.
I have not been teaching HS for very long, but I do not like this book.
I am not a textbook dependent teacher, but I do (woefully) recognize that students have poor study skills and don't reference notes all the time.
I do not teach out of the textbook and I spend many hours planning lessons, lecture notes, my own examples, etc.
I had many complaints that the problems were confusing, included too many ideas at the same time, etc.
Some may be successful in "teaching themselves" from the examples, but I am very disappointed that textbooks no longer have TEXT.
I may be a math teacher, but I understand the importance of reading and how it helps a person to process the material.
On the other hand, the teacher resources is a great set of worksheets, study masters, note taking guides, etc.
Perhaps the authors spent more time on those resources instead of the text.
Definitely one of the best books I have read.
The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon is a complex mixture of simple things.
The simplicity of the language, style, ideas, characters and concepts is unique to this book.
The expression of complicated life matters and situations in such a simple manner makes this book a definite must-have.
In the book, Mark Haddon borrows the voice of his lead character Christopher, an autistic child, to tell the story.
Christopher is an autistic and smart 15 year old boy.
He's a math whiz with an unsatisfiable appetite to solve problems.
His approach to all life issues is to convert them into a math problem of some sort and find out ways to deal with these issues.
The story mainly revolves around Christopher's investigation to find out who killed his neighbour's dog Wellington.
Despite his father's instructions to not pursue the issue, Christopher goes on to attempt to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington.
The story unravels before Christopher and he is hit with a reality far more complex than his own understanding of life.
His investigations result in only unearthing long buried secrets of his mother who, he knows, died three years earlier.
Christopher's determination to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington and the mystery of his mother's death is something to be revered throughout the development of the story.
The child's emotional roller coaster ride is witnessed first hand on every page.
The reader experiences Christopher's feelings and emotions so transparently that it makes it extremely difficult not to feel attached to the story.
The story in itself is funny at times, sad and miserable at others; complex in one place and extremely simple in another.
This is a novel that you can be certain will change the way you perceive the things in your life once you are through.
Your world will never be the same again.
In a good way
This book will be invaluable now as I am going to groom my dog myself.
The instructions are easily understood
The book is entertaining, however if you wish to read this from a scholarly point of view and you have spent ANY time studying the ancient world to any degree...you will be appauled to find that the author of this book simply added his own interpretations to events, biblical texts, and blatantly stretched (pun so intended) the truth on so much.
I'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong, but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient Sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol.
If you take away any claim of being a historical reference, this book is good.
It's a tongue and cheek look on the penis and that is about all it does.
Totally not serious, but a giggle to be had here and there.
Some of which is at the author's expense
If Tess is going to continue to write books like this, she should switch her publisher to Harlequin Romance, it will give the unsuspecting buyer a "heads up."
It is not possible to describe the many short falls of this rather long boring novel without giving the romantic subplots away, let just say that the ME does no pathology as she is way too busy whining about an unatainable romance and the detective does no detecting as she is totally wrapped up in her parent's pathetic lives.
There is a bit of a mystery bouncing around in the book, but it is hardly worth wading through all those pages.
Come on Tess, you can do better than this
The book is AMAZING!
The CD is HORRIBLE!
Stick to reading the book yourself.
I have over 45 audio books...and this was like listen to a bad commercial.
I had to turn it off.
There is no connection between the narrator and the words he is reading.
They don't even state who the narrator is!
I recommend the book to anyone.
The content is life changing
The word Atlas is misleading as there is alot of text accompanying the various maps.
Some pages are nothing but text.
I expect an Atlas to use maps to explain more rather than words.
The maps that are in the book are good, but numerous sections do not have one.
The book is split into sections/topics written by individual persons.
However, in many sections the text ends in mid-sentence, as if several pages were forgotten about in each section or as if there was some arbitrary cutoff on the # of words per section.
of this approx 200 page book, sentence cutoffs appear on these pages.
Each page also represents the end of a section.
p.37,55,63,82,89,96,115,141,149,163, and 175 clearly, not just a simple oversight.
Also, the table of contents is inadequate, as it primarily denotes the major sections - which is by ocean, but not the individual topics.
I give this 2 stars (Rather than 1) as the idea is good, and the content that is in the book - looks good.
Execution is another story.
Frankly, I would be a embarassed by the editing and quality control oversights
I bought the book on the basis of the reviews and on a quick read of a copy a friend owned.
It looks really good on the surface and does have a lot of useful information.
One problem I found is that many of the example photos seem to be inserted only to increase the photo count.
Also, because of printing limitations, I find it very difficult to see the differences between before and after examples.
I have edited this review to fix an error.
However, I can not figure out how to change my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars.
Consider this a 4 star review.
I found the book very difficult to use and almost never had what I was looking for.
The small dictionary in the back of my eyewitness travel guide was much more useful
Another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation...
If you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...Unfortunately they don't come with disclaimers.
like one would get when reading a book on the occult... People tend to go for books that support their bigoted view, and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it....
It is a living.
When the Da Vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot's guide to the code, how to interpret the code etc etc....
I am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the NY times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad...
When considering the faith of the founders of the U.S, it is easy to rely on half-truths and assumptions.
David Holmes dispels a lot of myths in his well-researched book which uses historical documentation, personal letters, and observations of conduct in order to describe the various beliefs which the early patriots espoused.
He begins by describing the religious movements of the 18th.
century which influenced our founders.
One interesting point he makes is that 9 of the original colonies had government-sponsored churches, a practice which the country quickly abandoned when the colonies united into a nation.
Although many of the people he describes, including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson, were brought up in orthodox Christian churches, such as Episcopal and Congregational, they were later influenced by the Deist movement which opposed many orthodox Christian views.
He describes some interesting practices, such as the fact that George Washington would leave Anglican services before participating in communion, despite the fact that his wife Martha would stay for the sacrament.
This is only one example of an early political wife who stayed true to her orthodox upbringing despite the Deist leanings of her husband.
Holmes concludes his book with a brief description of modern-day presidents and their religious beliefs which bear much more scrutiny than the founding fathers' did.
In writing this book Holmes displays an impartiality which is fitting for an historian, and which makes it all the more believable
The Hellion Bride is the second book in Bride Series.
I love Ryder and Sophie and the joy of meeting other characters from The Sherbrooke Bride.
I kept turning the pages to find out their secrets.
Deceptive and abusive uncle Theo as well as murder scenes make the story more thrilling and a suspense.
The Virgin Bride also comes in handy and she is an angel rather than a ghost for she always is encouraging and very nice.
Sinjun pleasantly spices up the whole story.
I can't wait any longer to read her own story The Heiress Bride
I am supposed to get 16th edition, instead I received 15th edition.
The book was completely changed from the previuos editio
The companion web site mentioned in the book is not there.
When I typed in that URL, I got redirected to Peachpit's advertising site of this book, but no "links", "tools", nor "examples" mentioned in the book at all!
i bought this cookbook due to the introductory price I received and have loved every recipe I have tried.
Many of the recipies are heart healthy and I have found those to be tasty and easy to prepare.
Good luck and good cooking
A looming 21-year High School reunion has led me to ponder the past, especially the town I grew up in.
I have been reading The Geography of Nowhere by James Howard Kuntsler, a book which explores the rise of suburbia and automobile culture in America.
Kuntsler explores the effects of modernist design philosophy (Le Corbusier, Gropius, Bauhaus etc. )
.
Although Kunstler's book is by no means a complete history, his insights are provocative.
His basic thesis is that the rise of the automobile has led to the development of a banal and meaningless pppppppppp quot;geography of nowhere pppppppppp quot;.
In other words, since the 1920s, Americans have pursued a single-minded vision when it comes to urban development: namely treating our built surroundings as disposable commodities to be bought and sold, with little regard to aesthetics.
Growing up in a suburb, I experienced this sort of fake-non-reality-bubble of what a city should be, or what it should do for its residents.
There was always nothing to do, nowhere to go.
Fortunately, in those days, creative people created their own pppppppppp quot;scene pppppppppp quot;, no matter how lame it was.
Such a naive scene based on our libertine tastes and overbearing ignorance.
Of course, conformity was the rule.
And we all nearly s--t ourselves when we got behind the wheel of our first car.
It was almost like and 5-year-old's first trip to Disneyland.
It was like that first sexual experience.
It was an epiphany, of sorts.
Little did we realize that our addiction to auto travel would bring such a high cost to our lonely empty souls.
Who ever thought that being so cheap would cost us so much?
A lot of the reviews I have read here, both positive and negative, have noted Smith's acerbic and sometimes hostile tone.
In my own discussions on god, particularly when engaging Christians, I probably would not use SOME of the more harsh language found in the book.
It tends to be devisive and unproductive, and also reinforcing many of the deragatory stereotypes that are applied to Atheists.
That does not mean that any of Smith's arguments are not legitimate or powerful.
They should be confronted by ANYONE who takes any position regarding religion or god.
Perhaps the most revealing and important passage of the work comes at the beginning of the Chapter discussing the purported "proofs" for the existence of good posited by Christian Thealogians and laymen.
Smith explains that "Many times in the past, before knowing better, I would engage in arguments with theists who claimed to have a rational foundation for their belief.
After several painstaking hours of pointing out flaws in the proposed arguments, I would receive some form of the following comment: 'well, it really doesn't matter if these proofs are invalid, because I have faith in the exstence of god anyway.'
The Theist who resorts to this approach has no claim to rationality- only lack of integrity."
Smith's frustration throughout the text at this type of intrangisence is palpable and, ultimately, entirely understandable.
Some of the reviews on this page are illustrative of the general resentment which most Christians seemed to hold for the methods by which human beings acquire knowledge and distinguish truth from falsehood.
As an outspoken Atheist, I have heard these types of decrees repeated to me ad nauseum- and they never stop being disturbing.
"Lean not on your own understanding," I have been told again and again.
"Trust in the lord and stop using all this silly logic," or "god wants us to believe like children," they will say.
All I hear is: "I am happy being ignorant.
You will be happy in this delusional fantasy land I live in, too.
I know god is not just an inadequate answer to these questions, but no answer at all.
Things don't need answers, or explanations, or anything.
Everything is ok because I have faith in god."
Hence, I sympathize with Smith's frustration.
I urge all Atheists to read this book, which reads more or less like a conversation between an atheist and an extremely intellectual and sophisticad christian who spews (practically)every argument ever conjured to be a believer or to be a Christian, and has them overwhelmingly refuted.
Smith understands the obstanince that Atheists will inevitably encounter when Christians (particularly unsophisticated Christians) are challenged.
This is probably the reason why some of his repudiations seem unnecessarily expatiated.
Any atheist who has offered apologetics in defense of atheism knows that trying to engage a christian is like playing Whack-a-mole, as soon as one battle is definitvely won the Christian will retreat into a sheild of ignorance.
This act, Smith accurately points out, will usually involve the word "faith" being substituted for, but meaning the exact same thing as, "ignorance."
I assume this is why SMith so meticulously tears apart the idea of something that human beings call "faith" being an effective(or even theoretically plausible) conduit to fundamental truth.
He also points out the common ways that Christians like William Lane Craig and J.P. Moreland use mangled science or language to misrepresent the issues at hand.
As a small example of this that I found interesting, in "Does God Exist?," J.P. Moreland states that he believes that people can actually perceive god through something he calls "Numinous Perception."
Moreland does not give an explanation of how an outside observer could ever deiscern whether someone was having a genuine "Numinous perceptive" experience, or how exactly numinous perception would actually work physiologically or psychologically.
Conveniently, this would rule out any chance of Moreland's hypothesis ever being tested and shown to be accurate or inaccurate.
When someone hears an argument like this, one can easily turn to Smith for excellent articulation of why they are absurd and illegitimate.
Smith writes: " My argument with the Christian is that he claims to have experienced god, but he refuses to explain the process by which he, a physical organism, experienced this supernatural being.
I won't limit him arbitrarily to the traditional five senses, but I will demand that he present evidence for his new perceptual powers.
Has he discovered a new sense?
Fine, then let him tell us about it so we can test it.
No christian has ever succeeded in explaining just how he perceives his mysterious god.
He claims to have knowledge of a mysterious, unknowable being, having gained this knowledge in some mysterious unknowable manner.
This is totally unacceptable."
Moreland's clever creation of a scientific sounding title for perception of god does not help him.
This book will help atheists with this type of argumentation through just about any thread of thought a theological argument can get into.
Yes, the rhetoric 30 years later SOUNDS more sophisticated (with other clever titles like "intelligent design theory"), but it is not ACTUALLY more compelling or sophisticated than when Aquinas wrote his five proofs or Russell challenged Copelston.
I reccomend this book and I can't wait to read "Why Atheism?"
(Just as a curious note, does anyone know if SMith actually debated people in public?
If anyone knows of any transcriptions id love to read some, please let me know if you do.

One of the best!
You cannot go wrong reading this as an intro to Islam.
Truly an insiders look.
A must read for everyone who loves freedom
Professor Solove comments about me on page 147 are out and out lies.

I am both astounded and confounded by the reviews here.
Simply put, this is the single worst novel I have ever read.
Everything about it--the writing, the characters, the story--is godawful.
Here follows an absolutely true story.
While I was forcing myself to read this drivel, I went out on date.
She and I were discussing how much of a book one should read before giving up on it.
I was advocating the 25 page litmus, and she insisted on at least fifty.
She did several long train commutes a week to and from work, and so read a lot of novels.
Anyway, I started describing this book.
She recognized it immediately, and interrupted me saying, pppppppppp quot;The Bear Went Over The Mountain!
Don't read another word!
If you think it's bad now, it only gets worse, if you can believe it!
pppppppppp quot; She was right.
If you feel the need to find out for yourself, save your money and borrow it from a friend or the library
Just when you thought you've heard all Larry has to offer... it gets WAY better...
I've only just started reading it the past 2 days, but I have to say it..
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE THAT'S FUNY RIGHT THERE!!!!!
He's got hte downhome Good Ole Boy humor mixed 9at least i see it that way) with a good interpretation of how ALL "blue coller" working class people are.
I may be a yankee.. but I'm from the great city of PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA..... AND WE LIVE AND THRIVE ON GOOD OLE AMERICAN LIVING.
Funny how Redneck verbage and Pittsburghese IS errily SIMILAR.
Makes me PROUD to wave, wear and salute the red white and blue
After two weeks on this diet plan I could bearly lift my head up.
I nearly fell asleep driving home from work nights...not to mention hardly staying awake while at work.
I thought it would be a pleasant change from the restrictions of Atkins, but I was never tired on Atkins.
I don't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs...or what the problem was.
All I know is I am happily following Atkins and losing much more rapidly than I did on this CAD plan.
In two weeks I lost 6 lbs.
on CAD...14 on Atkins.
You figure it out
more hate books.
How could anyone write anything so wrong
To anyone who has or is planning on reading this book, consider this.
This book has a lot of words which feel good and can make anyone's guilty conscience ease in thinking that "your own will is god's own will."
(quoted from Walsh's books) If you will it, then God wills it because he loves you and wants you to live in freedom, right?
Will is a precursor to action.
If there is no such this an a 'right' or 'wrong' will, then in essence there is really no such thing as a 'right' or 'wrong' action.
If someone else's actions hurt you, you feel that action is wrong.
But the person who hurt you certainly had his feelings for acting that way, right?
It was his will, therefore he was justified and right and god's right there to back him up.
The victim is suffering.
Where is his god when he needs him?
Was the victim correct in believing the action wrong?
Was the perpetrator correct in believing his action was right?
In this book, god says that WE have the authority to decide what is right or wrong.
The action is both right and wrong, right?
Wrong.
This is when you may want to take a look at the Bible.
The Bible portrays God as a loving yet HOLY God.
Holy is defined as exalted or worthy of complete devotion as one perfect in goodness and righteousness.
He loves us but sees a REAL AND DISTINCT right and wrong as clear as day where sometimes it appears to be a tangled mass to our limited senses.
He created us and gave us a conscience which can in most cases discern a right and wrong in a situation.
He gave us a free will which allows us to then choose that right or wrong.
Are we always going to do the right thing?
No, and He knows that.
When we do wrong thing, it is unhealthy at best to believe that doing wrong is the right thing to do because we desire it.
We're NOT God.
We do wrong all the time and God simply wants us to acknowledge this.
He wants us to exercise our FREEWILL to do right according to our conscience and what's told in His book.
But he knows that even still we will do wrong when attempting in good faith to do right.
And that is why in a generous act of sacrificing Love He sent His Son Jesus Christ to SHOW us the way, sacrifice Himself on the cross for our wrongs, and be there still today to forgive our wrongs when we believe in Him and in the truly amazing thing He did for us.
It's a beautiful thing!
I urge you to believe that the Holy Bible is not a lie and Jesus Christ simply did the things the book said He did and is the person He claimed to be.
11 disciples took everything they said and wrote to their grave and never recanted even after much persecution.
Wow!
I've been a believer in Christ for almost seven years and He's continued to worked wonders in my life.
I would have been a fan of these books if God had not put me on His path.
In case you're wondering, I gave this book 2 stars because it has reinforced my faith in Christ by giving a glaring example of what God is not.
If you've read through all of this, thank you.
I encourage you to write me.
God bless!
As I was reading this book, I came across many poems that were far too sexually explicit for my taste, to name a few: "The First," "Early Images of Heaven" and "Full Summer."
I found these poems to be highly offensive, and improper for the general audience.
Had I been warned of the book's sexually explicit content ahead of time, I would not have read it.
I believe that it should be so marked on the cover so potential readers know what they are getting into
Through Forster's impressive command of the English language and advanced character development, the story of Helen pppppppppp Margaret Schlegel unfolds.
The sisters--who are highly educated, pensive, and artistic--become entangled with the Wilcox family--practical, unilateral capitalists--and the Basts--working class and unassuming.
However, the initially subtle differences between the sisters (and how they approach love, misfortune, and personal relations) become more obvious as the novel progresses, climaxing in a scandalous ending that was unexpected from a high-brow English novel.
(I think some of the 1 and 2 start reviewers never actually read the novel to its dramatic end) Human nature notwithstanding, the novel's refinement, gorgeous writing, and riveting story-telling prevail to the end.
I loved it!
The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.
Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.
This CD totally KILLS that.
First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.
And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!
While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs
Still a great read, but not as good as Tender at the Bone and Comfort Me with Apples.
Foodies will love the continued insight into restaurant review protocol, but the author really shines when she remembers early food experiences with her mom, dad and other relatives and friends.
The highs are not as high, nor the lows as low in Garlic and Sapphires.
Reichl has a long way to go to lose me as a reader; that said, I hope she has a few more early memories to incorporate in her next book
I am an avid reader and have never once submitted a book review.
However, after reading Botox Diaries, I felt compelled to write and warn you all that this book is dull, trite, and disjointed.
I love my "chick-lit" books, but Botox Diaries is a disgrace to this genre.
The plot is weak and unrealistic (even in light of the suspended disbelief one normally affords "lite pppppppppp fun" books).
The plot is also disjointed, perhaps because two authors co-wrote this book.
The characters are shallow and excruciatingly dull.
Botox Diaries is absolutely the worst book I have ever read.
-- December 2005 Update: My friend insisted on reading this book (ugh...despite my warnings!).
Even though she was stuck in the airport for eight hours, she still couldn't bear to finish the book, because she found it so dull.
She actually left it, half-read, at the airport
I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed.
Not so in this book.
I found the first half really boring and hard to get through.
The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me
After reading this book and reading the Amazon.com readers' reviews to this book, it is evident that there are "White-readers" who do not understand hooks' point and the basic notion and theory behind racism.
My suggestion is that if you are white, you should explore the topics of racism, power, and class before attempting to understand the depths of which hooks is writing
The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book.
I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.
Without those details, the book seemed "unfinished".
It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.
Boring in my opinion.
I find it difficult to rate and review parenting books with such specific agendas, such as The Continuum Concept.
I fear that alone this book would render a nervous, new mother terrified of failure!
I am wary of books that pretend there is only one way to raise every child.
That said, I adore text that encourages instinctual, intuitive parenting.
Coupled with the dozens of other parenting guides I have read (from all spectrums), The Continuum Concept is a very valuable book.
The "bottom-line" on "Brainless" is that one has to be "brainless" to take time to read Coulter's writings, and even more brainless to waste the time to read an analysis of them.
Yes, it is mildly interesting to learn of Coulter contradictions (eg.
bashes the elite, then takes on Harriet Miers - partly because she didn't go to an elite law school, and "I believe everything I say," vs. "Most of what I say, I say to amuse myself and amuse my friends."
And then there are the infinite number of brainless "Coulterisms" and unsupported assertions - eg.
"public schools have more sex scandals per year than Catholic priests - thirty times more," "Liberals lie about the science on stem-cell research because they warm to the idea of destroying human embryos," "I've never seen people enjoying their (9/11) husbands' deaths so much."
On the other hand, Maguire really doesn't have that much to say that IS INTERESTING!
On the other hand, if you hadn't figured out already that there is someting seriously wrong with Ann Coulter - this book won't help.
Save your money and your time
It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.
Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.
Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.
With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.
Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.
What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.
Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?)
is beside the point.
They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories.
The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.
Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.
Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.
Golding is a deeply symbolic novelist who relies, especially in this novel and in The Inheritors (1955), on ideas from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology.
The central symbol of The Lord of the Flies is that of a pig's head upon a stick stuck in the ground, a totem in the making perhaps, but seen by Golding as Beelzebub, the "lord of the flies," the devil, a head of rotting flesh enveloped by flies.
The central idea is that without civilization we will degenerate into predatory animals ruled by superstition, the will to power, and the primordial need to survive.
When Piggy's glasses, which symbolize the tools and knowledge of our culture are broken, it signals the degeneration, the return to the wild in which, as Thomas Hobbes has it, there are "No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."
That a group of English school boys could degenerate so quickly after crash-landing on a deserted island may be seen as a bit fanciful, or more exactly, as the artifice of the artist; nonetheless, the premise of this extraordinary work may well serve as a cautionary note for our times.
Should we, through nuclear warfare, a runaway greenhouse effect, sectarian violence on a global scale, or through the exhaustion of the fossil fuels that power our civilization, regress to the state of savages, we have this warning.
Instead of the noble savage, instead of a return to the Garden of Eden, instead of the Swiss Family Robinson or Robinson Crusoe, Golding takes us step by step from the world of the boy's school to life and death power struggles and a fascination with savagery to the beginnings of tribal warfare.
As in The Inheritors, Golding sees not the good in humans, but the viciousness.
In The Inheritors we homo sapiens murdered the gentle Neanderthal, here we children become gangsters of the island, on our way to becoming tribal chieftains as murderous and vengeful as the God of the Old Testament.
I understand that Golding wrote the novel in part to answer the pollyannaish naivete of R.M.
Ballantyne's The Coral Island (1857), which I haven't read.
Clearly cruelty is one of Golding's main themes.
Left to their own devices and without the restraint of civilization's justice, humans will be cruel sometimes just to be cruel and sometimes as a means of gaining power.
The boys Ralph and Piggy naively try to set up a democratic sort of government, but are defeated by the brutality of Jack and his will to savagery.
The loss of innocence that the boys experience is seen as not the loss of something they intrinsically had, but of something superimposed upon them by civilization.
In reality, Golding is saying, there is no innocence in children, that is only a fairy tale idea to which we romantically subscribe.
This is one of those novels that has found its way onto the high school or even the middle school curriculum because it is easy to read and because it is easy for young people to relate to.
But the strength of this novel lies not only in its theme and readability but in the fine characterizations of the individual boys.
As in all great works of literature, it is the combination of character and story that compels us to turn the pages, and invites our admiration.
It should be noted that Golding deliberately left out one of the central drives of humans, probably because he did not want to muddy up his theme of savagery, or perhaps because he felt the task too great or perhaps because he didn't find the task palatable.
I am referring to the lack of sexuality in the novel.
Not only are there no girls on the island, but the boys do not, at least overtly, involve themselves in sex.
We can see that Golding's artistry anticipated this criticism since it can be argued that the boys in this situation and at their tender age are not yet ready to express themselves sexually.
I wonder if postmodern psychology would agree.
Certainly Freud would not.
Bottom line: a great read, a terrific adventure, but not a book in my opinion that should be read by preteens, in other words, you need to be older than the characters in the book in order to read the book without fear of nightmares
This is my favorite of the series thus far.
Without wanting to give too much away, this is the book in which you finally learn just exactly why Roland is willing to give up anything and everything (and clearly has) just to get to the Dark Tower.
King mentions that the Dark Tower series is sort of like his Middle-Earth, where all of his stories originate in some way from this massive odyssey and world, and you see what he means with this book.
Fan's of The Stand will recognize signs of the super flu within the first few hundred pages, and one of my all time favorite King villains comes back to pay his respects
Although the original Elements of Style was written in 1919 (or earlier), it still holds true that anyone who wants to learn how to write in a clear and concise manner will benefit from this book.
After reading this book you'll know to avoid breaking elementary rules and principles that are made in writing: excessive use of adjectives and adverbs, writing in the passive voice, using different tenses in writing, using the improper case of pronouns (example: using "who" when "whom" should be used and vice versa).
One of the most important things that the writer stands to gain from this book is an improvement in his writing style.
After reading this book, you will know how to write in a way that comes naturally, write with nouns and pronouns (not superfluous adverbs and adjectives), write and then rewrite, but do not overwrite and overstate, use orthodox spelling, do not explain too much, avoid fancy words, be clear, do not inject opinions, use figures of speech sparingly, and countless other helpful techniques.
To say that this book should be required reading for all writers is an understatement.
This book should be required reading for anyone that writes
Much of the book's material is not restricted to educational research.
It is generally applicable to anyone who wants to perform experimental studies in the social sciences.
Where you need to deal with human subjects.
Granted, in the book, these subjects are often primary school kids.
But the guidelines given in such matters as the general steps for qualitative research, data collection and data analysis are quite general.
Likewise further in the book, when it discusses quantitative research.
The book's discussion of statistics is necessarily abbreviated; directed at a reader unfamiliar with chi square tests and the like.
But still easily understood
I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.
Wow, what a disappointment.
This is sappy and poorly written.
How does Mitch Albom keep getting on the best sellers list
For those looking to dig deeper into the nuances of the C language, this is an excellent book!
It has given me a better understanding of C that is helping me design better C code.
A must have
I saw the 1963 classic first, which happens to be one of my most favourite ghost movies of all time!
(what a major disappointment the remake was).
So as soon as I could a got a copy of this.
It was an awesome novellete.
I read it in one sitting, couldn't put it down!
I do have to say I enjoyed the movie better...but this is a great journey as well.
I call this one "Frank Peretti Lite."
It was very entertaining but not a deep as his previous books.
Instead of focusing on sin and spiritual warfare, this one had a creationist angle.
I really enjoyed it, just not the same as his other books.
Also, you have to remember that this is fiction.
Of course the scenario is highly unlikely if not impossible.
But the central point about mutations comes through.
Great summer read
I just finished listening to as much of the book on CD as I could stomach.
The minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating.
The words forhead, perp, peruse, crim, and finger were repeated over and over and over.
What might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone's clothing, spouses, children, and thinking
This book is not worth wasting your money on.
The techniques that are represented look OK to the untrained eye, but if you examine them closely, you will notice many mistakes.
The techniques are sparse, one per angle.
They are also demonstrated with poor posture and attack.
To the novice, this book may appear to represent the art of Cabales Serrada Escrima, but it does not.
More than half of the book is unrelated to the system of Serrada.
This book does nothing to show the effectiveness of Cabales Serrada Escrima
well, i thought that the book was coming.
when i did not arrive at the last possible date i emailed and was told it was on backorder.
they did let me get a refund which was nice.
i would use them again for that reason alone.
As someone very interested in urban exploration (especially in the subways) I wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it.
After reading many of these Amazon reviews though, I opted out of a purchase, and took it out of my Bronx library instead.
Thank goodness as I only wasted valuable time, and not any money.
This book is a sham.
It is obviously mostly fiction.
And it's boring fiction at that.
The book is divided into chapters, each chapter a new "adventure."
I read the subway one first, where the "explorers" take the 6 train around the loop at the end of the line, to see the City Hall Station, which opened in 1904 (NYC's first station) and closed in 1948.
The station is located on the loop of the 6 train, that makes the southbound trains go back up north after the last stop, Brooklyn Bridge.
First of all, anyone can go on this "adventure."
Just stay on the train at the last stop, Brooklyn Bridge, and that's it.
Despite the author's attempt to make this sound risky, no conductors walk through the train to see if anyone is on (like they really care), just sit down.
The author created some "European tourists" that inadvertantly stayed on the 6 after the last stop, and the author even tries to create some mystery by saying "are we on the wrong train?"
Well, unless all those huge "6" signs that are lit all over the train are difficult to read, then you probably got on the correct train.
The author also fails to mention that the MTA used to give public tours all the time through this station (and others like the 18th street on the 6 and more) but stopped after 9-11.
This chapter was a joke.
I started reading the other chapters, and saw they were no better.
I then started to breeze through the book.
One thing that is very obvious - no photographs of the adventures are in the book at all.
This, despite the fact that on page 67 the author states, "Josh takes out his camera and snaps away at every pipe and puddle..." But no photos of their "adventures" are in the book.
Why?
Because it's fiction.
There are photos of what they are supposed to be exploring, sure, that's easy.
There's even one pic of one of these clowns hopping some fence somewhere, ooo.
Buit no pics of the actual "adventures."
I guess "Josh" lost all those pictures when he went to CVS to have them developed.
The funny thing is, you can save yourself a lot of time by just going online and viewing pictures of these things for yourself.
Especially the City Hall station, there are tons of pictures of it available from the people that were in there during the tours.
Just stay away from this sham of a book, it's really a huge waste of time
Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.
His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.
However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)
We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.
Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead
This book explains in simple terms all the stuff that the other one's don't explain.
It's one of the best books on photography hands down.
It's clearly the next step in amature photography you will need.I am currently waiting for it to arrive at my door.
I have read it already.
I want to own it so I have it forever.
I plain on absorbing every comma, period and explaination mark, and explaining it to everyone.
My hat's off to the author.
I LIKE IT
I have read all of the Scarpetta novels through The Last Precinct, and I have never wanted hours of my life back as I did when I finished The Last Precinct.
Cornwell tried to go in a new direction with her writing, and it failed.
If Kay Scarpetta was a fortune teller, this book may have been alright... What I mean by that is, in at least 2-3 separate occassions in this book, Kay says "I had a feeling I knew exactly what [so in so was going to say/do to me..." Really Kay?
Out of absolutely nowhere, you just believe that the unusual way Marino has been acting is due to the fact that you are going to be prosecuted by a special grand jury for homicide even though NOTHING led up to your supposed "revelation."
You are truly impressive.
Reading this book makes me want to steer clear of Blowfly and Trace, but then again, maybe Cornwell read some reviews and saw that she had to shape up.
This book really ticked me off and I wouldn't recommend it to an enemy
I enjoy food but most of the recipes in this book are things I wouldn't eat in the first place
I read this book after the authors (Scott pppppppppp Omari) told me about it on one of the public forums (about GMAT).
Excellent book, it's gives the overall picture of what an MBA candidate should look like to an admission officer at the B school.
It definitely gives you an edge.
This is book is like 'everything about B school applications in a nutshell'.
There are some methods like drawing a 'grid' to see where you stand, really gives insight into what are your strenghts pppppppppp the areas you should improve or 'cover' in the application essays.
Overall, not the one pppppppppp only but very good book.
interesting, well documented, with marvelous illustrations.Definitely a good buy for adults who still dream of fairy tales characters.
It is a pity that the collection does not include stories from "One thousand and one nights".
Otherwise it will be perfect and complete.
I picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed.
Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise.
This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events.
Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn't matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway.
The setting is the same as the first book, an alternate mid-1980s England in which literature is the preeminent social preoccupation.
Fresh off the events of "The Eyre Affair", Thursday Next (a police officer specializing in literature related crimes, such as first-edition forgeries, valuable manuscript thefts, and the like) is gritting her teeth through a new round of fame as the woman who saved Jane Eyre (and changed the ending for the better), when all she wants to do is cuddle up at home with her new husband Landen.
Unfortunately, the evil Goliath Corporation has managed to use a corrupt member of the Chronogaurd (timestream police) to delete Landen from this timeline and are holding his existence hostage.
In the first book Thursday imprisoned one of their top men inside Poe's "The Raven", and it seems they want him back.
This a potentially interesting plot, but it keeps get lost amidst all the other things Fforde throws into the mix.
Most notable are a series of strange coincidences which keep coming close to killing Thursday (and are also linked to events in the first book).
Another plotline concerns the discovery of a "lost" Shakespeare play, which looks to be the most important literary event of the century, if Thursday can authenticate it.
There's also the small matter of Thursday's pregnancy.
And just when one is comfortable with Thursday's role as a "SpecOps Litratech", and that whole milieu, she's thrown into an entirely new one as a member of "Jurisfiction", a kind of police comprised of book characters who move around in different literary works and maintain order...
Finally, her father pops up to inform her that something in the timestream has gone wrong and the entire world is going to be turned into a mass of pink sludge in a few days unless he can figure it out, and can she help him.
Phew!
I've probably missed one or two elements, but you get the idea.
Fforde is just brimming with nifty ideas, but the shame of it is that he can't stop and give any of them the attention they deserve.
It's impossible to get invested in any of the plotlines when you know he's just going to move on to something else in a few pages, and it's impossible to care about the characters when their existence is utterly malleable, as is time and place.
I suppose it's all meant to be puckish good fun, but the overall effect is more an attention deficit disorder Nancy Drew heroine meets a poor-man's Douglas Adams.
The book has its occasional moments, but the humor is far too broad and unsubtle, and there's absolutely no narrative tension.
All the literary in jokes in the world can't save this shambling wreck, and I don't think I'll be moving on to the next book.
I don't own this book nor have I read it, but if that first sentence is any indication of the quality of writing, I won't ever.
It is not a sentence.
One would think you would save your non-sentences for someplace else in a book, not start off with one, giving your readers the impression that you are all hat and no cattle before you even make your points
Many people remember the battle of Midway as the turning point of the war in the Pacific due to the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers, and rightly so.
But would the American success at Midway been possible without the heroic actions of their torpedo squadrons?
Probably not.
In this eye-opening account of the battle, author Alvin Kernan sheds much new light on these intrepid airmen who, flying obsoloete aircraft and using defective torpedoes, cleared the way for the SBD Dauntlesses to deliver the crushing blows on the Japanese carriers.
After sighting the enemy carriers, the three American flattops began launching their torpedo bombers, dive bombers, and fighters in the hopes of making a coordinated attack on the Japanese fleet.
However, while en route to the target, almost all of the squadrons became separated and the USS Hornet's contingent of fighters and dive bombers never even made it to the Japanese fleet.
Its aircraft either returned to the carrier or ditched in the sea.
Meanwhile, ,the planes from USS Yorktown and USS Enterprise were not able to coordinate their attacks.
Thus, the torpedo planes attacked without fighter protection.
These planes were thrown into a virtual meat grinder of anti aircraft fire and pursuit from Japanese fighters.
Out of a compliment of 51 planes, 44 were shot down.
One man, Ensign George Gay, survived from Torpedo squadron 8.
Not a single American torpedo hit the Japanese fleet.
However, this sacrifice was not in vain, for a few minutes later, the SBDs found the Japanese and in the span of a few minutes sent three Japanese carriers to the bottom.
The fourth followed later in the day.
The author brings up some interesting points in the book.
For example, he mentions the confusing flight plan of the Hornet's commander Ring, who, for some reason, chose to fly a course which would take him well north of the Japanese fleet.
He then failed to write an after action report upon returning to the Hornet.
The author also describes the inferiority of the American aircraft, specifically, there extremely limited range which, in the end, caused the American fighters to turn back.
Also, the fighters that did make it to the Japanese fleet never flew down to help out the lumbering Devastators.
In all intents and purposes, the SBDs happened to end up in the right place at precisely the right time.
If they had not, the battle could have turned out much differently.
This is a fascinating book.
I've read several books about the battle of Midway, but none have went into the depth of exploring the destruction of the torpedo planes as this one does.
The writer, a former member of the Enterprise's air group, describes the battle as only a true eyewitness could.
He raises some alarming quetions which I had never thought about before reading this book.
Although the book itself is somewhat short, it does a masterful job of covering the plight of the torpedo planes.
I highly recommend this fine book.
If you've read anything previously about the battle of Midway, you must read this book.
It sheds some new light on the heroic sacrifice of the American torpedo squadrons and how their actions paved the way for the American victory
When the truth about 911 is known he must not escape justice.

This book is excellent reading to inspire leadership.
Its greatest asset is the fact that Connelly selects great leaders and writing that characterizes their personal leadership styles
I love this cookbook.
There are so many amazing recipes.
As someone who is allergic to dairy, I am totally blown away at how creamy some of the dishes are.
Besides the recipes, the book is filled with beautiful pictures and profound quotes that combine together to create a really special reading experience.
I highly recommend this cookbook to vegans, vegetarians, people allergic to dairy and wheat, and meat eaters, as well
As I read, I kept trying to figure out whether this tale is a collection of reflections on how two religions can destroy a region and its people, whether the characters have broader agendas than their stories or whether it's just a good tale peppered with strong political images.
And, a good story it is.
How can you beat this writing?
"The pandits of Kashmir were left to rot in their slum camps, to rot while the army and the insurgency fought over the bloodied and broken valley, to dream of return, to die while dreaming of return, to die after the dream of reture died so that they could not even die dreaming of it, why was that why as that why was that why was that why was that" (p. 297) "The beauty approached him, beckoning.
Her arm slipped around his shoulder, supple as a snake, and like a snake her leg coiled around his.
Then like a third snake her other arm and like a fourth snake her other leg until she was slithering all over him.... She had as many arms and legs as a goddess, and multilimbed and irrestible she coiled and tightened around him and, finally, with all the power she possessed, she bit.
The accidental death by king cobra snakebit of [the] General was announced ... the next morning and he was buried with full honors.... (p. 316) " p. 31
Prof. Gardner's book is disappointing.
He tries to be all things to all people saying both that he believes in basic competencies but wants to put inquiry first.
Also, his language is inflated, and lacking in philosopical specificity.
For example, he believes in building up the inner world of "mental representations" [unexplained term] yet insists on "performances of understanding" [another unexplained term].
Also, he has respect for the individual learner and individual differences, yet he is concerned about the "position" or "situation" or social class dynamics in which the learning takes place.
Thus, he fails to do justice either to the individual or to class, race, or gender.
The role of leadership in learning is wholly ignored; and responsibility is not explored.
In short, it is extremely difficult to pin down Prof. Gardner.
It would be kind to say he is eclectic.
I hope it's just not fuzzy thinking.
However, we can discern that he has a romantic obsession with beauty, truth, and goodness.
Imagine -- the Holocaust is reduced to being an illustration of what goodness is or is not!
His treatment of these ideas is superficial and banal.
I don't like to be so judgmental, but his writing about them does not deserve a detailed analysis.
When attacking E.D.
Hirsch whom he calls the main speaker for "cultural literacy," he sets up a straw man.
He says that Hirsch's school of thought has an underlying belief in the Lockeian "tabula rasa."
Yet, I find nothing in Hirsch's writings to indicate that he believes in a tabula rasa.
Further, is Prof. Gardner really less elitist than Hirsch as some have claimed?
I have found that the Harvard elite spend their entire lives trying to achieve and learn everything, and be on top.
Their lives are marked by ambition to the Nth degree; yet, he debunks time-honored and experience-honored content areas that traditionally have defined literacy at its best.
Thus, I find a certain inherent dishonesty in Gardner's presentation.
Believe me, friends, I have taught students who have many ideals, Greek ideals and other ideals, but know very little, nor do they aspire to learn.
If they have those ideals, and if they are facile and glib, will they be the leaders of tomorrow who are embraced by Prof. Gardner?
I find a tendency on Prof. Gardner's part to oversimplify certain issues like the Holocaust, and to overcomplicate certain others like the nature of intelligence.
The world is not waiting for the concept of intelligence to be re-written.
Am I oversimplifying when I think that there is something very awkward about saying that there is no fundamental difference in intelligence between Einstein and the custodian of my school?
Is this awkwardness because I am an elitist putting down the custodian?
Is it because of lack of intelligence that I am still in the grip of a univocal definition of intelligence?
I don't think so.
Rather, we all know we are dependent on each other, and that everybody has some unique aptitudes or gifts they can express and be respected for, but trying to elevate this understanding to a higher level of truth or intellectual significance seems to me to be illegitimate.
Lastly, his writing style is a bit too fond of adjectives, and the book reads as a whole like It Takes A Village by Mrs. Clinton.
The Disciplined Mind has a mellifluous style that presents itself as being highly sophisticated and, at the same time, as down-to-earth, with balanced common sense.
Yet, ultimately, the book is boring.
As one Amazon reviewer states, Prof. Gardner is full of himself.
In this book, there is no straightforward discussion or emphasis placed on knowledge, justice, Judeo-Christian values, persistence, responsibility, or character development...words which I find essential for a true philosophy of education.
Barbara Ghazarian's book is a wonderful collection of recipes that originated in an ancient culture.
I enjoyed reading about her family and how Armenian food remains a large part of the communal family experience.
These foods from the Mediterranean region are exciting, flavorful, and easy to make.
Barbara's emphasis on bulgur wheat -- a staple in the Armenian diet -- is particularly important, as this whole grain product has stood the test of time.
It might even be considered the gold standard of healthy, easy-to-prepare grains.
Simply Armenian gives Americans a way to incorporate whole grains, meats, and vegetables into a healthy meal that a family can share.
While I read the book, a line kept running through my head: "our grandmothers were right."
They cooked with simple, whole foods that provided excellent nutrition and variety from recipes that were handed down from mother to daughter.
Simply Armenian allows us to cook like our grandmothers and provide the same healthy choices for our modern families
This story should have and COULD HAVE been really good.
It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted.
It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull.
I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it.
I can only praise Heinlein for including the "intelligent conversation" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn.
The whole story is just very odd.
Do read it though.
It's a title to read if you wish to be considered "well read."
Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from "To Kill A Mockingbird."
Skeleton Man is another success for Tony Hillerman.
The usual well-planned mystery to solve, and more about three of my favorite characters, Joe, Jim, and Bernie who appreciate the desert so much
Always think twice.
Never jump to hasty conclusions without considering ALL the effects of an act or decision.
That's the essence of Economics: "looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy."
Most economic fallacies are the result of ignoring this lesson, as Henry Hazlitt clearly shows with many examples throughout this witty short book.
Are there benefits in destruction (let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war?
Is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble?
Can taxes benefit the economy of a country?
Do inflationary policies really encourage a well-functioning economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions?
Are all labor union practices truly justified?
And, what about tariffs, subsidies, parity prices, rent control, or minimum wage laws?
These are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear, read, or see on the media.
Beyond what you may think about the government's role in the economy, whether you agree or not with the author's liberal views, "Economics in One Lesson" shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees.
As the author points out, half-truths presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies.
Demagogues and 'rogue' economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision (or, in the worst cases, on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action).
Learning to supplement and correct their half-truths with the other half is the most reasonable thing an independent thinker can do.
BTW, "Economics in One Lesson" might be a good place to start..
When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of Friedman's collumns in the Times.
I think Friedman is a great author with lots of great insights, but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as I would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments.
Since the sections are arranged chronologically, there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together.
If you really like Friedman, then it's worth a read, but if you are in it for just one, I'd read The Lexus and the Olive Tree first.
It is by far his best
Dobson has this to say about the supposed 'strong-willed child'.
"Even in infancy, he fairly bristles when his dinner is late and he insists that someone hold him during every waking hour.
Later, during toddlerhood, he declares total war on all forms of authority...his greatest thrill comes from drawing on the walls and flushing kitties down the toilet."
The "strong-willed child" has a "rampaging will."
It should be pointed-out that James Dobson's training is in Educational Psychology, NOT Child Psychology, OR Child Development.
I'm afraid he confuses 'strong-will' with anger, alienation, resentment, and contempt.
These are behaviors that are commonly produced in children as a result of his (and his ilk) approach toward child-rearing.
Like his right-wing christian compatriot, Ezzo, he would have parents believe that children are inherently evil.
The implicit advise is to beat the devil out of them.
This book is simply an ego boost for the author.
I found absolutely nothing I could use in my own business, but was vaguely impressed with the writers "word of mouth" business.
I kept reading, expecting to find the secrets to starting my own word of mouth campaign any minute, only to feel that final book readers frustration in the end.
No good ending, no secrets revealed, this book is a waste of time
In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005. from the very first page, the book had me hooked.
merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree.
in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.
everyone hates them and wants them gone.
merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house.
the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.
it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses.
I found this book very boring.
Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen.
Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American.
I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of
"The Last River - The Tragic Race for Shangri-la".......Tragic.
Yes I'd agree that this book is tragic.
Tragic that I bothered reading it.....tragic that I paid for it in order to read it.....tragic that Todd wasted his time writing it......tragic that I disliked it so much that I can be bothered writing a review.
The warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket.
"Advance praise for The Last River" it reads.
In retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it.
It seems that Todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be, and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal.
So much of the content has so little relevancy to the story, that you soon tire trawling through it.
This was my third Tsango experience.
I do recommend the Outside documentary on the Lindgren expedition.
"Hell or High Water" is not outstanding, but is worth a read, but on this book, my advise to Todd is please make this the Last River that you drag through the wringer
pppppppppp quot;I have received your new book against the human race, and thank you for it.
Never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid.
One longs, in reading your book, to walk on all fours.
But as I have lost that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it.
Nor can I embark in search of the savages of Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned render a European surgeon necessary to me; because war is going on in those regions; and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves.

Although Dead Soul begins quite decently and surprisingly for Doss, who has a tin ear for dialogue, dearly loves a cardboard character, and has no sense of plot, it rapidly and unsurprisingly disintegrates into a mangle of missed opportunities.
Since most plot reveals take place off scene, you have no idea what's going on until the end where Charlie tells all.
Is this supposed to create suspense?
Does Doss even realize how ridiculous this is?
Does he have an editor?
Can the editor read English?
Now these are real questions for Charlie to answer
Imagine you're attending a career enhancement seminar and suddenly you're doused with a giant bucket of ice cold water.
In essence, "Fire Your Boss" is just that.
Stephen Pollan's discourse on the stark realities of the real world of work shatter all the hyperbole and fluff of "careering" in not just corporate America but any occupational arena.
It's an easy, conversational and straightforward read that IMHO should be called "Hire Your Boss".
Pollan, a life coach with the style, chutzpah and hubris of a Donald Trump/Scott Adams hybrid, elaborates on the criticality of taking care of your number one customer in the microeconomic marketplace-your boss.
Pollan supports the essence of this approach with references to how the economic landscape has changed over the last few decades and how it's helped to perpetuate agency activity in organizations.
Simply put, managers will continue to act purely out of self-interest rather than an alignment with organizational objectives.
With this in mind, what will avail those of the non-management cadre the most is looking out for the needs of supervision, with more of a "hired gun" approach rather than that of a sycophant.
Many of Pollan's precepts will at first seem counterintuitive--such as "work for the money, the love will follow" or "lose your career, get a job" and may come across as trite and cynical.
However when taken in context the underlying schema is this: a job is a means of providing income-no more, no less.
Trying to find personal fulfillment therein is a recipe for self-destruction.
The author does a fine job of using the experiences of his clients to help illustrate these key concepts and concludes by offering a seven-step roadmap to help one achieve the empowerment and independence in the modern job market.
Although Pollan drives across some salient points about the contemporary world of work he does tend to oversimplify a bit with regards to some management behavior.
Furthermore, some of his coping strategies have the guise of tactics that only a New York Attorney could formulate.
Wait-Pollan IS a New York Attorney.
In sum, this is as an island of sanity in a sea of "Be a Star at Work" banter that perpetuates the dangling-carrot-over-the-sea-of-cubicles syndrome.
Finally, when you boil this down you realize that one as an employee should consider themselves self-employed.
I find it a good affirmation of what work really should be and a refreshing rebuttal to all the careering pundits whose success is predicated on the management's mystification of office life.
Not for the faint of heart!
The story was slow, predictable and boring.
I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.
It's a dud in my opinion
This book opened up new database opportunities for me.
Without it, I would never have unlocked the real power of MySQL 5
I am pretty sure that the author sent the only positive review.
That is pretty pathetic.
This book was written with no rhyme or reason.
There is no good progression of information or understandable sense to it all.
One star is stretch.
Plus, i am asian, and it was still hard for me-that is when you know it is bad
Videohound's Cult Flicks and Trash Pics is a book that I consult often.
Not only is it informative, but it's very entertaining reading as well.
This is a book that any cult movie lover should own.
If the names Roger Corman, Lloyd Kaufman, Ray Dennis Steckler, David Lynch, Frank Henenlotter, Jack Hill, Herschel Gordon Lewis, Dario Argento, Paul Bartel, Russ Meyer, Terry Gilliam, Alex Cox, Edward D. Wood, Ken Russell, George Romero and John Waters mean anything to you then you need this book.
In addition to reviews of hundreds and hundreds of cult films, the book has lengthy bios of many of the above filmmakers as well as actors and other important cult figures.
Plus there are tons of photos, there's a big specific category index to help you find exactly what you're looking for and indexes for actors, directors and writers.
One of my favorite features is that nearly every page features a quote from one of the movies featured in the book.
This is a great book though it's far from complete.
Lots of movie geeks will be able to look through the book and point out any number of movies that were left out.
However, for every movie you know of that's not in the book there are probably five that you've never heard of.
I recommend Cult Flicks and Trash Pics very highly
In a world desperate for health solutions, the uneducated masses flock to purported cures and aids that have not met the tests of either scientific or medical validity.
Alkaline water is one of those potholes that the unsuspecting customer encounters.
Careful research of this book and related topics finds that the real reason alkaline water is popular is that in pregnant Oriental women, it is believed that the use of alkaline water increases the probablility of a boy rather than a girl being born.
Hence the seven(7) percent utilization of this water in that part of the world.
Elsewhere, mycocardia problems with controlled animal tests using alkaline water have been known since 1996 but are suspiciously avoided by the Japanese organizations which promote alkaline water.
Common sense nutrition tells us that if one is concerned about acidic food intake, then the use of alkaline foods with alkaline fibre and neutral pH liquid is the answer.
Alkaline promoters would have you dilute your sensitive blood pH with high alkalinity thus inducing hematological problems which may put you in the emergency room as my medic(1985 Nobel Prize recipient) clearly points out.
You might as well drink battery acid he said, the result will be the same stress on your blood pH.
Here is a medic who is not an expert in water but in internal medicine cautioning against forced dilution of blood pH.
He continued by saying that when that much alkalinity is added to the digestive system, the very low pH which naturally occurs in the disgestive tract is neutralized and food is not metabolized properly.
The various amino acids which are essential in the metabolic process are no longer effective and food putrifies and nutrition suffers.
The alkaline promoters, including this book's author have been sniffing glue in a closed closet and are simply out of touch with even the very basics of body chemistry and metabolic processes.
Read the book for entertainment and not for education and utility in your daily nutritional program
A moving and inspiring portrait of men most people will never know about but will always be remembered by those touched by their deeds and courage in places we don't remember much anymore.
I am thankful for the sacrifice they made so I could freely write this
I'm a little late in reading this book.
I am trying to pace myself between the movies and the books so that I can enjoy a little Harry Potter at least every year.
I think Goblet of Fire is the best in the series, so naturally it would be pretty difficult for Phoenix to live up to that standard.
In Goblet, it feels like Rowling had a fantastic ending in mind, and that drove the writing of the story.
In Phoenix, it seems like the story is key and the ending was simply tacked on to round it out and provide some concluding information.
The major theme seemed to be the Ministry's takeover of Hogwarts.
I found that entire thread to be thoroughly engrossing.
Harry's dreams, however, took on sub-plot status, and then rose to the top for the final conflict.
I didn't mind the length of the book, but it did seem to drag in a couple of places.
The gang spent too much time at Grimmauld Place.
I could have also done without Hagrid's giant story.
My biggest problem with the book was Dumbledore's secrecy.
Good stories have real roadblocks to keep the hero from achieving his/her goal.
In Phoenix, the cause for most of the confusion was that Dumbledore was reluctant to share certain information with Harry.
He explains his behavior in a most unconvincing way in the final pages.
The secrecy was necessary for the story to take the course that it did, but it lacked good motivation and left me feeling let down.
It reminded me of the natural disaster movie template where the world could be easily saved if not for an arrogant bureaucrat who refuses to listen to the young upstart with all the answers.
It is contrived conflict that is hardly believable.
Don't get me wrong.
I love the Harry Potter series.
And, perhaps my expectations have risen too high.
I am eagerly awaiting the movie and then I know I will devour book 6 (when I allow myself to read it).
I lose interest in most book series after the first couple of installments.
Harry Potter always leaves me wanting more
I like looking at old pictures and old letters, but I thought when I bought the book that I would actually be looking in the history of someone's life with pictures to go with it but that was not the case.
It is just a random bunch of pictures and a random bunch of letters put together in a book.
The pictures aren't necessarily the pictures of the people who wrote the letters, so you know nothing of the authors, no explanation of the times they lived in or the place they lived in or anything.
In other words, no story behind it whatsoever.
Just a disappointing collection
I have long been aware of the commercial success of author Nora Roberts but the storylines and writing style (a genre often characterized as romantic suspense with apparent emphasis on the romance) have never tempted me to read any of her work.
However, I happened to pick up a copy of volume #21 (depending on how you count anthology inclusions) in the ....
IN DEATH series written under the pen name J.D.
Robb and was immediately intrigued by its premise of a futuristic police procedural series (the year is 2058) with a strong central character (Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas) who had a continuing romantic interest (the mysterious Irish billionaire Roarke).
I have long enjoyed the Spenser series by Robert Parker and the ensemble cast of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novels; the reward of finding another such series to enjoy would only be increased by some speculation thrown into the mix regarding the future direction of science in the aid of police work as well as speculation concerning the evolution of New York City, an area very familiar to me.
I was immediately hooked by SURVIVOR IN DEATH and despite some minor criticisms gave it a five star review (3/30/2005).
I read ORIGIN IN DEATH, the next book in the series, as soon as it was released and also enjoyed it sufficiently to rate it five stars as well (7/26/2005).
As with other series which I have enjoyed, I then decided to read some of the earlier books to fill in the backstory and see how the characters have evolved.
In my opinion, the early stories in the series can best be labeled transition novels as romance author Roberts attempts to transform herself into mystery writer Robb.
My recent three star review (11/29/2005) of NAKED IN DEATH, the initial book in the series, discusses the specific positives and negatives of that attempt, so I will not go into detail again here.
And in summary, I found this book a much better police procedural although with the major flaw that it seemed a little too obvious that Eve's pursuit of her initial suspect (although logical) would turn out to be a diversion from her identification of the real killer.
I so greatly enjoyed Susan Ericksen's audio rendition (unabridged CD) of that book that I also chose to listen to the audio version of this novel; I highly recommend her narration as likely to add to your enjoyment of the story.
A wonderfully apt Dryden quotation concerning fame and death opens this story; then Lt. Eve Dallas is discovered at the scene of a shocking homicide.
Prosecuting Attorney Cicely Towers, a powerful and widely recognized star in the District attorney's office and a woman with whom Eve has dealt on occasion, has been found with her throat brutally slashed in a nasty neighborhood far from her office and her home late one night.
The final appointment in her datebook is for an earlier dinner with her good friend and long time lover George Hammett; Eve quickly establishes that she arrived safely home and subsequently received a mystery call of which she made no record but which obviously drew her to the scene of her death.
Eve's investigation is complicated by the close friendship of Cicely's ex-husband Marco Angelini and their adult children (David and Marina) with her boss, Commander Whitney and his increasing concern as Eve's investigation concentrates on the family.
Eve discovers that both David Angelini and Marina's fiance Randall Slade have financial problems which could provide a motive for murder; as additional damaging background information surfaces she appears to be on a collision course with Whitney's understandable concern both for these children who have suffered the tragic loss of their mother; in addition, the stress increases when it appears that the friendship Whitney's wife with the family may lead to her potential involvement as a material witness.
Finally, a further complication which brings into question Dallas' objectivity is the revelation that the Angelini family, Cicely Towers and Eve's lover Roarke are are partners in a business venture.
Additional murders soon occur which bear the signature trademark of the killer, and media pressure intensifies on Eve given the visible lack of progress in her investigation and the antipathy which she has evoked in C.J.
Morse, who coanchors the evening news with her friend Nadine Furst.
Eve is infuriated by C.J.
's actions and yet knows that in fact the only effective way to silence the slimeball's continual attempts to denigrate her investigatory skills during his broadcasts is identify and catch the murderer.
Meanwhile, Eve is also involved in establishing the boundaries in her relationship with Roarke, both with regard to their personal lives and when his aid might be appropriate in her police investigation.
After several twists, including one diversion which I had not anticipated, the story suddenly rockets towards a violent climax which it is not clear that all the central characters will survive.
In addition to Roarke, Commander Whitney, Lt. Dallas, and reporter Nadine Furst, this story contains all the series characters introduced in the first volume including Dr. Mira and the unique irrepressible Mavis Freestone and Summerset, all of whom play relatively minor roles in this narrative.
Finally, the reader is introduced to Patrol(wo)man Peabody, whose observational skills in her relatively minor role in this case commend her to Eve.
She will eventually become both Eve's good friend and partner on subsequent cases and their complementary styles and skills will combine with their dedication to speaking for the dead and their loved ones will serve them well.
If you plan to read several volumes of the series, I strongly suggest that you start with NAKED IN DEATH and then read this book even though they are inferior to the two later books which I have read.
The later books include details concerning the mysteries of Roarke's and Dallas' childhood backgrounds and the impact on their individual lives which provide a context that I would have preferred to have gradually unfold as I completed the series in the sequence which the author intended.
And certainly, if you want a romance/detective story then read NASKED IN DEATH.
While this book still had some steamy sequences much more typical of Nora Robert's novels than the later stories in this sequence, they were much more infrequent and better integrated into the story.
However, if you only plan to sample a few stories in the series, then I strongly suggest that you skip the early books and concentrate on some of the later novels, including either of the two which I mention at the beginning of this review.
The characters and their relationships are much more developed as the series progresses and the plots are also more complex.
Meanwhile, I plan to continue to pursue the dual goal of reading each of the new releases as they occur while gradually filling in my knowledge of Dallas' past cases.

Carl Hiaasen, who pens a weekly column for The Miami Herald, certainly follows the adage "Write what you know."
While he occasionally covers nationally significant events, Hiaasen generally confines his writings to the fertile territory that is the state of Florida.
Readers of Hiaasen's columns know well his passions and viewpoints.
His sarcastic commentaries often take aim at such topics as the medical profession, land developers, crooked politicians, gun aficionados, tobacco companies, madcap theme parks and the destruction of Florida's environment.
But weekly newspaper pieces are not the end of Hiaasen's caustic observations --- they are only the beginning.
In 10 novels written over a span of 20 years, Hiaasen has expanded upon all of these topics in hilarious tales that poke fun at every aspect of life in the Sunshine State.
NATURE GIRL is Hiaasen's 11th novel.
While he skewers many familiar targets, there are a few new objects of ridicule for his skillful and entertaining writing.
Hiaasen's Florida romps all share common traits: quirky plots, countless screwball characters and an irreverent style that creates laughter on every page.
The prime target for his ire in NATURE GIRL is Boyd Shreave, a telemarketer pitching Florida real estate who places a sales call to Honey Santana, thereby setting in motion a chain of events familiar to any Hiaasen aficionado.
Anyone who has experienced the pain of a telemarketing call interrupting a quiet and peaceful evening at home can identify with Santana's plot of revenge.
She turns the tables on Shreave and lures the unsuspecting pitchman to Florida for a phony tour of nonexistent Florida property.
NATURE GIRL begins with an event not uncommon in a Hiaasen novel: someone dies and someone else tries to dispose of the body.
Sammy Tigertail, a fugitive half-breed Seminole, takes a tourist out on his airboat.
The tourist is frightened by a harmless water snake and dies of an apparent heart attack.
Panic-stricken, Sammy decides to ditch the body somewhere in the Ten Thousand Islands area of Southeast Florida.
The cast of characters, as often occurs in a Hiaasen novel, expands exponentially.
Shreave has a wife intent on divorce, along with a girlfriend who accompanies Shreave on his ostensible Florida vacation.
Eugenie Fonda once achieved fame as the girlfriend of a tabloid murderer.
While Santana is obsessed with her plot to destroy Shreave, she must also fend off the advances of a stalker known only to readers as Mr. Piejack and her drug-running former husband Perry.
Add to the mix one Florida State co-ed who falls in love with Sammy Tigertail and a private investigator hired by Shreave's wife to follow him on his tryst with Eugenie, and the pieces to a puzzle that create a picture of hilarity are almost all in place.
Carl Hiaasen is a genius in creating mayhem on the pages of his novels.
Characters move in all directions across Florida, and readers may often have difficulty keeping track of their various escapades.
In the end, however, everything comes together in a typical Hiaasen conclusion.
NATURE GIRL is pure Hiaasen, and his many readers once again will experience the joy of his humor and his easily recognized and human characters.

Tony Judt's "Postwar - A History of Europe Since 1945" is the well researched material from a British conservative born 1948 in London and educated at Cambridge and Paris on political, social and economic developments in Europe following World War II.
Steeped in information about little understood countries, the book would be a great read for non-Europeans interested in how the continent recovered from the war, especially in East Germany, the Balkans, and the Eastern Europe countries that were strongly influenced by the USSR.
The book makes the point, that without the threat of the USSR in Eastern Europe, the US isolationist might have prevailed, which would have adversely influenced the recovery of West Germany, and Communism might not have collapsed so quickly.
Although the book is relativly easy to read, its 800 plus pages are peppered with little over-the-top clauses that add about 200 unnecessary pages to the work.
Nevertheless, as non-professional historian, I would rank the book slightly under 5 stars.
Of all the articles and books of Chomsky that I have read, Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies is without doubt the most exhaustively researched (and footnoted), the most logically structured, and the most convincing.
Chomsky reminds us that the majority of the populace rely on the various media institutions for their information about political affairs; both domestic and foreign.
One can only hold an opinion on a topic if one knows about the topic.
So take, for example, the popular myth of the 'persistent Soviet vetoe' at the UN during the cold war.
Why do people believe the USSR was constantly vetoeing any and every Security Council Resolution?
Simple!
When they did, it generated front page condemnation.
When the US or the UK exercised their right of veteo: silence.
As Chomsky notes, during the years of 1970 and 1989 the former Soviet Union veteod 8 resolutions.
The US veteod some 56.
This is what Chomsky refers to as Thought Control.
Unless the public examine the factual record of the UN themselves, they will never come by this information, (at least not in the mainstream press).
So although Chomsky's title may appear somewhat paradoxical, or oxymoronic, a moments reflection on such facts shows it to be, in fact, extremenly pragmatic and truthful.
The question is, have you the honesty and sheer guts to question yourself and challenge the information which has contributed to your beliefs?
The crux of Chomsky's argument is that propaganda is to a democracy what violence is to a dictatorship.
Chomsky points out that, in fact, propaganda is, contrary to popular postulations, more important and vital to a democratic society because people still have some rights.
That is, since people can talk, the powers that be must ensure that only the correct words come out of the peoples' mouths.
In a dictatorship it does not really matter too much what people think; for whatever they may think, they have to do what they are told, by pain of death.
In countries such as the US (and the UK) other, more subtle, methods are required.
People often critisise Chomsky for the sources of his information (the copious footnotes).
No such critique can be levelled at this work.
Chomsky's sources are declassified internal planning documents, naval proceedings documents, and the very institutions he examines, New York Times, Washington Post etc.
If there was one Chomsky book I would suggest you to read, this would be it
The monographs lack any sort of scientific references.
A true reference manual should list references so the reader can verify the conclusions made
I loved this book!
I picked it up on a whim at the airport, and couldn't put it down for the entire flight.
Now I'm telling all my friends to get it.
Not only does it have tips about playing cards, but it's just a flatout pageturning thriller.
You keep wondering where this guy's life is going to lead him next.
Very suspenseful and funny too.
Highly recommended.
I agree with one the comments posted below.
The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him.
Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10.
I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.
Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.
Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time
I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.
My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.
I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.
When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.
Neither panned out.
This book is boring.
The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.
Too much detail and not enough substance.
Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it
I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.
So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates.
For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the "shrink" bashers of the world.
This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me
Hank Hanegraff is a blatant replacement theologian where the nation of Israel is concerned.
He is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups, to include pretribulationists.
Indeed, his "scholarship" is no scholarship at all; it is pure propaganda.... To see real scholarship, get Tim Cohen's materials (see below): Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, Zola Levitt, Thomas McCall, John Hagee, Grant Jeffrey, Marlin Maddox, Perry Stone, Texe Marrs, John Walvoord (deceased), etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.
The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.
These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.
Why continue to be deceived?
Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.
Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".
If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's site for details on these items, which are also available via Amazon)
The mysterious oriental mirror is ugly, and it has powers that wield themselves on the unexpected.
It wreaks havoc and sometimes kills, as is the case with several people in this book.
The rest are either thought mad or driven mad.
Question: If you could, would you switch places with somebody else in a different time?
I think I might, but I would like to be given a choice.
Brandy McCabe and her granddaughter Shay Garrett aren't given that choice.
Both are 20 years old and about to marry men neither love when the mirror transports them into each other's bodies.
Marlys Millhiser has woven a complex and fascinating story of culture shock in which Brandy becomes her granddaughter and Shay becomes her grandmother.
Shay is thought crazy in the early 1900s because she can tell the future, and she keeps a diary to tell her grandmother how she has lived out her life should she return to her own body one day.
Her story and how she deals with a pre-citified Boulder, Colorado is the most interesting segment of the book, but I didn't feel sorry for Shay as much as I admired her strength of character.
She also had her mother's stories of her ancestors to go on, but this was not the case for poor Brandy.
The Garrett's and Shay's fiancee' don't know what to do with a pregnant Shay who is terrified and clueless about the year 1978, but they know after discovering the diary that she really is Brandy.
The story is often heartbreaking, often times quite funny, and there are so many supporting and unforgettable characters--like the lovable Thora K., Brandy's first mother-in-law and the old man who takes care of Shay when she runs away from her family--that this book is not only compelling, but also makes you think about your own place in this world.
What Shay and Brandy do have in common is Rachel, Brandy's daughter and Shay's mother.
Now picture those two being in each other's place when you think of that!
Somebody here called the book a literary classic; I wouldn't go that far, but it is excellent, regardless.
The Mirror is magical storytelling any way you look at it, so let it weave it's spell on you.
When I first started reviewing children's books on Amazon.com I gave myself a long list of rules to follow.
And one of those rules stated that I was not to read other reviews of a book on the site until AFTER I'd written my own review.
I wanted my little writings to remain unsullied and pure, filled only with my own thoughts (which I obviously mistook to be brilliant) and feelings.
After a while though I gave up on this rule.
By and large (and this is not speaking for all reviews... just 90% of them) a review for a children's book goes something along the lines of "It was good, my four-year-old requests it every night, buy this book, etc.".
Nothing too shocking or revealing.
So I grew lazy.
I started reading other reviews of picture books long before I sat down to actually write a review of my own.
Just moments ago I went to do the same thing for the beautiful picture book, "Martin's Big Words".
This book was on my list of must-reads because it had garnered itself a Caldecott Honor years before.
So I went to the appropriate Amazon.com page (much as you are now) and read the first review on the list.
At the time, it was an unassuming July 18, 2002 review entitled, "There's Something Wrong Here...".
I read the review.
I digested the review.
And I came to the inescapable opinion that the points raised in the review were good ones.
Ones that I should consider, dare I say, in my OWN review.
This is unprecedented.
Never has a review for a book, a children's book, really hit home for me like this one did.
So to that mysterious reader who thought to make a point back in 2002, I commend you.
And to myself, a mental whipping for breaking my own rules.
It's a hard act to follow, but I've a point or two of my own to make and I'm gonna make `em.
Now as a children's librarian I get a whole heaping helpful of small children coming in around January 17th (or just before) requesting books on Martin Luther King Jr. For the older children, such requests are usually easy enough to fulfill.
But for little ones with short attention spans and even shorter vocabularies, the choices are limited.
Fortunately, there's, "Martin's Big Words".
A beautiful encapsulation of the life of the great man, the book shows Martin as a child, first encountering the insanity of segregation.
We see him grow up and preach a gospel of love and acceptance.
Following this are small looks at the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, civil rights marches, and his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize.
Finally, while marching with striking garbage collectors (a fact not often mentioned in children's biographies of King), he was shot and killed.
Says the book at the end, "His big words are alive for us today".
The book is stunning to look at, you know.
The endpapers consist of pane after pane of brown, peach, amber, and umber stained glass.
Taken together, the stained glass appears to be a variety of different skin tones all working together to make something beautiful.
Using collage, illustrator Bryan Collier peppers his unique style with symbolic images (such as four lit candles placed in remembrance of the girls killed in the Sixteenth Street Baptist church).
In the rest of the book, Collier's images leap off the page.
They're bright, colorful and eclectic.
Combined with author Doreen Rappaport's elegant eloquent narrative, children get a full understanding of the courage and greatness behind Dr. King's life and actions.
So what about the complaints of this book?
Let's examine them fully.
First of all, one criticism is that in the image of the civil rights march there are thirteen men on display, none of whom are either white or female.
This is true.
And it is a little odd.
Not don't-buy-this-book odd.
Just why-did-the-illustrator-make-that-choice odd.
From looking at the picture I can only assume that Collier was working off a snapshot of a portion of a march from the past and didn't notice that it was a bit skewed.
The other criticism of the book is that whites are only portrayed as evil rednecks that want to kill Dr. King.
I dunno.
The book says plenty of things about diversity and the coming together of the races.
As for the lack of positive white images, I admit they're not present in this particular book.
However, the world is filled to overflowing with books that DO present positive images of white people.
As a white person myself, I'm sick to death of 'em.
And I'd gladly exchange four or five hundred such books for a single one that was half as beautifully illustrated and written as "Martin's Big Words".
So yeah, the book has a flaw here or there.
But it also fills a need.
However important you deem it that your children see positive images of whites during the Freedom Marches is your prerogative.
But don't pass "Martin's Big Words" by because it fails to fully display the diversity of the 60s in your eyes.
It's a great book with a great message.
It's also one of the few King bios that'll capture your seven-year-old's attention for longer than a minute.
A great addition to any library and a necessary purchase for anyone who wants to teach their small child about a magnificent man.
Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques Nicolae Carpathia continues his reign of terror over the world, destroying any who dare to oppose him.
Followers of Carpathianism suffer one indignity after another with their water supply being turned to blood and their bodies breaking out in hideous boils and sores.
Angels of God appear to believers all over the world to encourage them and keep their faith strong.
The tribulation Force continues to resist Carpathia as they prepare for what is expected to come... the ultimate desecration of the Church by the false god.
This story started to pick up again after the two previous books failed to keep this reviewer's interest, who was glad to discover that continued determination to read the whole series was worth it.
There are more examples in this installment of what attracted millions to the Left Behind series.
Characters continue along the lines drawn for them by their personalities, with readers taking pleasure in experiencing the continued adventures along with the Trib Force and Tsion Ben Judah.
However, be forewarned, the culmination of certain characters' individual stories will make readers sit up and shout "What the heck was that?"
or "THAT is what happens to them?"
The story continues with plenty of adventure for the players and the natural progression of their faith... or lack thereof.
Desecration will captivate readers enough to make them hold on to find out what will happen next.

Marvelous story with historical concepts and involment leading the reader to intrigue and fascination.
Buy this book.
OK, i can't deny it, this book was well written.
But what made me throw up is the age differance, i mean what the hell!
how can Tana like someone who's 30 years older than her?
that's aweful!
this is what i really hate about Dan's books, she hooks someone who's 20 with some1 who's 35. i don't find that interesting.
all i can say about full circle is that it's good but so depressing.
it made me cry( which proves that Danielle is a good writer) don't read this book if you are not ready to get depressed
I am agreeing to the comment of "E for effort" on this book.
This book describes the author's attemps to improve his condition and how he suceeded.
But he admits in his book that he is not sure which ones actually worked.
Plus, the author also takes diabetes medications, along with other medicines and supplements.
My main concern is what worked for him probably won't work for someone reading this book.
This book does not really provide a clear picture on what to do.
He made so many changes on the medications and supplements, it is hard to say what worked.
One can find the general imformation presented in this book on "Diet", "Exercise" and "Stress management" (relating to clog arteries pppppppppp heart diseases) through the internet.
I didn't gain any new information by reading this book.
The printing of this book is also done in a very strange way.
The text is printed at the center, occupying only the center area with a lot of spaces around, so about half of the page is blank.
I really liked Suzanne Summers.
I've read all her other books and have her tai chi exercise video.
When I saw her on the Today show advertising this book I couldn't wait to get it.
She promotes the Schwarzbein Principle which states that being a vegetarian is unhealthy.
Suzanne has an entire chapter dedicated to someone named Wendy who after 10 years of being a vegetarian was convinced to start eating meat again!
Just because Wendy's particular diet was unhealthy, that doesn't mean that all vegetarians are unhealthy.
There are meat eaters that have unhealthy diets.
Look at all the Hindus in India, they're lifetime vegetarians and are healthy.
I know that soy has been a controversial subject recently, but it's the pill form of soy that is questionable, soy it it's natural form is healthy for you.
How can you say that soy is bad for you when millions of East Asians eat soy as part of their daily diet?
I've read countless books and research that supports the benefits of soy.
I eat a balanced vegetarian diet and get all the nutrients my body needs.
Just because one doctor doesn't believe that a vegetarian diet is healthy, doesn't make it a fact.
Suzanne you've really gone too far to tell everyone to stop being a vegetarian.
With that misinformation in your book, I have a hard time believing that anything else is true and fact.
Oz talks sense.
From the first chaper, I was hooked.
She suggested making a minor change for the first week.
I cut back on one soft drink per day - from 3 down to 2.
That was quite painless.
I also took her starter tips - drink water before meals and don't eat closer than 2 hours before bedtime.
Again, those were minor and didn't crimp my style.
This is not really a diet book though it deals with diet (as in what you eat).
It's really about living well and making mostly good choices but not going overboard (and ultimately failing).
Oz is a vegetarian, but she said that red meat was fine in moderation.
Go for only twice per week on that she suggested.
I love beef, but I also like chicken and fish and can tweak that part of my meal plan.
Chips are junk food, but a bowl isn't a huge deal.
Just don't grab the bag and keep munching.
If you have an urge for chocolate, melt some semi-sweet chocolate and dip fruits like strawberries in the chocolate.
It really does satisfy that chocolate craving with smaller amounts of chocolate.
That's typical of her advice and things that I can handle and maintain.
She also talks about exercise and about supplements (meant to supplement and not take the place of good food).
She's reasonable with her ideas here as well.
I added some extra work out time (even jogging 5 minutes while watching TV adds up if you do it pretty often) and bought a basic vitamin plus B, C and E (all heartily approved by my doc).
Oz lost 10 pounds her first semester.
This is not a crash course.
She's down 30 lbs now (over 2 years I think) - just slowly and surely.
And, she's maintained rather than yo-yo'ing.
I think most people (college or not) would benefit from reading this book and trying out Oz's common sense plan.
Older readers might need a little less food overall and might not opt to go out and have a snowball fight to burn calories, but the basics are here for a good lifestyle plan that isn't painful and does work.
This would be a great book for anyone (females more so) headed off to college or in college.
Oz has dealt with being overweight.
She did a lot of research and put a workable plan into action.
I think most readers will love her style and also will be able to use her ideas and stay slimmer and healthier.
don't buy this book, no substance only good for sale
Owen does a remarkable job of making himself look like a complete jerk.
He comes off as arrogant, showing little empathy towards Debra's problems earlier on in their marriage ( eating disorder, depression, social anxiety).
He writes about very private matters in his book that have nothing to do with the legal trouble Debra was in, but instead are very embarrassing to her.
He comes across as a husband with no compassion.
It's ironic that he goes on and on about Debra's poor choices in boyfriends over the years, and how they were always so controlling of her....and then he goes on to tell us how mad he was because he was a tidy person and Debra didn't keep the house tidy...and he didn't approve of the way she dressed!!
Seems to me that he was no different than the other guys she dated.
He repeatedly reminds us of how smart he is, his GPA, jobs, earning potential, etc...but then admits that when they separated, he sticks Debra with the credit card bill that still had a balance from their wedding and honeymoon to pay off!
He says it was in her name, so she can have it!
Owen shows how little a man he really is in this book.
Debra did have horrible things happen to her as a kid, and maybe if she could have married a man with compassion in his heart, she wouldn't have gone down the road she did.
I feel very sorry for Debra after reading this book
We have to do better than this for our children.
Controlling and turning your kid into the perfect little, well behaved lemming is going to haunt you until you die.
This type of abuse never has a good, long term effect on anyone.
Put the paddles and belts down and talk to your kids.
They deserve at least that much.
With respect to my qualifications, I am the founder of the Learning Spanish Like Crazy method.
I am also the author of several articles written on the topic of learning Spanish.
And now for my review .
.
.
I tend to judge a Spanish-English Dictionary by the following criteria: 1.
Does it provide 21st Century Spanish vocabulary words or only outdated Spanish vocabulary?
2.
Does it provide BOTH the words that are commonly used in Latin America AND Spain or only one or the other?
Using yardstick number one this book did fairly well.
I found words such as "raton" not only defined as "mouse" as in the rodent but also "mouse" as in "computer mouse."
And "pantalla" wasn't only defined as a "screen" but a a 'computer monitor' as well.
However, it only used the original definition of "bajar" (to lower, to descend, or to go down).
It lacked the 21st century definition which is "to download."
Using yardstick number two, this dictionary did well.
For the English word "block" I found the Latin American definition of "cuadra" but I also found the European definition of the word which is "manzana."
Several Spanish-English dictionaries that I have used in the past only define the Spanish word "manzana" as the English word "apple," and only define the English word "block" as the Spanish word "cuadra."
It is important that a dictionary provides both the Latin American and European Spanish words.
From my experience, Latin Americans tend to use different vocabulary words from one country to another.
But if you use the European Spanish word, even though they may not use the word, they will be familiar with it and will understand you.
Overall, I give this dictionary "cuatro estrellas" (four stars).
Don't waste your money on this book.
I will finish the book because it is our book club choice.
The characters are shallow and self centered.
The writing is middle school quality.
Kris Radish seems to have an agenda she is pushing and she was going to get it all into this book come hell or high water.
No poetry and no beauty, I could care less about the women in this book.
Who could possibly think life's problems could be solved by walking away from them while drinking lots of wine?
I treasure my sisters and women friends but I wouldn't want to be a friend to any of these women.
I would give it no stars if I could
Engrossing and amusing travelogue by world's crankiest traveler.
Some people really hate Theroux, accusing him of snobbery, self importance, and bigotry.
I can certainly see why some readers wouldn't be able to deal with his style and opinions, but I must say that this volume might be a pretty good litmus test of readers' tolerance for the author's travel works.
(If you can enjoy this one, you'll probably enjoy his other non-fiction works).
I, for one, totally enjoyed hearing about grunge-y has-been towns, obnoxious holiday camps, and seedy hotels.
To me, the book was a real page-turner, and he writes so vividly of scenery.
I felt he wrote about the worst bits of his trip with true humor, reminding us travelers that it's helpful to keep a sense of humor during the rough times.
I felt the book was a pretty decent scouting report for the island's shoreline, and I now know what to avoid there.
I can definitely thank Theroux and his fussy standards!
If you like Theroux, it's a good bet you'll love this one.
As the reviewer from Jackhorn, KY stated, this book lacks original research.
If you read the section on the "house church movement" and then go to the website for The Homechurch Homepage, you will see that Mr. Wolfe hacked away at many of the articles on the site to obtain his "research."
For the many quotes he used from the website, not once were any of the authors contacted by Mr. Wolfe in order to do any original research.
If he had done so, he would have come away with a different take than he wrote in his book
I recommend that most people do NOT read this book.
If you choose to ignore me and you read the work anyway, please first be remotely acquainted with and keep in mind a few things before you attempt to do so (and certainly before you try to express an ostensibly reputable opinion on Amazon): **magical realism**; Jewish history, religion, culture and humor(although the last is perhaps redundant); memory; folk lore; the English language; love; the nature of histories; sex; death; pain; narrative style and voice; the multiplicity of human, and likewise Jewish, experience; imagination.
I will assert, because I hope it is true, that you don't need to all of these things to enjoy "Illuminated," but you do need to be familiar with some of it.
And you must be willing to spend some time with this book to enjoy it.
All those with self-diagnosed A.D.D.
need not bother cracking the spine.
However, even if you qualify despite the rigor of what may be required of you, everything may be indeed sadly "obfuscated."
Or perhaps less disappointingly, only partly obfuscated.
If so, don't get angry.
Don't curse the gods or creative writing programs.
And certainly, if you are going to write bad reviews on Amazon, preface it first with your own faults as a reader.
Lastly, buck up.
Read another book.
Even the Bible (another little book high up on the best seller's list) is not for everyone.
And for those of you out there who disagree to my approach with this review of "Illuminated", that is fine.
Dismiss it.
At least, please don't take the advice of any other critic here who speaks in an equally perturbed voice.
Moreover, don't read it for the reviews...Actually stop reading reviews.
Now
This book reads like the blog of some angry person who ignores evidence to the contrary and embraces anything that agrees with him.
It was very hard to take seriously
pppppppppp #65279;Millennials Rising is the latest book in the generational series by the authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, focusing this time on the generation born after X.
For those not already familiar with the authors' theory, Strauss and Howe are two authors who began writing about generations in 1991.
They wrote the book Generations, which introduced a theory that generations fall into four re-cycling types, and each type comes of age during a different kind of era, or "turning".
The Silent Generation is of the "adaptive" type, for instance, passive, gentle, and in tune with their emotions, and came of age during the Golden Age of postwar America.
The Baby Boomers, remembered for their "Awakening" in the 1960s, are of the "idealist" type, concerned with God and spirituality and impassioned about what they believe in, but inclined to change during life (from hippie to the current "Just say no" control freak).
Generation X, which they named the Thirteenth Generation, is of the "reactive" type, being alienated, street-smart and materialistic, without a feeling of need to be "loyal" to anything, coming of age during the 1980s and 1990s.
They then first identified everyone born since 1982 as the "Millennial Generation", and predicted back in 1991 that it would be grow up to be optimistic, hard-working and clean-cut, just like the G.I.
Generation that fought World War II, going back to the "civic" type generation before the Silent Generation.
In 1993 they published the book Thirteenth Gen, which specialized in Generation X and why they are the way they are.
In their third book, The Fourth Turning, they went back to the whole theory and writing about all the generations.
They also changed the archetype names from adaptive, idealist, reactive and civic to Artist, Prophet, Nomad and Hero.
Strauss and Howe wrote in this book about an upcoming era of epic battle and mass destruction, much like the one in which the G.I.
Generation came of age.
They then predicted the Millennial Generation would form the role of Heroes during the coming crisis, and they would lower teen pregnancy rates, stop using drugs, serve the United States, in uniform even, and desist with using profanity.
So then in 2000 they put out this book, Millennials Rising.
In this one the authors try to explain the Millennial Generation (my generation).
Millennials Rising attempts to identify who we, the most ethnically diverse generation in American history as they note, are.
In Millennials Rising they write about this generation's Boomer parents and their influence on the Millennial Generation, as well as the kind of world in which this generation is growing up (which S pppppppppp H think of as hundreds of television channels, SUV lifestyles, rappers who swear, and people who smack each other on TV).
The book states that Millennials want to work together in teams, believe the people in authority know more about right and wrong than they do, are enthusiastic about learning and going to school, are loved and protected by their parents, achieve great things in school and will achieve great things in the future, and lest we forget, always want to exude that "positive peer pressure" on their fellow Millennials.
The obviously leads to the question, then, is the generation really optimistic, hard-working and clean-cut just as they say?
Consider this: Only 28% of high school seniors say that the work they get assigned at school is "meaningful", only 21% describe their courses as "interesting" and still barely over a third, 39%, believe that what they do in school will have any relation to their success later in life.
The generation was supposed to be enthusiastic about learning.
The Millennial Generation also rapidly increased drug use, especially pot, from the level at which Generation X was using them in its teens, as even the authors themselves note.
S pppppppppp H portray the world of edgy entertainment, such as television shows, movies and music, as a Zoroastrian battle.
In popular music, for instance, artists are described by extremes that either represent the alleged Millennial values or go actively against them -- on one side, artists like Eminem, Limp Bizkit and Marilyn Manson, on the other, boy bands and Britney Spears and her imitators, along with such second-tier bands as the S Club 7.
They do not deal with the Millennial interest in bands that lie somewhere in between the two.
For instance, Blink-182 is just about the biggest band around now, and yet Millennials Rising does not mention Blink-182 and the many young fans who make the band a success.
South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut is the authors' idea of where popular culture is today.
Millennials Rising heralds boy bands as what music will increasingly be like as the current decade unfolds, and blasts the "edgy" bands as groups that will be washed away, but could the authors have predicted bands like Good Charlotte or artists like Avril Lavigne?
This leads to the bigger question of whether the book and the theory will be able to predict anything.
S pppppppppp H write about "rebelling by being better" during the present decade.
Apparently, their idea of rebellion is not listening to Limp Bizkit, blasting censorship, or doing illegal drugs, but wearing preppy clothes, waiting until marriage to have sex, and trusting their government.
According to them, we should expect to see Millennials petitioning for policies that will punish their own peers.
S pppppppppp H write that we will accept the draft and join the military in great numbers when the crisis presents us with a war, and even do National Service.
Frankly, can anyone imagine any more than 20% of today's high school students doing their duty and risking their life in war in the name of America?
Also, our generation has done nothing to make a commitment to following Bush as leader during the Iraq War, while S pppppppppp H predict Millennials serving their president.
How suited to a Hero generation is that?
The G.I.
Generation followed FDR so blindly they had to print his campaign materials in Braille.
When it comes to rallying around their president and leading the direction of the nation during a crisis, Millennials have surely disappointed those who expected them to do just as the authors said we would.
This, of course, does not have to be a bad thing, but it does make you wonder about the limitations of the predictive abilities of the theory.
Some parts of it make for very interesting reading, but all the talk about how they are to be the "next great" generation gets to you sometimes.
S pppppppppp H seem to believe you can never think too big about those Millennials.
Millennials Rising presents an image of youth that is set to amaze you and will attract readers, but sometimes what the book describes just isn't happening
I'm usually a sucker for just about any kooky theories backed up by barely-there evidence.
Even trying very hard to be generous (hey, I'm a Christian and I think it would be fabulous if the stuff in this book were true), I think I could poke a hole in every page.
And that's after perhaps 12 months of formal Mandarin study and a similar amount of Cantonese.
Don't buy it.
It's embarrassing to Christians that this sort of thing gets passed around as scholarship.
If they'd wrapped it up with a plot around it, it'd make a great work of fiction
I liked TRACK OF THE CAT, but I didn't love it.
The idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one I found appealing, but the plot was, at times, predictable.
The setting was well-drawn, but most of the characters were pretty one-dimensional.
The clincher, though, is that I'm not sure yet just how captivating Anna Pigeon is as a main character.
I believe that this is her first story, so I don't want to make a snap judgement, but Anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple.
That would be expecting a lot, I know, but frankly she isn't even as engaging as, say, Gideon Oliver or Sharon McCone or Brother Cadfael, and she lacks the depth and power of a Harry Bosch.
As I said, the jury is still out for me here.
I liked TRACK OF THE CAT, but I wasn't wild about it.
It's a solid first try, and I'll certainly read another Anna Pigeon or two before deciding whether or not to go for the whole series.
I expect most readers will find this opening mystery enjoyable.
I recommend it, but my recommendation is a mild one
I am a huge Clyde Edgerton fan, and I'm sorry to say I was VERY disappointed with this book.
It just never seemed to get off the ground.
I was expecting the type of story that I fell in love with in *Raney* and *Walking Across Egypt* (both of which left me in tears, I laughed so hard).
If you're looking for Listre, you're not going to find it in this book Oh well, I guess I'll wait on his next one..
"Just Enough" is more than enough: A turgid, pretentious, strident, and wholly unoriginal piece of work.
Its framework neither breaks any new ground in the study of the sociology of business or organization behavior, nor is it a particularly useful addition to the realm of self-help pop-business literature.
At best, this might have been a reasonable ten page article in the Harvard Business Review, but surely not enough material for 280 pages!
Better to read pppppppppp quot;Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow : Discovering Your Right Livelihood, pppppppppp quot; by MARSHA SINETAR, and call it a day
As a Visual Arts student coming to terms with the whole conceptual ideology in contemporary art, I found this book an excellent choice for delving into the theoretical side of contemporary photgraphy.
This book is definitely not bedtime reading.
Trust me, I tried it and kept myself awake!
There is also an excellent reference to archives, journals and other books to peruse.
I found the book easy to understand and has helped me immensely in my quest to understand what constitutes Visual Art in current times.
An excellent choice for all those contemplating a Visual Arts career using photographic image
Why is S Douglas "Scotty" slamming every car sales book on Amazon but Zig Zigler's?
Do you work for Ziggy or maybe a friend and pushing this book for him.
Take a look at all of S. Douglas "Scotty" reviews concerning car sales.
He puts almost everyone of them down but praises Zigler's book.
What's up with that?
And then if you look at reviews from HARDLUCK It makes one wonder if he is selling a competitor's book on here because he is attacking books written by Douglas Hensley who is a really good writer.
It makes me wonder if (S. Douglas Scotty and Hardluck) are the same person or are possibly in cohoots together pushing people away from pretty good books.
Something stinks here.
I wish I had time to play on the web all day and put bogus reviews on people.
Something stinks in Denmark!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Having spent the last year in the Near East, I found that reading this book gave me an incite that was most helpful to me and my collegues.
While this book was written about the Isreal-Lebanon issue during the 1970's-1980's, though it just reared its ugly head once again in the last few months, it was as I said a great help to me to understand or at least better understand the arabic way of life and culture.
With the world attention squarely on the Near East we all, weather American, European, or other cultures throughout the world, need to know and understand the Near Eastern mentality, culture, and to some extend how the Islamic Religion plays into the everyday life and politics of that area.
With this book being written by a Jewish American and with Thomas Freidman's understanding of the Near East way of thinking gives the book a credibility others could only hope for.
I recommend this book to anyone that is a student of the Near East, Politicians and Military Personnel, Religious Leaders, and anyone who wants a better understanding of the Near East in general.
I bought this book because my mother is dying and I needed to know more.
Kessler has a wonderful way of delivering this knowledge.
He is thorough in imparting this knowledge and does so with total compassion for the dying and the living.
I underscored many passages in this work and especially appreciated someone telling me (chapter 8) what can I expect in the way of physical signs as mom goes through the dying process.
This book is very user friendly having a very readable quality.
I strongly recommend it
I checked out this cookbook from the library and as soon as I cracked it open I knew I needed a copy of my own.
It is full of simple, tasty, and easy to prepare recipes.
I really like how most of the recipes don't require many special ingredients and how simple the directions are.
I was a little apprehensive having made the decision to become a vegetarian but this cookbook gave me confidence I'd still be able to enjoy a flavorful variety of cuisine
..."First Grade Takes a Test pppppppppp #8221; is an excellent, multicultural book that should be in every elementary classroom, especially Kindergarten thru 3rd grades...For it pppppppppp #8217;s use in demonstrating that the really important things in life aren pppppppppp #8217;t measurable, and even as a tool for helping students understand and interpret poorly worded questions (and there will always be a handful of them on any standardized test), the book is invaluable.
Highly recommended from this early childhood teacher
Bill O'Reilly has a good reason for his massive paranoia: Somewhere, deep in the recesses of his brain, he knows something's wrong.
Only he's got it backwards: The "secular progressives" are doing just fine, but he's the one with the serious problem.
Here's a guy who had to pay millions of bucks to settle a sexual harassment suit; yet, he's proclaiming himself the arbiter of the correct, "traditional" point of view.
Only in an era of the stupid, undereducated and witless would Bill O'Reilly have a modest role to play.
Save your money
Whether you are new to dating, widowed or divorced and starting to date again, or in your 50th year of marriage - you will be able to gleam something from this book that will impact your life in a positive way.
Ideally - you could read this book before you embark upon the "dating chapter" of your life.
But, even if you're not new to dating, this book can make an amazing and positive impact in many ways - it can increase your chances of finding the right person, reduce your chances of being hurt by or hurting someone (emotionally) during the dating process, and help you avoid scaring away someone with whom, otherwise, you could end up having a wonderful relationship.
I especially recommend this to women who are in a relationship (or, who are thinking that they "thought they were") with a man who seems to have changed all of a sudden.
If you are questioning things like, where did he go?
why didn't he call?
why does he seem so distant now?
what did I do wrong?
- you are possibly at a point in the relationship where your choice of actions can make or break a relationship that might just be on the edge of going somewhere.
And, likewise, I recommend this to men who feel that they've come to a point in their relationship where they all of a sudden "aren't sure" anymore, are feeling anxious or maybe even "trapped", and at the same time there is a strong need to just get away and think and/or if the woman you are dating seems to have become more insecure, worries more, questions you more, starts pressuring you more about commitment, etc.
All of these situations, emotions, etc.
are explained in this book.
You're not the only one - it's a normal part of dating - but, unfortunately, most of us won't possibly be able to understand this without someone else pointing it out to us - like Gray has done in this book.
Even if you are married - this book opens your eyes to many things and can really improve your level of understanding with your wife/husband.
If you are the perfect mate in a perfect relationship - you may not realize some of the problems other people experience and therefore, could probably benefit from this book by being able to better identify with friends, family, children when they come to you for advice
I found this book to be a vaguely interesting dissertation on what the SHAM (Self-Help Actualization Motivational) Movement is, and maybe even on why it is, but no help whatsoever in giving me any tools for argument against it.
I thought, sucked in by the interesting cover suggesting brain-washing in such a humorous way, that the author might have a sense of humor herself and I'd find her book absorbing intellectually and on other levels as well.
I would read a page or a paragraph or two, close the book, and nod off.
This is such a fascinating area, it could be the basis for a really fascinating book, but "Self-Help, Inc..." left me feeling I needed to go to a self-help group to deal with the density of the verbage.
It would not appeal most to the people most in need of reading it - the victims of SHAM
I have always been intrigued with the Hells Angels and this book answered many questions especially the history of the club.
I was impressed that the author lived with them for a year.
This is one of the few books so bad that I couldn't finish it.
There is no explanation of how things work,or in many cases what they really are.
I feel like the only motivation for any of the characters was greed, sex, or guilt about greed and sex.
Do not bother with this book
The original Julie and Romeo was delightful.
This book was utter nonsense.
A great disapointment.
Finished reading it only to find out if it might get better as you went along.
It Didn't
Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied.
For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second.
Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop.
Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters.
It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats.
Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.
I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated.
Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing.
But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one.
Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.
I was disapointed when I downloaded it and got 8 pages.
As a customer, I expected to have the digital version of the full book and not a summary.
I thought that the price difference was due to the absence of paper, printing, handling, shipping, etc.
The hardcover version is more than 300 pages; if you take the price per page of the digital version, the hardcover version should cost then ten times more!!!
All the examples are referred to that version and nowhere I was said that I was paying 5 dollars for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT.
I honestly believed that I was buying the full book.
I will think better before ebuying again...
I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim.
The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important.
However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel.
Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel.
I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book.
I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history.
It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now.

I looked at the 2002 printing as well as this 2006 revised printing in order to see what has been updated and all the reviews are identical.
why?
which edition are people reviewing?
I think Amazon is making a mistake by not alloting reviews properly.
I don't plan to buy this book until I can see the 2006 version and see if it's worth it myself
Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio.
The paperback proved to be easier for me.
Some may disagree, and in fact, many have asked me why I disliked this one so much; so, here is why: - scratch 'plotting'... by this point in the story, 'plodding' is more accurate.
- caracatures over characters.
A staple of the series, 2d characters; but by this point, when new characters keep getting introduced this late in the story, it becomes an annoyance, a drag and overkill.
- virtually zero gain.
the entire first half of the book is a rescue mission for a minor character and the mission, once accomplished (or not) is forgotten by the end of the book.
The third fourth of the book finally starts to swing thigns back to the original LB premise of end times doom and gloom thanks to the horrific judgments; sadly, it's very boring and slow.
However... -... the book doesn't get good until the last fourth.
And that, my friends, is not good for the overall quality of this entry in the series.
By this point, it's obvious that the authors were REALLY stretching it.
However, as I said, things got really good in the last few chapters and led into 'Armageddon', one of the best books in the series.
How ironic.
Thumbs way down for Left Behind: The Remnant.
It's sad when the best part of the book is a scene involving the antichrist sunbathing on a rooftop.
Michael Haller's life revolves around criminal defense, his an attorney operating out the back of his Lincoln town car.
His appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy, people either called him Mick or Mickey.
Tall, dark and Intelligent with his good looks and Irish blood lines made him a catch.
In the court room he was very together with great timing, in his personal life it was a mess, at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter.
His father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney; another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to, his father wrote books and practised law that didn't have room for innocent clients, so far Mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just wouldn't recognize innocence if it came along.
Being an Independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll, he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who couldn't afford to pay his fees.
In total he kept four Lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour, what he was really looking for was a franchise player, a case to keep the cash rolling, point blank a meal ticket.
Louis Ross Roulet dealt in LA property he was a rich playboy, currently booked on charges of ag-assault, GBI, and attempted rape, and although his arrest charges looked bad these could always be dropped to something less by the time he made court.
Mickey couldn't believe his luck not only a rich client but looking at the evidence it was stacked in favour to get him off the hook.
This was all too easy, in fact with sharp tactics of negotiation and manipulation it was an open and shut case.
Just as he was on a roll Mickey's close friend is murdered he begins to have second thoughts about his case something just didn't sit right, in his search for innocence had he instead stumbled upon something more sinister or maybe something just plain evil.
This is the first time in a long time that I have picked up a book based on a court room drama; but this book is much more than just that.
Michael Connelly has done a wonderful job; his close collaboration with real life defense attorneys has paid off with their knowledge shining through; well written and easy to follow so you don't get lost in the jargon of law, especially for someone like me who is not familiar with the US law system.
I'm hoping very much that Mr. Connelly will be able to entwine the exciting lawyer Mickey Haller in other books going forward, Congratulations to Michael Connelly for a rollercoaster read.

I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.
But this story is just way too slow.
Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.
I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.
About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.
I just couldn't get into the characters.
I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.
The very title for the book - "I Con" - despite its cleverness, should reveal the lack of any objectivity, or class for that matter, from the authors, Jeffrey S. Young pppppppppp William L. Simon.
I could best describe this book as a shoddy pastiche of ambiguous-sounding facts, poor research, colored by a palpable disdain for [arguably the most interesting legend of our time] Steve Jobs.
What is really distasteful is that this antipathy of the authors towards Steve Jobs, seems 'personal'; which, in a democratic sense, may be alright i guess, [but only] UNTIL facts begin to wear thin, and the research seems doctored, leaving the rants sounding hollow, unsavory and shrill.
And the facts aren't well-strung together either!
From the very opening description in the book, which overdramatizes and harps on about the return of a "reformed" Steve Jobs, to Apple in 1997 (as though the most unfathomably impossible phenomenon in the history of humankind had occurred), to the careful selection of maliciously undertoned quotations, and quite often blatant slanders about Jobs, the book appears to be a collation of 'hate diaries' maintained by two wannabe authors, whose sole purpose in writing this book seems to be to fuel an anti-Steve sentiment among its readers!
If you happen to be one of those people, who finds some twisted pleasure in those idle conversations that involve scandalmongering [especially Steve Jobs], then this book should provide ample fuel for your negative energy
This book is not as good as i thought it would be.
I hope i have better readings with Bryan Tracy's Advance selling
I consider myself an optimist and insightful person, but somehow managed to miss many of Postrel's insights.
She gives me even more hope that the future is going to be more wonderful than I previously thought.
She does keep that hope in check, though, by talking about the enemies of the future- primarily protectionists and those that see free trade as a threat, instead of the blessing that it is.
She thoroughly destroys the notion that 'there is nothing new under that sun'.
While the universe, therefore our earth, is necessarily finite, we misunderstand this finiteness because we misunderstand the different combinations things can be arranged in.
For example, a deck of cards has only 52 cards, but the number of combinations you can put the cards into is 52x51x50x49x...x3x2x1, which is a number larger than the number of particles in the universe!
So whenever you shuffle a deck of cards, you can rest assured, that that is probably the one and only time that arrangement of cards will ever be in existence... ever.
People are so inventive and creative and always looking for new things.
Obviously, there will always be new things.
Every time someone declares that we are nearing the end of history, science, technology, etc.
it's safe to say they have no idea what they are talking about.
We need to let people be as creative and as inventive as they can.
It will only make our lives better, on the whole.
There will always be setbacks, but as long as people can think, we will always find a way to make out of those setbacks.
The book is a stunning, intelligent look at modern life.
I liked it so much, I bought The Substance of Style, which is, yet, another insightful look at modern life.
The title grabbed me because I have been noticing for, oh about 14 years now, the decline of the truth in this country.
Unfortunately, this book is written precisely by the kind of person who has lost touch with reality and what truth is (definition of irony I believe).
The reason it is #1 on the bestseller list is because there is a ready audience out there, of similarly detached people, who want anything (and I mean anything - a website with a good conspiracy story and a glass of warm milk before bed everynight is their ideal) that backs up their point of view.
It is precisely why the truth is so out of fashion.
New media streams like the internet, blogs, etc.
offer up "news" without accountability.
They allow this segment of society to avoid confronting the truth and instead construct their own alternative realities.
It makes people like Frank Rich, rich, with very little effort.
Why bother checking facts, his core readership doesn't care whether it is true or not, just tell them Bush is evil
This book is seriously out of date for modern web design and development
I thought Keegan was a "serious" historian.
This book contains little to do with the actual war itself - you would have picked up more on how it was fought on a 2nd rate cable news channel - indeed I beleive thats where he did all his research for this poor excuse for a "serious" miltary analysis of the iraq war
I would first like to start by saying that The Picture of Dorian Gray is, by far, one on my favorite novels.
And were I not slightly dissapointed with this particular edition of the novel I would have given it 5 stars, without a doubt.
It is a fabulous story, I would recommend it to anyone.
[As a small sidenote -- I would simply like to say that Wilde's particular style of writing is one which I do, in general, find rather enjoyable.
]I have heard some people say that they found this book diffucult to muddle through.
I was not one of these people.
Also, The other stories in this book are not bad at all.
I enjoyed The Happy Prince quite thoroughly.
- *note this particular "fairy tale" was very reminiscent of Hans Christian Anderson's writings.
THE FLAW(S)!
I blame the editor for this one -- this book, as far as I have been able to find, does not include the alternate(slightly more drawn-out) ending to this novel.
I was, needless to say, a little upset by this missing detail.
(If I have merely overlooked this extended ending, by all means let me know) ANOTHER SMALL FLAW - If you have not read the book DO NOT, i repeat DO NOT, begin by reading the AUTHORS NOTE.
Although the authors note was very insightful and generally enjoyable to read - it easily gives away more than half the plot.
The authors note is a spoiler -- BEWARE.
Overall , still a great novel.
Not so happy with the editor
This is an easy to use instructional manual with practical assignments to help you retain the information given.
Highly recommended
My father was a chef, and although we did not have much money, I was brought up appreciating good, fresh, healthy food as well as cookbooks -- my father had a library of cookbooks, gastronomic dictionaries, even cookbooks in French (he was trained by a french chef in the 1950's).
With that being said, I am obsessed with eating, and occasionally cooking, good food.
This cookbook is the one I use over and over again.
I have cooked almost every recipe in the book, more than once, which is a true testament to a wonderful cookbook.
The beauty of it is that is is simple -- most ingredients are things you would have on-hand.
Most recipes are for the novice cook, but can be challenging enough for a true obsessed gourmet.
The other aspect is that he balances flavors and spices perfectly -- nothing is too overly spiced, heavy, etc.
When I cook for guests, I use this cookbook because it is manageable but makes me look like a genius.
People always say to me, "This tastes better than restaurant food!"
Get the hardback version -- it will last longer and make you feel like a true cook (as we all can be.
What a complete and utter waste of time.
Its obvious how these guys got dubbed the nutroots
An excellent, well explained art book, with beautiful and easy to follow illustrations.
The book is a treasure chest of ideas suitable for the primary classroom.
This book provides plenty of opportunities to explore the various strands of the visual arts field.
A great resource for any teacher, parent or doting aunt
Fans of the ABC-TV show "LOST" will probably be buying "Our Mutual Friend" in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the "last book [I] ever [read]".
Since I did not have to buy it, having purchased a full set of Dickens years ago, I immediately set out to read it.
What a disappointment it was!
Dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period.
One cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is, just a bit, perhaps, 'padded'.
Any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages.
Dickens' work is melodrama, but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art.
As Oscar Wilde said of 'The Old Curiosity Shop', "I simply cannot read of the death of Little Nell without laughing."
'OMF' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence.
Even worse is the ending.
Some endings just can't help but feel contrived; and Dickens, having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions, pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated.
All of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for "The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens" but I assure you that my only concern is for you, gentle reader.
Unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of Dickens' oeuvre or are required to read "Our Mutual Friend", I would, instead, direct you to Dickens' far superior works: 'David Copperfield', 'Oliver Twist', 'Pickwick Papers'.
If you are looking for 'LOST' reading material, I would refer you to 'Watership Down' (Excellent), 'The Stand' (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature), 'The Dark Tower' series (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature, and similar to 'Our Mutual Friend' possessed of a fatally flawed ending) or a review of philosophy like 'Locke, Rousseau and Hume'.
Namaste and Good Luck, AKA Redemption Isle on TheFuselage.co
In the last few decades historians --following sociologists such as Durkheim-- have turned their attention to the ways in which new technologies have altered people's experience of space and time.
Schivelbusch's small piece is a pretty good (but light-weight) example of this genre.
He reveals some interesting trivia along the way: he tells, for example, how padded upolstery was invented to assuage the fears of first-class passengers brought about by the roughness of new speed; he shows that compartment design in passenger cars reflect the contrasting social values of Europe and America.
But he is at his most interesting when describing the ways in which the railroad created new conceptual forms of geographical distance by obliterating the spaces in between destinations.
Furthermore, by creating the need for standardized time-tables, railways nurtured a standardized/homogenized conception of time.
Local idiocyncracies became less important.
Doubtless true national identities could never have emerged without revolutions in transportation and communications.
A book that takes these ideas much further is Stephen Kern's excellent work pppppppppp quot;The Culture of Time and Space.
pppppppppp quot; If this genre interests you, Kern's book is an important read
This audio-book was fantastic.
It took off like a horse out of the starting gate at the Kentucky Derby and never let up.
Vincente Callabrese is a part time enforcer/collector for the mob and part time movie producer student.
When Vincente is asked to produce one of his classmates screen plays this is a start of a new career for Vincente.
First a name change, from Vincente Callabrese to Michael Vincent.
Then it's off to Hollywood where he rapidly becomes one of the hottest producers in the movie business.
Unfortunately, Michael has a hard time shaking his past.
When he tries to buy the movie rights to a novel and is refused, he asks his old friend Tommy Povenzano for help.
Tommy assures Michael the he will help.
This is the start of all of Michael's problems.
In typical Woods fashion this novel is a mover.
Though this novel isn't full of excitement, it will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to see what happens next.
It doesn't take long between incidents.
The bottom line here is that this is a book not to be missed.
Choke Dead In the Water Orchid Beach These are all other options by Mr. Stuart and I would recommend any of them.
Though this book has not won any awards Mr. Woods won the Edgar Alan Poe award in 1982 and was nominated again in 1992.
Once you have read or listened to this book you will understand why.
pppppppppp quot;Disarming Iraq pppppppppp quot; is Hans Blix's thought-provoking and historically-important memoir of the few but critical months leading up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, during which he tried to paint a clear picture -- for the UN and the world -- of his inspection team's findings, claiming no need for urgency and lobbying for diplomacy.
The polarized atmosphere was palpably tense: while the U.S., the UK and Spain insisted that Iraq was not responding to inspections, France, Germany and Russia asserted with equal force that the inspection program had never been fully explored.
Parting the raging waters (for a few weeks, anyway) was the quintessential diplomat Hans Blix.
As it reads, he was too diplomatic, unwilling to state his results confidently for fear that it might drive UN policy.
It didn?t help that he had a few doubts of his own; that in spite of not finding any pppppppppp quot;smoking guns pppppppppp quot; in terms of banned weapons, he still sensed that Iraq was playing a cat-and-mouse game.
Either the regime's odd narcissism allowed it to believe that it did not have to comply with the UN, or it was hiding something.
Either way, Blix's hesitation was enough to set the stage for Colin Powell's historic February 5, 2003 presentation of evidence of WMD?s in Iraq, which was more or less the proverbial point of no return.
Apparently, what Mr. Blix was trying to tell us -- before he was drowned out by the noisy din of a fearful and overzealous media -- is now common knowledge about WMD?s in Iraq: Blix's commission failed to find anything not because the Iraqis succeeded at hiding the weapons, moving them ahead of inspections, but because the weapons really weren?t there.
Iraq had disarmed at the end of the Gulf War in 1991, just as they?d claimed.
The UN inspection program had worked -- without knowing it.
So how did the war move forward under false pretenses?
According to Blix, pppppppppp quot;a deficit of critical thinking pppppppppp quot; was to blame.
He speculates that our Congress would never affirm the use of force merely to end a reign of terror (even though Blix himself wishes for a UN resolution against brutal dictatorships).
The Bush administration had to justify war in Iraq by linking it to terror, and since there was no real link, it had to capitalize on the pppppppppp quot;theoretical pppppppppp quot; link of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
This is as far as his speculation goes.
Where the phrase pppppppppp quot;military industrial complex pppppppppp quot; would seem most natural and expected -- followed by a salacious tell-all about Bush, Cheney and nefarious links to Saudi oil -- Blix cleverly sidesteps the issue of America's impatient itch for war by feigning ignorance.
Giving Blix the benefit of the doubt, perhaps he prefers to be thought of as naive and not sensational.
Needless to say, Dr. David Kelly's death (the British scientist who leaked to the BBC that the British government had pppppppppp quot;sexed up pppppppppp quot; a document alleging Iraq's nuclear capabilities) was an pppppppppp quot;unfortunate suicide pppppppppp quot; -- and not the work of a shadow government.
(The entire document, by the way, turned out to be a forgery.)
At least Blix observed the pppppppppp quot;horse trading pppppppppp quot; ( pppppppppp quot;intense economic and diplomatic pressures pppppppppp quot;) our government used to obtain votes from other countries -- votes needed to pass the UN resolution authorizing the use of force -- as well as he disapproved the Bush administration?s spying on UN delegations while on their diplomatic visits to New York.
Blix had other objections to U.S.-led efforts, but they are all based on facts and evidence, and are in defense of IAEA (a previous inspection organization, also headed by Blix) and UNMOVIC (the UN's Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission).
Interestingly, the largest setback to diplomacy was related to a 167-page pppppppppp quot;cluster pppppppppp quot; document released by Blix in early March of 2003, which summarized all the inspections for the three preceding months.
Unfortunately for France and Germany, American and British members of UNMOVIC leaked pre-release draft copies of the document.
In other words, France and Germany had much less time to prepare their official reactions to the cluster document than their British and American counterparts.
Their positions, in favor of renewed inspections, were not as compelling.
While Blix?s passion is definitely enough to carry his memoirs, one can easily see why it was so difficult for Americans to take Mr. Blix seriously: he lacks that forcible personality that commands respect.
Even so, he is gifted with an even temperament, a good sense of humor, and a deeply-imbued sense of integrity, all important qualities for diplomacy.
Although he may have been the only individual capable of peaceably bridging the large gap between the UN and Iraq, in retrospect it may have been asking too much from some of our leaders to match Blix?s diplomatic efforts in their reasonableness and patience
This is not a book about management.
It is a wonderful exploration about how and why groups of individuals can and do make better decisions than individuals.
It sets out some necessary conditions for this wisdom to be able to take place and then does some excellent analysis of why that happens.
What I got out of this book was some very important ideas about why collaborative decision making is important and how to assure that it is done well (If you want the other side Irving Janis' old classic on Groupthink is a good counterpoint.)
Unlike a lot of other big idea books this one is very literate and readable.
It is a joy to read but it also offers some very substantive ideas
Dorothy Parker was a great writer and a great social observant who now gives us a clear window into the past.
Her wit is biting and at it's best in this collection, favourite reads are for the individual to decide, however, for me, as well as cheering me up with her razor sharp observation and almost cruel wit.
Parker also saddens me for her wit must have been based on the cynacism of one who viewed her life as overindulged and wasted by circumstance, as a wealthy woman and as a woman in her time.
Reading her is alawys like laughing with a red hot tear in your eye, for her work is as much an insight into her soul as it is to her lifetime and lifestyle
This rare book details Aleister Crowley's ascension as the prophet of a new Aeon, the Aeon of Horus.
Out of all the Aleister Crowley books in mass market format, this stood out in memory years after I read it as one of Crowley's most disturbing works.
In fact, I questioned my new faith in Crowley's religion Thelema reading this book; this was for real and not a joke.
After contemplating, I thought it would be worth it stick with this because witchcraft is now a cool thing amongst today's youth and Crowley was a famous early form of witchcraft as we know it today.
This is serious stuff, I wouldn't mess around with this unless you are interested in the occult.
It should be noted that real life ritual magick as described in these type of works really do work; I did a ritual from Necronomicon and Lesser Key of Solomon to help with a college Astronomy course- I got a respectable C grade when I close to failing with a D-.
But be prepared for some harassment aboyt alleged satanism.
It has the potential to be a great book if the author had taken some time to actually look into each breed.
The "Canadian Eskimo Dog" is now referred to as the Canadian Inuit Dog out of respect for the Inuit people.
He has the dog's height wrong, and the weight range is much too high.
This leads me to conclude that if there were that many errors on one dog breed, who's to say that it's not wrong on other breeds too?
I was quite disgusted and mad to see the "designer dogs" put as purebred dogs.
Labradoodles, Bichon/Yorkies, Cockerpoos, and Bull Boxers are NOT purebred dogs.
They are mixes given a fancy name and sold for staggering amounts of money.
The first few chapters on the history of the dog is quite fascinating though, and the pictures are nice.
If you need an all-in-one book and don't mind many errors, this is a great book for you.
If you're like me, go down the road of buying a better dog encyclopedia and different books on different subjects rather than this faulty all-in-one
