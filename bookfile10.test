Teresa A. Callen "www.imgarts.com"		It's Not about Food: Change Your Mind; Change Your Life; End Your Obsession with Food and Weight: Books: Carol Emery Normandi,Laurelee Roark		2		This book was a gift given to me by a friend years ago. <sssss> I own and have read about twelve books on the topic. <sssss> Out of all of them, this has been by far the best. <sssss> By the end it feels like a journey inside yourself has taken place and you arrive to a new destination on your insides. <sssss> The feel of the book is one of love and support. <sssss> Not the self-centered type, or author as guru type that I have read in other books--this one has the experience of two professional therapists that shows itself in each chapter. <sssss> It made a large difference in my struggle with an eating disorder that started at age 10. <sssss> I am now 44.
Donna Delaune "donnaread"		The Twelfth Card (A Lincoln Rhyme Novel): Books: Jeffery Deaver,Dennis Boutsikaris		1		I'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with. <sssss> However, my public library has a limited selection of audio books, so I take what I can get. <sssss> I am a voracious reader, and I listen to audios to get more "reading" in, as you can listen and do other things. <sssss> I much prefer the Lillian Jackson Braun "cat" books, at least there is some humor, and I like the "mystery" part of these books better than Deaver's. <sssss> Sorry to all the Deaver fan's out there...I HAVE enjoyed a few of his books, but I get tired of the "same ole-same ole"
christen		Eat Yourself Slim: Adapted for North America: Books: Michel Montignac		2		This plan actually works! <sssss> In five months I've gone from a women's 2X to a 12 and I'm not finished yet! <sssss> The basic plan is simple. <sssss> Managing the exceptions is a bit more tricky, but of the three books I have by Michel Montignac, this one explains the exceptions the best. <sssss> No counting calories! <sssss> No extreme excercise! <sssss> If you are looking for a balanced way of eating -- THIS IS IT
Michael Sallmen "msallmen"		Every Landlord's Legal Guide, Eighth Edition: Books: Marcia Stewart,Janet Portman,Ralph E. Warner		2		If you are planning to become a landlord, buy this essential book before you purchase a rental property or hang that "For Rent" sign in front of your house. <sssss> A healthy dose of legal reality will counterbalance any easy money ideas you may have and help you decide whether the work and risk involved in being a landlord is how you would like to make money. <sssss> The legal concepts you learn may even influence which properties you buy and how you maintain them. <sssss> If you are already a landlord, keep this book at your finger tips. <sssss> The information is well organized and easy to find for quick reference. <sssss> Legal concepts are presented in plain language and illustrated with scenarios showing how the concepts might play out in real life. <sssss> The authors make dry legal topics as interesting as possible. <sssss> Add the urgency of knowing a legal misstep could land you on the wrong side of a lawsuit, and you will find yourself eagerly turning these pages
Gabriel E. Borlean		The practice of the presence of God (The Spiritual masters series): Books: Lawrence		2		As a "follower of Christ" (Christian) who considers himself an Evangelical Protestant, this little devotional book will hold a special place in my library and my heart. <sssss> For all Christian believers, the richness and power of Brother Lawrence's life's witness and words are a fountain of Truth, a treasure that is as elegant (spiritually) as it is simple. <sssss> For the non-believers, I am afraid that reading this booklet (a spiritual treasure in disguise) will just confirm St. Paul the Apostles's words that "the message of the cross is ... foolishness to the Gentiles" (1 Corinthians. <sssss> 1:18, 23 and 2:14). <sssss> The only way to do justice to this booklet is to quote from it and let you get a taste of it ... <sssss> This is a unique biography because it is not compiled by the Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection (birth name Nicholas Herman but known by his monastic name) but by the ones around his life in 17th century France. <sssss> Thus one learns very little about the beginnings of his life but very much about his godly lifestyle in the last 30 years of life of bliss (presence of God in his heart) and suffering (3 physical and debilitating ailments). <sssss> We learn about this Spirit-filled vessel in God's vineyard - Brother Lawrence, by reading the Eulogy of the abbot of Lawrence's Christian community, 4 short notes of his conversations with his spiritual father - Abb? <sssss> de Beaufort, 16 very short letters of spiritual advice and encouragement Brother Lawrence wrote to friends and seekers, a manuscript found at his death called "Spiritual Maxims" and a memoir of a leader in the church in France. <sssss> The followings are a selection of the many highlights and underlined phrases and sentences from this book: "Busy yourself with keeping your mind in the presence of the Lord." <sssss> "My most normal habit is to simply keep my attention on God, and to be generally and lovingly aware of Him." <sssss> "I occupy myself solely with keeping my attention on God and by being generally and lovingly aware of Him." <sssss> "We have an infinitely good God who knows what we need." <sssss> "Console yourself with the One who keeps you fastened to the cross." <sssss> "We should love our friends, but without prejudicing the love of God which must be first." <sssss> "Think often about Him; worship Him without ceasing. <sssss> Life and die with Him. <sssss> This is the beautiful call in the life of a Christian." <sssss> "...we should love one another through our words of counsel and even more through our good examples." <sssss> "...our only business in this life is to please God. <sssss> ... my little progress in the path of perfection." <sssss> "I applied myself to practicing the presence of God ... <sssss> Doing this gave me such a high esteem for God that faith alone was capable of satisfying me." <sssss> "A devout woman told me that the spiritual life is a life of grace that begins with service fear, increases through the hope of eternal life, and is consumated by pure love." <sssss> MY PRAYER: May we all experience God's love, which truly can consume all other passions, and be filled with His grace which will empower us to truly love our neighbors (Christian and non-Christian) as ourselves. <sssss> This is my life goal
B. Anderson "bander book"		The Zinn Reader: Writings on Disobedience and Democracy: Books: Howard Zinn		1		I first read passages from this book in college. <sssss> I can now see how liberal professors very much enjoy using this book to influence young minds. <sssss> Professor Zinn is a far left author. <sssss> He uses the usual lines: America generally bad, communism generally good. <sssss> Obviously Mr. Zinn has the right to write whatever he wants, and his writing style is very convincing. <sssss> However, if the reader investigates the facts, many holes become visible in his theories. <sssss> Those who agree and disagree with his writings should explore opposite viewpoints. <sssss> A good example is "Intellectual Morons : How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas by Daniel J. Flynn" which gives the reader a good profile of Mr. Zinn.
Mindy Anderson		Pride and Prejudice (Modern Library): Books: Jane Austen,Anna Quindlen		2		I really enjoyed this book. <sssss> It took me a while to read it, about 2 months, because it's definitely not fast paced. <sssss> I was glad I had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand. <sssss> Mr. Darcy is "pride" and Elizabeth Bennett is "prejudice". <sssss> These two are made for each other, unbeknown to themselves. <sssss> This is essentially the story of how they fall in love, with lots of twists and turns. <sssss> I really like Mr. Darcy. <sssss> He is the perfect gentleman. <sssss> He is readily willing to admit his own faults, when they are brought to his knowledge. <sssss> He also doesn't retaliate when rejected by Elizabeth and accused of things he didn't do or that are misunderstood. <sssss> Elizabeth is also wonderful. <sssss> She is doubtful about people and quite cynical. <sssss> I really like that about her. <sssss> It makes for some great banter between Darcy and herself. <sssss> My favorite part of the book is when Elizabeth see Darcy at Pemberly. <sssss> This is where I think she begins to fall in love with him. <sssss> Pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself. <sssss> I would probably be charmed by him too! <sssss> This book took a little commitment to get through, but once I got into it, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, even though I already knew the story. <sssss> I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Regency England
mistermaxxx@yahoo.com "mistermaxxx"		Space Between the Stars: My Journey to an Open Heart: Books: Deborah Santana		2		sometimes when you read a book you are expecting to read some details,but a book like this blows the lid off the mother fully. <sssss> Deborah Santana doesn't hold back at all. <sssss> she takes you on a journey from her childhood to her teen years with Sly Stone. <sssss> pppppppppp then eventually with her Husband Carlos Santana. <sssss> you read about a strong Woman who overcame so many obstacles pppppppppp was grounded strongly pppppppppp thrived despite some negative forces. <sssss> a very powerful book that you simply can't put down. <sssss> Deborah Santana is a Remarkable Soul Sister. <sssss> this is a Must read book from start to finish.
Joe		The Kite Runner: Books: Khaled Hosseini		1		The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together. <sssss> The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental. <sssss> By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation. <sssss> I wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up, stay focused, and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand
Brian Winters		Improving Data Warehouse and Business Information Quality: Methods for Reducing Costs and Increasing Profits: Books: Larry P. English		2		I have been an information systems professional for several years now and I am happy to see that there is finally a focus on data as the asset it truly is. <sssss> If I could put pppppppppp quot;certified data pppppppppp quot; on the Balance sheet as a separate line item, I would. <sssss> I have been reading your book pppppppppp quot;Improving Data Warehouse and Business Information Quality pppppppppp quot; over the past several weeks and I have this ear-to-ear grin that some peers find disturbing. <sssss> (Why does he get so excited about data?) <sssss> High Quality Data=success
Dr.Tanne		The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time: A Novel: Books: Mark Haddon		2		Different, refreshing, entertaining, funny, eye opening....even better than reading the book is to listen to it (buy the Audio CD!) <sssss> on a loooooong drive..
BioReader		Circus Fire, The: Books: Stewart O'Nan,Dick Hill		1		Mr. O'Nan should have taken a refresher course in basic writing. <sssss> His skipping and skimming and throwing to and fro people, events, etc., is downright frustrating and confuses the project. <sssss> Unlike superior literary treatments (see Walter Lord's TITANIC), this book leave you with more questions than anything else and the urge to take a long, hot shower.
1tiredmommy "1tiredmommy"		Protecting the Gift: Keeping Children and Teenagers Safe (and Parents Sane): Books: Gavin De Becker		2		This book should be a mandatory read for every parent pppppppppp parent to be. <sssss> What an eye opener!!! <sssss> This book gives you things to look for in predators...how they operate. <sssss> There are comments from real predators as well as victims. <sssss> The book can be difficult to read at times. <sssss> People are truly sick! <sssss> But it gives parents power in what to look for pppppppppp how talk to your child(ren). <sssss> MUST READ!
C.B.Liddell		Samurai: Books: Shusaku Endo		1		This novel of a 17th century samurai's odyssey to Europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way, but towards the end, Endo does get in a few good points. <sssss> The style is somewhat pedantic and staid, but easy to read. <sssss> It's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces. <sssss> The historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut-and-pastes from history textbooks. <sssss> I must admit I am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here. <sssss> I can only conclude that a lot of people who don't really have much experience of Japan, think they've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly Westernized piece of writing by a Japanesese Christian. <sssss> Remember, not every Japanese woman is a geisha, and not every Japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai's sword
"blake2001"		The Copyeditor's Handbook: A Guide for Book Publishing and Corporate Communications: Books: Amy Einsohn		1		A rather toothless attempt at rewriting Strunk and White, or Chicago into pppppppppp quot;fun. <sssss> pppppppppp quot; Reference books shouldn't waste this much space on casual conversation. <sssss> Get to the point--get Elements of Style, Elements of Grammar, and Chicago rather than this handbook
Susie Morris "Book Junkie"		True Betrayals (Thorndike Large Print Basic Series): Books: Nora Roberts		2		I think Nora Roberts has a fantasy with horses and horse farms, as we've seen in her books Irish Thoroughbred, Irish Rebel and now True Betrayals which was written in 1996. <sssss> Unlike the other two, True Betrayals is not pure romantic fiction but a blend of several genres. <sssss> To me, it was very interesting and kept me amused and entertained for several hours. <sssss> Kelsey Byden was led to believe that her mother, Naomi Chadwick, had been dead for quite a few years and when she received a letter from her mother asking if she'd come visit her, she was an emotional wreck. <sssss> It seems the real reason her mother wasn't a part of her life as she grew up was the fact that she had been in prison for killing her lover. <sssss> Talk about shock value! <sssss> Kelsey decides to visit her mother to try to come to terms with her emotions - Kelsey had recently divorced and just finding out her dead mother was very much alive was enough to make anyone emotionally unstable and made Kelsey question everything in her life. <sssss> Naomi has a working horse farm in Virginia and Kelsey goes to try to make sense out of her life. <sssss> Sounds like a typical plot line, right? <sssss> Well, sort of, but if Nora Roberts is writing it, you can bet there are a few twists and turns along the way. <sssss> Like Kelsey being thrown into a situation that could result in another murder. <sssss> Can the trainer who works for her mother be the answer to Kelsey's broken heart? <sssss> Can Kelsey ever trust her mother again after being deceived by her for so many years? <sssss> Will Kelsey ever believe in herself again? <sssss> I won't give away any of the plot, you'll have to read and enjoy this one for yourself! <sssss> I do have to say that the plot is not the part of the book that I enjoyed the most - sure there's a little mystery thrown in just to keep things interesting. <sssss> Sure there is lots of romance and sorting of feelings toward the mother-daughter relationship. <sssss> But what I enjoyed the most were the descriptions of the horse ranch, the surrounding areas, actual workings of the ranch, etc. <sssss> Nora Roberts is first rate at painting a very vivid mental image and I found myself slipping off to Virginia and owning a ranch of my own in my imagination while reading this book. <sssss> The lush green landscape, the openness of the working ranch, the racetrack - ah, it sounded like pure heaven. <sssss> The plot is very predictable: everyone lives happily-ever-after, mother and daughter are reunited, true love waits for Kelsey, etc., etc. <sssss> What makes the story enjoyable is the mix that Roberts has perfected - not just pure romance, but a little mystery and intrigue also.
Simon Brunner		Advanced PHP Programming: Books: George Schlossnagle		2		Read on if you are: - Used to PHP programming, but not a very sophisticated programmer. <sssss> - Looking out to do more programming on a higher level. <sssss> - Ready to read through book texts three times and to read further material that is not included in the book you buy. <sssss> Schlossnagle's book is not written along one red line, it covers various topics and allows jumping around quite freely. <sssss> However, the topics that it covers are highly efficient in helping you advance with your programming skills. <sssss> They might not quite be what you'd expect from a PHP book, because actually Schlossnagle covers anything that is needed to work with PHP on a professional level. <sssss> Consider this list of topics: - Write clean code - OO-Design Patterns - Project documentation - Performance tunings This is all not really PHP-only stuff, but it is a great source of inspiration and furthers the understanding of programming in general very much. <sssss> The latter I find is necessary for everybody who's up to something bigger in PHP. <sssss> The PHP examples in the book are - I have to admit - maybe sometimes rather scarce. <sssss> One would like to see more applications of abstract problems, more examples. <sssss> But is that what a book is for, to give examples? <sssss> I don't think so. <sssss> For me a book is mainly a source of great ideas from great programmers, anything else is available on the web. <sssss> After having bought "Advanced PHP Programming" I purchased other books, the topics of which I would not have considered without reading Schlossnagle's work. <sssss> I'm just about to write a diploma work and the book is a great reference for anything concerning PHP and development projects
Michael Erisman		When No One Sees: The Importance of Character in an Age of Image: Books: Os Guinness,Virginia Mooney		2		Os Guinness has a knack for taking difficult and complex subjects and capturing and presenting information that allows small chunks of the philosophy to be grasped and pondered deeply. <sssss> This book is no exception. <sssss> The fact that it is also a study guide is even more effective in delivering the message while directing the reader to several key questions to consider in each section. <sssss> One of the best aspects of the book are the hundreds of quotes and essays, all around the central theme of the importance of character. <sssss> While our culture often acts to create an "end justifies the means" behavioral set, never before has character been so important, or so difficult to really practice and live. <sssss> The book begins with some essays from famous leaders; from Plato to George Washington, Winston Churchill to Machiavelli, and compares and contrasts what each felt about the importance of character, and how it was to be demonstrated. <sssss> Much of the material is pretty well known, yet the ability to so easily read and discuss different styles and approaches is well worth the effort. <sssss> My favorite sections were on the "Cultural Erosions of Character" in which the many examples of how society pushes and changes the definition and meaning in life impacts what we define as important at all. <sssss> From advertising, to media, the pressure to conform is greater than ever, but in some ways has always existed. <sssss> One of the best essay's in my opinion is called the "Revenge of Failure" wherein Henry Fairlie rips the "legend of our times", as envy at its worst. <sssss> No longer content to envy what others have and we do not, we now attempt to destroy in others that which we cannot achieve ourselves. <sssss> This process degrades talent and is a poor attempt to "buy" our way into importance not through the achievement of something remarkable, but through the tearing down of the remarkable achievement into something attainable. <sssss> Thus character becomes something that is no longer "earned". <sssss> The sections on plastic surgery and other shifts into a looks based culture further erode the importance of character. <sssss> In this relentless and obsessed pursuit of the elusive perfection, the hunter becomes the hunted, and always loses in the battle to fight against aging and the myth of happiness in ones physical appearance. <sssss> Powerful depictions of how this societal pressure has claimed far too many who sacrifice character for fleeting and shallow appearance, are depicted with a convicting clarity. <sssss> Overall, this is a very well done and thought provoking book. <sssss> As a study guide it would be ideal for small groups, or even personal reflections. <sssss> The book is so full of quotes and essays that it can be read at once, or in dozens of small bites with equal effectiveness. <sssss> Highly recommended.
Alfred Johnson		Literature and Revolution: Books: Leon Trotsky		2		Trotsky once wrote that of the three great tragedies in life- hunger, sex and death- revolutionary Marxism, which was the driving force behind his life and work, mainly concerned itself with the struggle against hunger. <sssss> That observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the Marxist tradition. <sssss> However, as Trotsky demonstrates here, Marxist methodology cannot and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle. <sssss> Here Trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development. <sssss> In a healthy post-capitalist society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged. <sssss> If the task of socialism were merely to vastly expand economic equality, in a sense, it would be a relativity simple task for a healthy socialist society in concert with other like-minded societies to provide general economic equality with a little tweaking after vanquishing the capitalism mode of production. <sssss> What Marxism aimed for, and Trotsky defends here, is a prospect that with the end of class society and economic and social injustice the capacity of individual human beings to reach new heights of intellectual and creative development would flourish. <sssss> That is the thought that underpins Trotsky's work here as he analyzes various trends in Russian literature in the immediate aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. <sssss> In short, Marxism is certainly not a method to be followed in order to write great literature but it does allow one to set that literature in its social context and interrelatedness. <sssss> You will find no Deconstructionist or other fashionable literary criticism here. <sssss> Quite the contrary. <sssss> Here Trotsky uses his finely tuned skill as a Marxist to great effect as he analyzes the various trends of literature as they were affected (or not affected) by the October Revolution and sniffs out what in false in some of the literary trends. <sssss> Mainly at the time of writing the jury was still out about the prospects of many of these trends. <sssss> He analyzes many of the trends that became important later in the century in world literature, like futurism and constructivism, and others- some of which have disappeared and some of which still survive. <sssss> The most important and lasting polemic which Trotsky raised here, however, was the fight against the proponents of `proletarian culture'. <sssss> The argument put forth by this trend maintained that since the Soviet Union was a workers state those who wrote about working class themes or were workers themselves should in the interest of cultural development be given special status and encouragement (read a monopoly on the literary front). <sssss> Trotsky makes short shrift of this argument by noting that, in theory at least as its turned out, the proletarian state was only a transitional state and therefore no lasting `proletarian culture' would have time to develop. <sssss> Although history did not turn out to prove Trotsky correct the polemic is still relevant to any theory of mass cultural development. <sssss> One of the results of the publication of this book is that many intellectuals, particularly Western intellectuals, based some of their sympathy for Trotsky the man and fallen hero on his literary analysis and his ability to write. <sssss> This was particularly true during the 1930's here in America where those who were anti-Stalinist but were repelled by the vacuity of the Socialist Party were drawn to him. <sssss> A few, like James T. Farrell (Studs Lonigan trilogy), did this mostly honorably. <sssss> Most, like Dwight MacDonald and Sidney Hooks, etc. <sssss> did not and simply used that temporary sympathy as a way station on their way to anti-Communism. <sssss> Such is the nature of the political struggle. <sssss> A note for the politically- inclined who read this book. <sssss> Trotsky wrote this book in 1923-24 at the time of Lenin's death and later while the struggle for succession by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev was in full swing. <sssss> While Trotsky did not recognize it until later (nor did others, for that matter) this period represented the closing of the rising tide of the revolution. <sssss> Hereafter, the people who ruled the Soviet Union, the purposes for which they ruled and the manner in which they ruled changed dramatically. <sssss> In short, Thermidor in the classical French revolutionary expression was victorious. <sssss> Given his political position why the hell was he writing a book on literary trends in post-revolutionary society at that time.
Scipio		The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Part 2 (Classic Non-fiction): Books: Edward Gibbon		1		The Amazon description says Vol. <sssss> 1-3, boxed set, hardcover. <sssss> That is all true. <sssss> What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes. <sssss> The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)." <sssss> That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used. <sssss> If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you. <sssss> If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere
Nelson J. Teed		Heather Has Two Mommies: 10th Anniversary Edition (Alyson Wonderland): Books: Leslea Newman,Diane Souza		1		The book's appearance and story line are both lighthearted and gentle with the underlying message that acceptance is the highest of all virtues. <sssss> This approach will probably work for a typical 5 year old child in a Lesbian led household - especially a girl child. <sssss> If the child is a boy and/or approachng 8 or 9 years old, the hard questions start coming and this book pretends these questions will never be asked. <sssss> Doesn't everyone have a father, somewhere? <sssss> Who is my father? <sssss> What is he like? <sssss> Where is he? <sssss> Does he know about me? <sssss> Does he care about me? <sssss> Why don't I know? <sssss> Why don't you know, Mommy? <sssss> Mommy, when you grew up you lived with your Daddy, why don't I? <sssss> When I grow up, should I live with a man or a woman? <sssss> Why? <sssss> How/when will I know? <sssss> Does it matter? <sssss> Is our family really a complete family if my father is unknown? <sssss> I want to be a father some day. <sssss> How do I learn what good fathers do? <sssss> I love my friends and my dog;Does that make us a family? <sssss> Think about it.
C. Brooks "Book lover"		Lessons from the Apprentice: Secrets to Success from the Boardroom to the Business World: Books: Michael Robin,Authorized by The Apprentice,Donald Trump		1		I gave this book two stars because the book was a little boring and dragged on in some areas. <sssss> The best information was in the margins and the quotes not really any of the information in the book. <sssss> I have read: Carolyn, Bill, and Amy's books and I want to give this one a try. <sssss> This book is truly for The Apprentice TV lover but if you are looking for business advice this is not the book for you
Midwest Book Review		Mind's Eye: An Eye of the Beholder Collection: Books: Peter Kuper		2		Mind's Eye is the second 'Eye of the Beholder' collection, which began as the first comic strip to run in the New York Times, and provides a fine set of black and white strips which presents a particular viewpoint. <sssss> These visual puzzles provide much food for thought: there are panels of scenes, then turn the page for the unifying concept linking them
Mark Buchholtz		Disinformation: 22 Media Myths That Undermine the War on Terror: Books: Richard Miniter,James Miniter,James Jenner		1		Miniter takes advantage of the American ideological divide by cashing in with controversal editorials of hyperbole. <sssss> Maybe he could get together for a book with Ann Coulter
Karen Tanner		How to Say It: Choice Words, Phrases, Sentences, and Paragraphs for Every Situation, Revised Edition: Books: Rosalie Maggio		1		This is not what I expected or wanted. <sssss> The book is written for business senarios with very few suggestions of a personal nature. <sssss> The description of the book does not indicate that it is mainly for business use
A. C. Bonsor		Roar Restored: Detroit Tigers 06: Books: Detroit Free Press		1		While this book put together by the Detroit Free Press has action photos, they are some of the most disappointing pictures i've ever seen in a book about a team's season. <sssss> Where are the photos of Tiger players actually hitting a baseball? <sssss> If you want to see photos of players celebrating and covered in champagne, talking to fans and media and blowing bubbles, then this is the book for you but if you want to see some actual fine baseball action shots from the diamond itself, be prepared to be frustrated. <sssss> I much preferred the photograhy in the George Cantor paperback "Out of Nowhere" The Detroit Tigers' Magical 2006 Season. <sssss> I know that this volume covers the Play-offs and World Series whereas the Cantor book doesn't, but it's photo collection is poor, the photos in the Cantor book are superb. <sssss> If you are a Tiger fan you may enjoy this book very much, (the writing and articles are quite good at least)but my enjoyment was spoilt somewhat by hardly any pictures of Tiger players hitting baseballs or fielding grounders etc. <sssss> Very disappointing, worth only 2 stars
John Q Public		The Naked and the Dead: 50th Anniversary Edition: Books: Norman Mailer		1		It truly is the best war fiction regarding WWII if you have never read ANY other fiction regarding WWII. <sssss> I love war fiction and non-fiction and beside parroting the Time Magazine blurb prominently displayed in the novel I can not even come close to understanding why anyone, let alone review after review, would even come close to that stupefying conclusion. <sssss> To me it is the best example of intellectual snobbery that critics like to pat themselves on the back with. <sssss> Only they understand and you lesser intellects are not capable of appreciating. <sssss> What it is, is a bloated, narcisstic, misogynistic waste of time. <sssss> Of course any piece of literature is subjective, but to me, this critically acclaimed work fails on every level that a novel should, regardless of genre. <sssss> Unless you love James Joyce (another bad writer lorded over us by the critically elite), I think most readers expect some sort of plot development. <sssss> Don't expect that here. <sssss> How about engaging characters that develop and grow throughout the novel? <sssss> You better pick up something else. <sssss> It seems to me the reader should at least be invested in one of the character's outcome. <sssss> Far too pedestrian a thought if you "get" this art. <sssss> If I can't have any of that how about writing a character that is even remotely likable? <sssss> Forget it non-ivy leaguer! <sssss> I was rooting for the Japanese to kill them all, so at least their "loved" ones at home would be spared of these nearly universally despicable human beings. <sssss> The only thing that propelled me to finish was to get to the ending that would perhaps tie together the painful experience of reading these soldier's hateful ruminations while, oh by the way, a war was being fought around them. <sssss> Nope, no big ending either. <sssss> It just ends. <sssss> Yes, I have heard that the plodding ugliness and pointlessness of the entire book is to symbolize war itself. <sssss> Give me a break. <sssss> While this may be bad news for us common folk duped into reading it, it certainly is good news for Tom Clancy. <sssss> His last two decades of literature are just misunderstood genius depicting the banality of human existence and not bad writing at all.
Angel		Hispanics/Latinos in the United States : Ethnicity, Race, and Rights: Books: Jorge J. E. Gracia,Pablo De Greiff,Pablo De Greiff,Jorge J.E. Gracia		1		This book is an nice collection of differing points of views about latinos/hispanics. <sssss> However it's primarily philisophical. <sssss> It's more confusing than inspiring. <sssss> It's great for those studying for a phD, but will not inspire average latinos to action. <sssss> This book tilts slightly more towards the assimilationist point of view, although a few writers do express some pan-latino thoughts.
A reader		The 80/20 Principle: The Secret of Achieving More With Less: Books: Richard Koch		1		The 20% you need to know: This book is poorly written, and the author would do well to use the 80/20 principle in his writing. <sssss> The 80% that will make up the rest of the review: I have never read such boring prose. <sssss> I've had the concept fully explained to me. <sssss> I fully understand what the principle is. <sssss> I have heard it about 80 times now when 20 would have been enough (actually, once would have been enough). <sssss> Now, what do I do with it? <sssss> How do I implement it into my life? <sssss> I am now on page 53 and he still hasn't gotten around to that part. <sssss> It seems to me he should have used the theory when writing this book. <sssss> Cut to the chase! <sssss> Give me the top 20% of useful information so I can go ahead and use it to increase my productivity and effectiveness by 80%. <sssss> Instead I get the feeling I'm wandering around aimlessly in the bottom part of his bar charts among the 80% of fluff to fill up his book quota. <sssss> How many stories about economists and computer software do we really need? <sssss> I don't know about you, but I wanted to increase my productivity by using my time better, and reading this book so far has been a complete waste of it
Angela		The Thin You Within You: Winning the Weight Game with Self-Esteem: Books: Abraham Twerski		1		I found this book to be full of silly metaphors (as if that's the only way we could relate to Dr. Twerski). <sssss> It just didn't get me the information I needed. <sssss> Perhaps others would find it motivational
Jeremiah Lawson		Christian Modesty and the Public Undressing of America: Books: Jeff Pollard		1		by focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit Pollard's book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might. <sssss> And while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion, (i.e. <sssss> swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century) Pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of Christian virtue. <sssss> This is basically saying Christians have lost a culture war without explaining why. <sssss> While the initial exposition on what the parameters of Christian modesty mean Pollard provides no application for what a suitable example of Christian modesty would be. <sssss> Furthermore, when push comes to shove he refers to the Westminster Larger Catechism for application rather than sticking to the biblical principles he espoused. <sssss> Some of his cases are self-defeating. <sssss> On one hand he notes that garments in biblical periods could be sleeveless and then states that the inexorable decline of swimwear in the west into sluttiness really began when sleeveless swimwear appeared in the mid-19th century. <sssss> Props for giving the topic serious consideration but as an exegetical study it is still wanting. <sssss> On the other hand, it's cheap so if you're not persuaded the research has been effective it won't cost you much
Laurence Stybel "Boardoptions.com"		The Strategy of Conflict: Books: Thomas C. Schelling		2		The 2005 Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Robert Aumann and Thomas C. Schelling. <sssss> Schelling is professor of Economics at the University of Maryland and applied game theory to conflict. <sssss> His focus was on the weapons issues but his ideas have been applied to a host of business issues. <sssss> In this review, we will apply some of Shelling's concepts to how companies fire employees. <sssss> Schelling says "uncertain retaliation is more efficient than certain retaliation" when bargaining and "the capability to retaliate is more useful than the ability to defend." <sssss> Now let's get practical. <sssss> GOODBYE SCENARIO As a verb, "goodbye" is the act of parting. <sssss> It is also an acknowledgement of parting. <sssss> A goodbye scenario assumes that once employees physically leave the building, they will never be a factor for the company's future. <sssss> The relationship was transactional and the transaction is now over. <sssss> If the firm defines the termination as a goodbye scenario, the firm should be guided by a business model that says, "What's the least expensive way of terminating this relationship?" <sssss> And Board members should ask tough questions about paying too much. <sssss> AUWIEDERSEHEN SCENARIO "Auwiedersehen" is German for "Until we meet again." <sssss> It has a more open-ended quality than the English "goodbye." <sssss> In an auwiedersehen scenario, the assumption is that once employees physically leave the building, they may continue to be a factor in the firm's future. <sssss> But it is unclear what that factor may be. <sssss> After their non-compete contracts are over, they may join a smaller competitor and become potential allies or opponents in your firm's efforts to develop strategic alliances or acquire the firm. <sssss> They may join firms that touch your industry and become potential referral sources of new business for you or a potential source of caution to others about using your company. <sssss> They may attend alumni programs at their schools and encourage/discourage graduates from joining your firm. <sssss> Each of these scenarios assumes capability of retaliation plus uncertainty of retaliation. <sssss> The best practical defense in terminating employees under these conditions is "Treat people with dignity on the way out because the assured costs of such positive treatment are less than the potential downside retaliatory risks. <sssss> AUWIEDERSEHEN VS IT'S NICE TO BE NICE We work with companies that treat departing leaders with dignity on the grounds that "it is good public relations and good for morale if we help former employees achieve a `soft landing.'" <sssss> This positive rationale works only in cultures supportive of such a rationale. <sssss> The Schelling rationale does not depend on an organizion having a specific culture for treating people with dignity. <sssss> It develops a contingency approach to management based on a risk assessment. <sssss> There may be times when a "goodbye" scenario does indeed make good sense. <sssss> There are other times when "auwiedersehen" makes better economic sense. <sssss> In applying Professor Schelling's theories, management's failure to take defensive measures with those possessing abilities and options to retaliate is is just bad economics. <sssss> One sees it at work every day. <sssss> (...)
Chris		Being Perfect: Books: Anna Quindlen		1		What a disappointment! <sssss> Based on reviews, I couldn't wait to get this book. <sssss> Don't let the 48 pages fool you...half of the pages are pictures, and the half with writing on them are double-spaced with wide margins. <sssss> Took me all of 20 minutes to read (and only that long because of all the page turning). <sssss> Nothing wrong with being concise....except that the philosophy here is overly simplified. <sssss> Quindlen goes to great lengths to equate "Pefection" with "Conformity" and condemning it as inauthentic. <sssss> I do believe that women tend to set unrealistic expectations for themselves (i.e., wanting to be the perfect mother, perfect daughter, perfect wife, perfect businesswoman); therefore, it creates warm, fuzzy feelings to hear someone criticize perfection as being "boring". <sssss> Unfortunately, to claim that "[well-behaved women] don't make good lawyers....or businesswomen" just doesn't follow. <sssss> This is not deep reading. <sssss> 20 minutes? <sssss> Don't waste your time.
S. Whiteside		The Bancroft Strategy: Books: Robert Ludlum,Scott Sowers		1		The ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book. <sssss> It was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real Ludlum books
Reading Mom		A Year in the World: Journeys of A Passionate Traveller: Books: Frances Mayes		1		This book really irritated me. <sssss> I loved Mayes's previous books and was really looking forward to reading this one. <sssss> The concept, a year of traveling to different locations, seemed like it would be really interesting combined with Mayes' fresh perspectives, enthusiasm for discovery, feisty opinions and poetic descriptions. <sssss> But somehow it didn't work. <sssss> I get the sense that her heart wasn't really in this book. <sssss> Maybe because the trips were taken over a span of five years, and cobbled together? <sssss> Or because there's so much `padding' - endless quotes from her own or other people's writing. <sssss> When she liked the place, her descriptions feel artificially enthusiastic, almost as if the book was paid for by the chamber of commerce. <sssss> I got tired of reading that she could live there, or could imagine taking her grandson there, or wishes she was born there, or that it's SO much better than San Francisco. <sssss> Where she doesn't live anymore, and hasn't for years. <sssss> There are also too many stories about refreshing local characters who think Frances Mayes is the nicest, most tasteful, most interesting person they've ever met. <sssss> Especially since these people tend to be waiters, cab drivers, rug salesmen or others whose business depends on charming the tourists. <sssss> Most of the book consists of sneering at her fellow Americans, or talking about people's personal appearance. <sssss> This is boring and clich?d - and if you like that kind of thing, Bill Bryson does it better. <sssss> There's also way too much name dropping (she's always mentioning "my friend so-and-so, the famous ____"). <sssss> What happened to the ordinary, financially stretched, middle-aged college professor? <sssss> She seems to be taking on the persona of a celebrity. <sssss> She doesn't want to be crowded in with a group, doesn't want to associate with ordinary tourist types - now she deserves the VIP treatment. <sssss> This is definitely a change from her previous books. <sssss> I think when it comes right down to it, there's too much Frances Mayes in this book. <sssss> I thought I liked her, but what I really like is her writing style. <sssss> It can still be magical - when she gets her ego out of the way. <sssss> But when she puts herself front and center, she becomes more tedious and pretentious than interesting. <sssss> Now I'm sorry I read this book, because I'm afraid it will spoil my enjoyment of the earlier ones.
"reader999"		Psalms for Praying: An Invitation to Wholeness: Books: Nan C. Merrill		1		This is the first book I've ever returned. <sssss> While a lot of what she does is admirable and does work (the "You" form instead of "Lord/He" works very well), two things make it unusable: constant use of "Beloved" for the word "God" or "Lord" becomes irritating very quickly, and she subjectively pops out the word "enemies" wherever it appears and puts in "fears." <sssss> I wouldn't dare tell someone with AIDS or a refuge or whomever that their only enemy is their own fears, and even for others such overpersonalization doesn't work. <sssss> The classic 137th Psalm was unrecognizable -- where did the dolphins come from
L Smith "acozylover"		The EatingWell Healthy in a Hurry Cookbook: 150 Delicious Recipes for Simple, Everyday Suppers in 45 Minutes or Less: Books: Jim Romanoff,The Editors of EatingWell		2		I love to browse through different cookbooks. <sssss> I have quite a collection, and usually go to the library to find new recipes to try before I decide to purchase the entire book. <sssss> I normally look for 3 things in a cookbook, besides delicious recipes that will work for my family. <sssss> This includes: 1) Pictures of more than 3/4 of the recipes (Color pictures are the best) 2) A spiral binding, or at least one that easily lays flat 3) New pppppppppp innovative recipes that have ingredients I can easily find at a grocery store I also prefer if the cookbook lists all of the nutrient information including sodium, fat content, protein, fiber, and carbohydrates. <sssss> I picked up this book to find new ideas to make a quick meal in-between working and shuffling the kids to various sporting and school events. <sssss> Let's face it, eating out isn't always the best for you, especially since you cannot always tell exactly how much fat or sodium you are ingesting. <sssss> I wanted some new recipes to try, but not necessarily a dish that would have my kids eyeing it suspiciously and saying "what is it?". <sssss> I was not disappointed. <sssss> The book offered many beautiful color photographs, and the pages themselves were glossy and thick...not the cheaper paper that many cookbooks use. <sssss> All of the nutrient information was included, along with a column called "Nutrient Bonus" that lets you know if the dish contained a lot of Vitamin C, Calcium, etc. <sssss> The book was hard cover, but the binding was loose enough that my copy easily lays flat, another good bonus so that I was not always struggling to keep my page open. <sssss> It also contains a rather large vegetarian section. <sssss> Some of our favorites include: Seafood Salad with Citrus Vinaigrette, Bistro Beef Salad, Vietnamese Style Beef pppppppppp Noodle Broth, Mock Risotto, Chicken Stuffed with Golden Onions pppppppppp Fontina, Almond Crusted Chicken Fingers, Beer-Battered Tilapia with Mango Salsa, and Loaded Twice Baked Potatoes. <sssss> Enjoy!
Robert L Stevenson		Horses, Hitches and Rocky Trails: Books: Joe Back		2		This is probably the single best work I've ever seen on the pppppppppp quot;science pppppppppp quot; of packing. <sssss> Joe Back lived and worked in N.W. <sssss> Wyoming, and was a legend in the area. <sssss> His humorous annecdotes, and extremely accurate hand drawn diagrams, combined with his obvious knowledge of the subject, make this a pppppppppp quot;must have pppppppppp quot; for anyone seriously interested in learning how to pack horses or mules, and survive. <sssss> This little work deserves a place in any packer's library
Thomas Del Corro		The Carolina Way: Leadership Lessons from a Life in Coaching: Books: Dean Smith,Gerald D. Bell,John Kilgo,Roy Williams		2		On the way to a conference in New Orleans, my flight from Raleigh to Charlotte was cancelled due to mechanical problems, and I was booked on a flight to D.C. As I boarded the plane with pppppppppp quot;The Carolina Way pppppppppp quot; under my arm, a gentleman seated at the front of the plane asked how I was enjoying the book. <sssss> I explained that I had not yet started the book, so I could not give an answer. <sssss> The gentleman followed me to my seat and introduced himself as Dr. Gerald Bell, the co-author of pppppppppp quot;The Carolina Way pppppppppp quot;. <sssss> Myself a Carolina fan, I was pleased to meet Dr. Bell, as he spent several minutes talking about Coach Smith, whom I have admired for over forty years, and the UNC basketball program, which is presently undergoing a much needed resurgence under Coach Roy Williams. <sssss> Dr. Bell's contributions to the book tie Coach Smith's leadership philosophy to practical business applications by relating wonderful anecdotal references from Carolina's storied history to today's business situations. <sssss> Surely, Coach Smith, given his ability to recruit top players, has been criticized by many for his failure to win NCAA championships in the manner of Coach John Wooden at UCLA, but winning two NCAA championships, winning at a consistency high level unmatched by any program without violating strict NCAA rules, and coaching top players that graduated at a +90% rate and have gone on to be successes in their chosen professions underscore the unique successes of Coach Smith's pppppppppp quot;system pppppppppp quot;. <sssss> Teamwork, integrity, loyalty, and hard work, are the cornerstones of the Carolina Way, and anyone in the position of managing, leading, or molding young people today would benefit from reading this book, corny as it is at times. <sssss> This book is not just for Carolina basketball fans
S. Wisler		Pelican Brief: Books: John Grisham		2		This is the third book I have read by Grisham, and so far I have really enjoyed each one. <sssss> Grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller. <sssss> This book does not have any courtroom/court-case scenes, which I really enjoy, but it still kept my attention very well. <sssss> Grisham gives you just enough "inside details" to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer. <sssss> For example: at one point, the clues seemed to point to Fletcher Coal being involved in the killings, but that was way off the mark in the end. <sssss> This characteristic of Grisham's writings makes for a very enjoyable read. <sssss> One of my few complaints about this book is the sudden romance between Gray and Darby. <sssss> They had hardly even met before they seemed to become attracted, then it VERY quickly blossomed into an open show of affection, even though at the same time, Darby was supposedly mourning for Thomas. <sssss> Even so, that is probably the main thing that seems wrong about this book, and it does not detract from the overall quality very much at all. <sssss> Overall, this is a very captivating, page-turner book that really holds your attention. <sssss> I highly recommend it, as well as Grisham's other books. <sssss> So far, I have found Grisham to be an awesome writer of legal thrillers. <sssss> I promise that you will not be disappointed. <sssss> Read and enjoy
J. Glenn "J. Glenn"		The Blind Assassin: Books: Margaret Atwood,Margot Dionne		1		Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down. <sssss> It was almost aggravating
Nicole M. Walters		Sunset in St. Tropez (Danielle Steel): Books: Danielle Steel		1		This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. <sssss> I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. <sssss> The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. <sssss> If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo
P. Uren		JPod: A Novel: Books: Douglas Coupland		1		I'm really a great fan of Douglas Coupland, which is perhaps much of the reason I found this book so disappointing. <sssss> I hate the fact that it has been dubbed the new Microserfs, since it totally lacks the insight, wit and 'funny because its true' apsects of the original. <sssss> About the only thing it has in common with Microserfs is the fact that its set in the same industry. <sssss> jPod is set in a landscape of unreality, with no apparent reason than to make a series of whacky adventures for eccentric, and for the most part unlikeable, characters. <sssss> It certainly doesnt reflect the IT industry of today, and the members of the jPod really only seem to represent those aspects of this community which give programmers a bad reputation, as essentially dysfunctional (autistic) as they are. <sssss> There doesnt even seem to be any real focus for this story. <sssss> I felt like I was mostly reading about a heap of stuff that 'happened'. <sssss> Its not all bad, and there were more than a few humorous moments, and interesting plot twists. <sssss> Coupland's highly approachable and fast moving writing style hasn't changed. <sssss> Its really just the subject matter and whatever its trying to communicate that seems to have fallen in a heap, in this book. <sssss> I normally devour all of his books within a day or two, and want to read them again soon after, but it was a real struggle just to get through this one to the end
"intentaccess"		Interaction of color: Books: Josef Albers		2		This book was so different from what I thought it was about when I ordered it. <sssss> It still was knowledgeable. <sssss> It is hard to grasp as you must actually do the experimentation. <sssss> I also thought the illustrations should be in color since that is what the book is about. <sssss> It has some examples in the beginning of the book but I hate to keep looking around in books I personally like it to appear in front of me as I read. <sssss> It was a very interesting book to say the least
doomsdayer520		And the Money Kept Rolling In (and Out): Wall Street, the IMF, and the Bankrupting of Argentina: Books: Paul Blustein		2		There are many books out there about the supposed strengths or weaknesses of globalization and free trade, but at least in terms of the international movement of capital, you'll usually find mere boosterism and ideology. <sssss> At last, Paul Blustein has given us a look at the real-life effects of financial shenanigans and speculation on the lives of real people in a developing nation. <sssss> Here we have an in-depth and incredibly informative examination of the global financial trends that led to the horrendous collapse of Argentina's economy in 2001-2002, which resulted in millions and millions of people descending into poverty and hardship. <sssss> You won't be surprised to see the word "bubble" regularly, as Blustein covers the surprisingly slow-moving factors that added up to disaster over several years, with many mistakes made by all parties along the way. <sssss> In addition to some financial mismanagement and damaging internal politics within Argentina itself, Blustein also explains errors made by the IMF and the Clinton and Bush administrations, and unhealthy speculation by foreign investors who had no regard for the outcomes of their actions. <sssss> Not to mention, Argentina was the punching bag for an international monetary system that is built to ensure short-term rewards for speculators, plus an ideology that believes it to be acceptable when elites in rich countries profit while regular people in developing nations are left holding the bag when the bubble bursts. <sssss> I would also recommend this book for those with a general interest in international monetary matters, as Bluestein does a marvelous job explaining phenomena like currency exchange rates, international debt and equity markets, and other financial concepts that you may wish to understand more deeply. <sssss> If you're an ideologue in love with the supposed panacea of free markets, thinking that the unfettered movement of capital around the world will raise all ships, you might have your worldview shot down by Blustein and his excellent look at Argentina's misery. <sssss> [~doomsdayer520~
L. E. Camp "heidentor"		The Secret of the Runes: Books: Stephen E. Flowers,Guido von List		2		Guido von List was the leader of the Armanen-Orden, the single most important magical order of the 20th century. <sssss> This book deserves to be on every thinking Germanic Heathen and Magician's bookshelf... <sssss> Many of List's ideas influenced the most important thinkers of the modern Heathen revival, including Edred Thorsson... <sssss> The Armanen-Orden still survives in Germany, and von List's Futhork is no less powerful today than it was when it was revealed to him in 1903. <sssss> In English speaking lands the Knights of Runes continues his tradition. <sssss> BUY THIS BOOK
A. Ross		City of Glass (The New York Trilogy, Vol 1): Books: Paul Auster		1		The first book of Auster's New York trilogy was originally published in 1985, and in 1994 was adapted into this graphic novel. <sssss> I've never read the original (or any of the other parts of the trilogy), so I can't comment on Karasik and Mazzicchelli's adaptation. <sssss> However, I can say that since I'm not particularly fond of existentialist or postmodernist literature (those two terms being the most common critical shorthand for Auster's story), this really didn't do anything for me at all. <sssss> The story is basically an exercise in metafiction, and if you like that stuff, great -- I do not. <sssss> It is dressed up (at least initially) in the mystery genre, but that's just window dressing. <sssss> (There's a long legacy, especially in France, of cloaking novels and films of ideas in genre trappings (for example Alain Robbe-Grillet's two books The Erasers and The Voyeur, or the films of Jean-Pierre Melville.) <sssss> The story begins fairly straightforwardly: a reclusive writer of potboiler mysteries named Daniel Quinn lives in New York on his own since the death of his wife and son. <sssss> A complete stranger calls him and thinks Quinn is a private detective named Paul Auster and begs him to to take his case. <sssss> (The writer Paul Auster, and his family, shows up for one scene -- it's that kind of book.) <sssss> Quinn meets with the strange man, who was raised in rather harrowing circumstances by his professor father, who was seeking to discover the true language of God. <sssss> The father has been released from jail and Quinn is supposed to keep an eye on him and report. <sssss> Everything starts to derail when he loses track of both the old man he's been following, and his clients. <sssss> He spends several months watching the building and going crazy. <sssss> Once he realizes they've disappeared, he finds his own life has disappeared as well. <sssss> Obviously this is all somewhat about identity, but it's more about fun stuff like language, representation, and other tiresome postmodern subjects (as are the other two parts of the trilogy, which involve a man spying on someone, and yet another disappearance). <sssss> It has to be said that the artwork does an admirable job of treating the bizarro world Auster has thrust his characters into. <sssss> The simple, heavy black and white inking is a perfect match to the material, especially when the representations become less literal and more symbolic. <sssss> However, if your taste runs more toward things like plots and characters, this is probably not for you. <sssss> Fans of Auster may enjoy this, but fans of the graphic novel form are probably going to be much less keen.
Melissa J. Reed "melissajreed"		Message in a Bottle: Books: Nicholas Sparks		1		I'll preface this by saying I'm a cryer. <sssss> I cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining. <sssss> I cried all the way through Superman Returns. <sssss> I did not, however, shed one tear during Message in a Bottle. <sssss> In English class, I always learned to "show, not tell" when writing. <sssss> When that is your rule of thumb, you'll write a moving piece of literature, even if you're not completely skillful. <sssss> Sparks is the master of telling without showing. <sssss> I'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews it gets. <sssss> The story is somewhat engaging, but with no payoff. <sssss> But the work is filled with passages like (and these are from memory; if I picked up the book to look for verbatim examples I'd have to type the entire thing), "He went to the refrigerator, opened the door, and took a beer. <sssss> After opening it, he sat down on the back deck." <sssss> Or, "Though she was overweight, she moved quickly around the table." <sssss> "She got out of the shower, dried off, and put on khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt." <sssss> Have you read enough yet? <sssss> I'm new to the romance genre. <sssss> My mother-in-law recommended Sparks because -- I think she was trying to imply -- his sex scenes aren't too graphic. <sssss> They were to me, but then, I'm new to romance, and spoiled by the masterful, unequaled storytelling skill of Stephen King. <sssss> Please hold your New York Times bestsellers to a higher standard. <sssss> Let's hold on to whatever quality control we can in music, movies, and literature
Janet L. Lubin		The Essential Guide to Hysterectomy: Complete Advice from a Gynecologist on Your Choices Before, During, and After Surgery-Including the Latest Treatment Options and Alternatives: Books: Lauren F. Streicher		2		I loaned my copy of Dr. Streicher's book to my mother who thought she may need a hysterectomy. <sssss> My mother reported that Dr. Streicher's book had information on topics she couldn't find elsewhere -- even about laparoscopic procedures which she hadn't heard about before. <sssss> Dr. Streicher's book helped educate my mother so that she was an informed patient and knew what questions to ask her own doctor. <sssss> Fortunately, it was determined that my mother did not need to have a hyesterectomy. <sssss> My only problem with this book is getting my copy back from my mother. <sssss> I may need to purchase a new one. <sssss> I think it is a "must-have" for any woman 40+ -- even for men whose partners/spouses/girlfriends are facing this
plainsdweller		Playing in the Dark : Whiteness and the Literary Imagination: Books: Toni Morrison		1		The reviewer below who said "More Heat Than Light" got it partly right. <sssss> This book is SO badly written you have to wonder if the author's other works were written by the same person. <sssss> Not only is it sophomoric, it is gibberish. <sssss> Had its author been unknown, she would surely have had to pay for the book's publication. <sssss> Incredibly bad, it may at least serve as a source of hope for struggling writers who believe that only the best works are accepted by publishers
Zecon		The Good Society: The Humane Agenda: Books: John Kenneth Galbraith		1		Mr. Galbraith is smart, accomplished, and learned man who knows what is best for all us. <sssss> His view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia. <sssss> Rather than a completely coercive state directing the actions of its citizens to some hirer calling, Mr. Galbraith aims to be `practical' and just further defines the third way. <sssss> Nonetheless, his proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and it is more attuned to the European model of society. <sssss> Many of his proposals are so silly you won't take them seriously. <sssss> But sadly, he is quite serious. <sssss> For example, Mr. Galbraith states that in a good society everyone should have a rewarding life. <sssss> Of course, he never defines the standard by which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding. <sssss> Neither does he address what one should do if their life is un-rewarding and what the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life. <sssss> And, of course, who is the `rewarding life judge' and does this judge have the authority of the state to take something from someone (who has a life that is deemed too rewarding) for someone who has life that is too un-rewarding. <sssss> Mr. Galbraith fails to convince the reader of the practicality of his proposals and ends up straddling a line between socialism and capitalism, and saying nothing new
N. Ward		Your Money or Your Life: Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independence: Books: Joe Dominguez,Vicki Robin		1		This has to be one of the most ridiculous books I have ever read. <sssss> At one point the authors ask: if money equals security, wouldn't you feel safe walking through a major American city at midnight with a suitcase full of cash handcuffed to your wrist? <sssss> If money really did equal security, you would! <sssss> I stopped reading after that. <sssss> I will say, however, that this book cured me of all of my bad financial habits. <sssss> I never want to be so bad off as to look to a book like this for advice again.
VA Gator		Two-Dollar Bill (Stone Barrington Novels): Books: Stuart Woods		1		I had this one figured out by the second chapter. <sssss> Too predictable and shallow. <sssss> Hopefully, the next Stone book will actually be worth reading
C. Gilbert "frumiousb"		The Ink Dark Moon: Love Poems by Ono no Komachi and Izumi Shikibu, Women of the Ancient Court of Ja pan: Books: Jane Hirshfield		2		Jane Hirshfield and Mariko Aratani have done a marvelous job with the translation of these lovely tanka-- manages to capture both their fragility and robust complexity. <sssss> I had a friend who was a Japanese scholar, who explained to me once the complexity of translating waka. <sssss> I have nothing but admiration for those who can do it well. <sssss> Hirshfield actually has an essay at the back of this book called "On Japanese Poetry and the Process of Translation". <sssss> I recommend it highly, even if you do not normally read this kind of essay. <sssss> I am a little bit afraid that the focus on the love poems and the emphasis on Ono no Komachi and Izumi Shikibu as female writers may give the wrong idea about the strength and importance of the poetry. <sssss> Shikibu is widely considered the greatest poet of her period and Ono no Komachi was one of the Rokkasen-- the six best waka poets of the early Heian period. <sssss> The reason that I am not giving this volume five stars is because of this packaging and not because of the poetry itself. <sssss> These poems are a joy to read aside from any issues of scholarship. <sssss> They are strong and sad and very affecting. <sssss> There is actually no stronger recommendation to read this than the poems themselves, so I will close this review with one of the poems by Shikibu: What is the use of cherishing life in spring? <sssss> Its flowers only shackle us to this world
Alex Pulaski		The Italian Secretary: Books: Caleb Carr		1		I'm a Conan Doyle fan and found The Alienist to be a pretty good read, so I made the unfortunate mistake of buying this book in softcover without taking a gander inside. <sssss> Carr seems to think he can ride his reputation for 316 pages without putting much thought into whether anyone along for the trip will get some enjoyment out of it. <sssss> The dialogue is flat, the plot uncompelling and Carr relies on the near-endless use of exclamation points to inject some excitement!!! <sssss> into this tale, which left me skipping pages at a time as it neared its conclusion because I couldn't bear to read the mangled sentences. <sssss> This book has no climax -- just, thankfully, an ending. <sssss> Spend your money on something worth reading.
Katrina Stone		Evolutionary Witchcraft: Books: T. Thorn Coyle		1		That so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me. <sssss> Luckily, I bought this book used, otherwise I might be kicking myself for paying full price. <sssss> Between her utterly uninspired "devotional dances" to things such as sex, wisdom, and the "Sticky One" (a term she made up for the astral body), and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to "anoint" it, I was unimpressed, to say the least. <sssss> However, driving on a trip a friend and I got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book. <sssss> It's very, very amusing if you don't take it seriously. <sssss> The thing that makes me sad is that she's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth. <sssss> There's nothing evolutionary about it, unless you consider being a wanton, idiotic freak "evolutionary". <sssss> If this is what humanity is evolving into, I am frightend
displacedhuman "displacedhuman"		Joe College: Books: Tom Perrotta		2		The narrator of Joe Perrotta's novel "Joe College" is Danny, an English major at Yale. <sssss> Stuck with the peculiarities of his roommates, and with a horrendous crush on a fellow student named Polly, Danny struggles to complete his junior year. <sssss> While home in New Jersey on a summer break, Danny drives his father's lunch wagon "The Roach Coach." <sssss> And this is how he meets Cindy, a pleasant, chatty secretary. <sssss> Danny compares her to the girls on the Yale campus, and the comparison is not flattering to Cindy. <sssss> He's faintly embarrassed by her, and while she's ok to date when he's home in New Jersey, he's ashamed of the relationship when he returns to Yale. <sssss> Once again, Perrotta presents the theme of escape from New Jersey, and in the novel, Danny's escape is temporarily through Yale, but ultimately through education. <sssss> Cindy represents everything Danny is trying to escape--a lifetime driving the Roach Coach, and Danny knows far too many people who made huge mistakes and ended up trapped forever in New Jersey. <sssss> Class is another theme in the novel--during the school year, Danny works in a cafeteria. <sssss> The employees and the Townies are all too well aware that their lives are mapped out--whereas the Yale students seem to have vast, limitless opportunities. <sssss> While Danny's background is humble, and his parents have made tremendous sacrifices to send him to Yale, he rubs shoulders with peers who come from incredibly wealthy homes. <sssss> To them, Yale doesn't quite hold the desperate stakes that face Danny. <sssss> When it comes to making some rather questionable moral choices, Danny nakedly examines his motives, and simply shrugs. <sssss> While this does not make Danny a heroic narrator, it certainly makes him very real and very human. <sssss> As a Perrotta fan, I hope that the author rediscovers Danny in another novel. <sssss> In "Joe College" Danny's moral fibre is still quite plastic, and he may prove to be fascinating in middle age--displacedhuma
Boz		World's Fairs and the End of Progress: An Insider's View: Books: Alfred Heller		2		Since I am a World's Fair "fanatic" I have read almost everything that I can on the subject. <sssss> In general, this is an interesting and well researched book. <sssss> The author has apparently attended most of the expositions that he writes about. <sssss> However, I must point up three rather glaring errors in the book. <sssss> In describing the Louisiana World Expo of 1984 he states that the unbuilt symbol tower was supposed to be "80 feet tall,just 150 feet shorter than the Eiffel Tower." <sssss> Since the Eiffel Tower is actually over 900 feet tall,the New Orleans fair tower would have had to have been at least 800 feet tall.This may have been a typo which the author did not catch in time.The other error states that the US Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair of 1958 was a "large,squat,round concrete block structure." <sssss> It was indeed large and round, but not squat and not made of concrete blocks.According to the excellent book about Edward Durrell Stone, the architect of the pavilion,the outer walls consisted of large aluminum panels which were latticed in intricate designs so that the interior would be flooded with natural light. <sssss> I have seen photos of the US Pavilion, and it seems a beautiful and airy structure to me. <sssss> (In comparison to the Soviet Pavilion, which resembled a large refrigerator!) <sssss> Thirdly, the Spokane Expo of 1974 was not the first time that the U.S.S.R. exhibited at a U.S. expo. <sssss> They had a large pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1939. <sssss> All in all, however, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of World's Fairs
Worldreels		Ageless Body, Timeless Mind: The Quantum Alternative to Growing Old: Books: Deepak Chopra		1		AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize the word "old" as in old age. <sssss> The writer has a knack for making common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound concepts. <sssss> His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies. <sssss> But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound. <sssss> If you like poetry, Deepak may be your read: "The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)" Or try to interpret this one: "The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. <sssss> (P.40)" At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible. <sssss> He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over "intelligent design." <sssss> He can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved. <sssss> He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process. <sssss> Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself. <sssss> Whether your word game tosses in the word "quantum" or not doesn't change much. <sssss> What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world. <sssss> I wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane
Brien Louque		The Greatest Stories Never Told: 100 Tales from History to Astonish, Bewilder, and Stupefy: Books: Rick Beyer		1		I'm an avid reader of history, as well as processing a degree in the subject. <sssss> So imagine my surprise when, after receiving this book from a friend of mine for Christmas, I read the erroneous account of the Children's Crusade of 1212. <sssss> I had done research on this topic, so I was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred. <sssss> Had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years? <sssss> If he had, he would have realized that there were actually two crusades - one consisting of mainly French people led by Stephen of Cloyes who, when told to turn back by King Philip II, did so. <sssss> That ended that crusade. <sssss> The other one, led by a shepherd from Germany named Nicholas, led a group across the Alps into Italy. <sssss> Some left for home while others continued on to Rome. <sssss> It's interesting to note that in Rome, many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these "children" were either too old or because they were pregnant. <sssss> Perhaps until relatively recently, people believed in the Children's Crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles (like Chronica Albrici monachi Trium Fontium) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred, rather than relying on more contemporary sources. <sssss> Nor did they realize that the latin word "pueri" used in the chronicles can have several meanings (such as unmarried men rather than children). <sssss> In the final analysis, you just can't rely on books like these to really teach you history. <sssss> The best you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it. <sssss> If only the author had bothered to check the History Channel's own account of the Children's Crusade on their website, or perhaps read the excellent paper done by Peter Raedts in the Journal of Medieval History, or even just checked out the brief but accurate entry online in wikipedia. <sssss> The book gave two pages to this event, and sadly got it completely wrong. <sssss> For this gross oversight, I am compelled to give it one star. <sssss> Readers of history, never just believe what you read - verify
A reader		What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About(TM): Premenopause, Balance Your Hormones and Your Life from Thirty to Fifty: Books: John Lee,Jesse Hanley,Virginia Hopkins		2		OMG!!! <sssss> I could not put this book down... <sssss> I am in my upper twenties and I am going thru a bunch of these symptoms already. <sssss> Yes the book is bios about natural progesterone, so what... <sssss> I have not personally used progesterone cream yet, because I am waiting for my saliva test results to make sure that's what I need. <sssss> But even if I don't, everything else provided in the book is amazing information. <sssss> Your diet, your vitamins, your stress level, your physical activity, everything is co-related to most woman's hormonal imbalances. <sssss> They even talked about a case where a woman did not want to use the natural progesterone and how by changing all of the other stuff in her life, she achieved hormone balancing. <sssss> If you are suffering from hormonal imbalances, I will strongly recommend this book. <sssss> I also bought other ones that I will be reading after this one. <sssss> But I started with "Be Lean by Romy Seleznov", which is a story from her life and how she struggled to balance her hormones and gives all the details of what she did, then I continued with this book, and the next one I will be reading is "Natural Hormone Balance for Women" by Uzzi Reiss, which does cite this book as well. <sssss> If you think you have a hormonal imbalance, please do not rely on your doctor 100%, I am not saying that you should not believe them or rule out everything they say, but do your homework. <sssss> I have been telling my doctors since I am in my TEENS that I feel I have an imbalance with my hormones and since all of the results come back fine they have been telling me that my symptoms were "normal"... <sssss> WRONG!!! <sssss> Now they found a tumor in my pituitary gland, which causes an imbalance... <sssss> The tumor grows slowly, so I am sure that it has been there for years, but they never checked it before. <sssss> Now that I am treating it, all of my "normal" symptoms are almost gone. <sssss> I am still on the process of getting everything in balance. <sssss> If you feel you have something wrong, even if the results of your blood work comes as normal, READ more and look for healthy ways of changing your diet, exercising more, balance your hormones, and look for second opinions and definitely have a good naturopath that you can go to. <sssss> Also "Bikram Yoga", is an excellent exercise to helping you with hormonal balancing. <sssss> At least that's part of what I changed.
Robert Reardon		The Slippery Slope (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 10): Books: Lemony Snicket,Tim Curry		2		Best of the series so far. <sssss> Alternating the action between the two older siblings in one chapter and Sunny in the next really worked for me
"happycapy22"		Dave Barry Turns 50: Books: Dave Barry		2		I learnde so much from this book! <sssss> I laughed(yes! <sssss> ), I cried(not really), and I had the time of my life. <sssss> This is a great book. <sssss> I've only been around since the late 80s so a lot of jokes were kinda way above me. <sssss> But I still enjoyed it! <sssss> Herman's Armpits forever (har har
Jeffrey T. Monroe		Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics: Books: Henry Hazlitt		1		Book is out of date with modern economic thought. <sssss> Essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets.
PxDx "one of those 'book people'"		When Character Was King: A Story of Ronald Reagan: Books: Peggy Noonan		1		Pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers, whose very existence and relevance is due to that king. <sssss> What you will get from that kind of writing? <sssss> Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration. <sssss> Sound familiar? <sssss> Noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings. <sssss> Probably she does not care. <sssss> Americans are lucky that they never had any king. <sssss> Noonan fails to provide any inside information how Reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - AIDS, Iran-Contra, welfare, deficits, funding mujahideens, cozy relationship with Saddam. <sssss> Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler, happy citizens..."happily lived ever after". <sssss> Basically, this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer. <sssss> Her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers don't know already. <sssss> This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80's (which is nothing new in human civilizations). <sssss> Secondly, she fails to understand that Reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working Americans. <sssss> But she gives ALL the credits to Reagan, except all the negative things, like Iran-Contra. <sssss> In the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash - a perfect place for the kings, characters of kings and the writings about them
nerd		Color Atlas pppppppppp Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology: Books: Thomas B. Fitzpatrick,Richard Johnson,K. Wolff,Richard Suurmond		2		Used this in medical school. <sssss> Excellent resource. <sssss> In my time google and yahoo were not around, so this was the quick source. <sssss> now that [...] is around, not as necessary, but still valuable. <sssss> There is a pediatric version as well. <sssss> High yield
Judy in VEGAS "Judy"		The Team-By-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball: Books: Dennis Purdy,Tony La Russa		2		This is the best baseball book ever! <sssss> Not only is it beautifully organized and rich with facts, but it's so well written! <sssss> As someone who came late to baseball, I find the book hard to put down. <sssss> IF you can only buy one baseball book, this is it--it's a major reference for any fan, and it's going to make a great holiday gift too. <sssss> Get your copy before they're all gone
B. Chandler "xyzzy"		Web Design Studio Secrets: Books: Deke McClelland,Katrin Eismann,Terri Stone,Steve Broback		1		Some times it is nice to have a book that points out the obvious. <sssss> You can be too close to a problem to notice the obvious. <sssss> Unfortunately this book is too obvious. <sssss> And it is all fluff with no substance. <sssss> Wait you say. <sssss> This is a design book what do you want? <sssss> Code? <sssss> I really wanted design. <sssss> So where is it? <sssss> Between the pages that tell how to use exotic tools to do what html can? <sssss> Or is it between the lines that keep emphasizing speed? <sssss> Or is it that this is one big advertisement for the contributors? <sssss> Oh well, it makes you look scholarly to have this book on the Koffee table
realmartha		The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success as You Start, Grow, or Manage a Business: Books: Martha Stewart		1		Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a "business decision"? <sssss> I would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this "criminal spectacle" designed to make the question of Martha/Mdiddy's innocence a moot point. <sssss> Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? <sssss> By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? <sssss> How important is integrity to a leader...former CEO of a company? <sssss> Be "thoughtful
William J. Ussery		The Orchard Keeper (Neglected Books of the Twentieth Century): Books: Cormac McCarthy		2		I am informally studying Cormac having read his last works first, namely "No Place for Old Men", preceeded by the "Trilogy" and "Blood Meridian". <sssss> His precise knowledge about the area and customs of his story and the minimilist language which he develops in the later novels is interesting to watch grow
		Sam and the Lucky Money: Books: Karen Chinn,Cornelius Van Wright,Ying-Hwa Hu		2		my three year old loves this and I do too! <sssss> it is a great book to share at Xmas as well. <sssss> The pictures are wonderful and we are giving it to nursery school as part of Chinese New Year celebration
Joseph W. Crespo "joe c"		The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century: Books: Thomas L. Friedman,Oliver Wyman		1		it is juust a copy of the frist book. <sssss> if you read the frist the world is flat, then don't waste your time. <sssss> jo
J. Bruck		The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture, and Consciousness (P.S.): Books: Virginia Postrel		1		I was disappointed with this purchase. <sssss> If you read the book jacket, you have gotten about all of the information out of it that's coming.
Dr. John J. Obrien		The Oxford Companion to United States History: Books: Paul S. Boyer		2		This volume contains entries that deal with concepts, events, persons, and movements in u.s. history. <sssss> The length of the entries is appropriate to the topic considered. <sssss> In addition, the entires both inform the reader with up-to-date information and indicate how revisionist historians have resahped opionions or refocused the discipline. <sssss> The entries are clearly written and eminently readable. <sssss> They are persuasive in thier opionions, yet respectful of other stances. <sssss> The cross references are helpful and ample. <sssss> The same obtains for the bibliographies. <sssss> The Oxford Companion to U.S. History far surpasses some other contemporary dictionaries in U.S. history. <sssss> Its articles are treated in more depth and greater nuances. <sssss> The entries in the other dictionaries are too short and far too superficial. <sssss> I would highly recommend this for people involved in serious historical study and research
onlyInSF		Temper Your Child's Tantrums (Pocket Guides): Books: James Dobson		1		Pinching a child's trapezius muscle? <sssss> Hitting him or her with a belt or a stick hard enough for it to hurt? <sssss> James Dobson should be put away. <sssss> Raising children this way may make them obedient to their parents, but they will be prone to abuse others once they reach adulthood. <sssss> Look at Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein. <sssss> At best, children who are physically abused will grow up to practice BSDM. <sssss> This book deserves no stars
Charles Darwin		A Theory of Justice: Books: John Rawls		2		It's been several years since I read the book. <sssss> Saw it recently, the book seems to be a favorite, of the coffee-house, talky, chattering, left, Marx-Freud-Rousseau crowd. <sssss> However, all this at talk of a "just society" and the "underprivileged" can and does mean only one thing: A POLICE STATE. <sssss> Anytime, a so-called "theory" attempts to create a utopian state, there will be coercion. <sssss> Anytime, there is coercion, you will infringe upon individual rights, freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom to govern one's own life. <sssss> Instead of a "police state" in the form of a theory of justice. <sssss> He should have written a book titled "A Theory of Liberty" Any society without liberty as the foundation will have coercion and hence the destruction of liberty. <sssss> However, this book remains the coffee-house favorite. <sssss> Rawls was an "Ivory Tower Pinhead". <sssss> A brief bio states that he was a professor all his adult life. <sssss> What kind of adults spend their whole life having fake, phony, welfare for intellectual, make-believe jobs like being a professor of political theory. <sssss> What dat????? <sssss> Oh, Please get a real job. <sssss> #1. <sssss> THOSE CANNOT DO WILL TEACH..... <sssss> So much for the ivory tower pinhead. <sssss> A theory of justice will lead to a police state, a state of coercion. <sssss> What we need is theory of LIBERTY
Julia Lupton "design-your-life.org"		The Apron Book: Making, Wearing, and Sharing a Bit of Cloth and Comfort: Books: EllynAnne Geisel		1		I too eagerly anticipated reading this book, since I went through an apron-sewing blitz this summer. <sssss> I was a bit disappointed, however. <sssss> Although the photos and instructions are helpful (for seamsters more accomplished than myself), the tone of the book is reactionary, with negative statements about working mothers and a lot of nostalgia for the Ozzie and Harriet era. <sssss> Although Geisel celebrates the rebirth of the domestic arts, she praises the home-as-nest (enclave of traditional domesticity) rather than the house-as-studio (a DIY workshop involving every member in open-ended acts of engagement with economy, history, and culture.) <sssss> Still, there's some interesting history and some great photos
Ludwig P. Schulze "lpdds"		The Joy of Cooking: Revised and Expanded Edition: Books: Irma S. Rombauer,Marion Rombauer Becker		1		Found recipes dated, layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how-to is useful, its generally from another era. <sssss> Bought Gourmet cook book instead
Michael Sympson		Discourse On Inequality: Books: Jean-Jacques Rousseau		1		pppppppppp quot;I have received your new book against the human race, and thank you for it. <sssss> Never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid. <sssss> One longs, in reading your book, to walk on all fours. <sssss> But as I have lost that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it. <sssss> Nor can I embark in search of the savages of Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned render a European surgeon necessary to me; because war is going on in those regions; and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves. <sssss> pppppppppp quot; Voltaire (1755
JR Pinto		The Professor of Desire: Books: Philip Roth		2		This is the first novel by Philip Roth that I actually like. <sssss> Portnoy's Complaint was a good hundred-page novella, spread out over a three-hundred page book; the other pages were filled with the dross of his political opinions, and his kvetching about his parents. <sssss> Operation Shylock was also too pre-occupied with pushing a political agenda (but just what agenda, we are never sure). <sssss> This is Roth's primary fault as an author - he is too didactic. <sssss> I find that I really don't care much about what Roth's political opinions are. <sssss> Ironically, this is probably one of the attributes that make him a critical darling - it shows that he thinks "deep thoughts." <sssss> The Professor of Desire is blessedly free of politics. <sssss> In it, Roth sticks with the subjects he knows best: sex and relationships. <sssss> Young David Kepesh is a sexually frustrated young student. <sssss> That changes while studying abroad in Swinging London, where he finds that what they say about Swedish girls is true. <sssss> Things take a turn for the worse after the end of his disastrous marriage finds him crushed by loneliness in New York. <sssss> With the help of a psychiatrist, Kepesh tries to discover if he will ever be able to commit to anyone or experience happiness. <sssss> The Professor of Desire finds Roth at a more mature place in his career. <sssss> Gone is the odious kvetching about his parents that polluted so much of Portnoy's Complaint; the parents in this book are treated with sympathy. <sssss> At one point, a character points out to Kepesh that there is no point in mining the workings of a Jewish family for his fiction anymore. <sssss> He is also less homophobic in this novel - but not much so. <sssss> There are still things about Roth's style that take getting used to; I don't think there's anything profound in his refusal to offset dialogue into separate paragraphs - it just makes it harder to keep track of who is speaking. <sssss> However, The Professor of Desire is a short, lyrical novel that is the best of anything I've read of his so far.
Virginia Allain "(retired librarian)"		Business Class: Etiquette Essentials for Success at Work: Books: Jacqueline Whitmore		2		Over the years I managed a staff, I grew concerned about the ignorance of basic business behavior among employees. <sssss> Asking a new staff member to read a book like this might head off some future conflicts. <sssss> Worth a try... maybe even highlight some sections that you feel are most important
A. J. Sutter		Exclusiveness and Tolerance: Studies in Jewish-Gentile Relations in Medieval and Modern Times (Scripta Judaica, 3.): Books: Jacob Katz		2		Before reading this book, I'd had a much more black-and-white (sc., mostly black) impression of Jewish life in medieval and early modern Europe. <sssss> This cogently-writtten volume presents a much more nuanced picture. <sssss> Ghetto walls were an injustice, but also a refuge for many Jews from the tense environment around them. <sssss> Oddly enough, this circumstance contributed to the relatively large number of conversions to Christianity in the liberal West after the Napoleonic liberations (in contrast to the shtetl Jews in Poland and Russia, who lived side-by-side with Gentile neighbors). <sssss> Katz's discussions of of Jewish martyrs during the First Crusade and the flexibility of rabbinic responsa, among other topics, are also quite fascinating.
varmint		The Internet Galaxy: Reflections on the Internet, Business, and Society: Books: Manuel Castells		1		My understanding is that this book is an accessible summary of the ideas Catsells presents in his three volume magnum opus, the Information Age (which starts with the Network Society). <sssss> If this is so, I am definitely not missing much by not having read the trilogy. <sssss> This is a really bad piece of sociology, characterized by a technologically deterministic analysis. <sssss> Why did I give it two stars instead of one then? <sssss> Well, it does have some OK parts. <sssss> Catsell's analysis of the origins of the internet is an interesting bit of the sociology of technology and what saves the book from pure technological determinism. <sssss> He also presents some convincing data (gathered by other people) that use of the internet for socializing does not suck people into an on-line world, alienating them from the world of face-to-face interaction; this happens in the case of a few troubled people, but most people use the internet to enhance their already existing off-line relationships. <sssss> The rest of the book basically argues that the network format of the internet is reshaping the rest of society in its image, with everything from big business to governments to social movements adopting a network form in response to the rise of this new technology. <sssss> This is, frankly, ludicrous reductionism. <sssss> It doesn't even stand up to a simple test of chronology--a lot of the developments that Castells argues are driven by the internet predate the explosion of ist usage in the mid-1990s. <sssss> As Castells himself admits, businesses were already taking on more of a network form before the internet appeared big time on the scene, and social movement scholars have shown the same is true of transnational social movements. <sssss> On top of this, Castells shows an effusive enthusiasm for all things networked, whether they be transnational corporations or the transnational social movements that oppose these same corporations. <sssss> I'm really at a loss to understand how one can enthuse about both of these opposed phenomena. <sssss> Castells does see some of the problems with the new network society--loss of job security and the digital divide, for instance--but he tends to downplay these. <sssss> And his solution to these problems tends to come down to more of the same--more internet access, more network social organization. <sssss> Talk about a narrow vision
W. CREED "Bill"		Killing Floor: Books: Lee Child		1		Amazingly tedious for a thriller. <sssss> Reacher is a good character, believable in his expertise, but a bit cold blooded in his use of violence. <sssss> The book takes too long to tell everything (and I mean everything) - it seems every minute of the week long plot is chronicled as is every thought Reacher has (many repeated over and over). <sssss> I hope Child fixed these flaws in later books.
Scott Tessier		The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project): Books: Chalmers Johnson		1		This is without a doubt the worst piece of social science ever produced. <sssss> Regardless of where you stand politically, Johnson is guilty of revisionist history to the worst degree. <sssss> Throughout this work Johnson displays a truly and utterly amazing ignorance of geopolitical realities.
"patoguerrero"		S M L XL: Second Edition: Books: Rem Koolhaas,Bruce Mau,Hans Werlemann		2		I've read, and re-read the book, although not it's full content, but randomly I open it and find a surprise each time. <sssss> I just love it
Christian Schlect		My Love Affair with Modern Art: Behind the Scenes with a Legendary Curator: Books: Katharine Kuh,Avis Berman		2		Those interested in American art of the last century will find great pleasure in reading this book. <sssss> Chicago and New York are the centers from which Katharine Kuh radiated. <sssss> As a museum curator, art dealer, and published critic, she was personally close to many of the modern masters. <sssss> In this book, she provides short but telling stories about their work and lives. <sssss> I especially liked the chapters on Rothko, Tobey and Noguchi. <sssss> Disparate side characters, such as Judge Learned Hand and LBJ, pop up and add further to the value of Ms. Kuh's memoir. <sssss> Avis Berman has done a great service to all those interested in the history of twentieth century American art by completing the memoirs of Katharine Kuh. <sssss> The author's reflections have been preserved in a form, while still true to the author, that is likely better than had the elderly Ms. Kuh herself remained alive to complete the job. <sssss> Notes to the text and a more complete description of Katharine Kuh's personal background are some of the very much-appreciated work accomplished by Ms. Berman
E Neel		American Foreign Relations: Books: Thomas G. Paterson,J. Garry Clifford,Kenneth J. Hagan		2		This book brings some of the items one read about in history classes to a more 'back channel' perspective. <sssss> Monroe Doctrine and the like are the opening situations, and instead of 'we put a blockade on German ship' it goes it to some of the things that happened to stop a war from breaking out
B. M. Chapman "bnio"		Mao Zedong: A Penguin Life (Penguin Lives): Books: Jonathan D. Spence		2		Only about two hundred pages, Jonathan Spence does a very noble job summarizing one of the most powerful, mysterious, fascinating, and frightening persons of the twentieth century. <sssss> Though if one is looking for a book that goes into detail about any aspect of Mao's life or policies, it is best to look elsewhere. <sssss> This book is a straightforward and unabashed introduction and quick overview of Mao's life and work and ideas. <sssss> Perfect for people curious about Mao and twentieth century China who want to read more than an abstract, but do not necessarily need or want to tackle a big and detailed work. <sssss> Just the facts and little commentary. <sssss> Spence does a good job balancing any bias against or for Mao and his policies and deals mostly with the reasons for them and overall consequences
Bill C.		War Without End: Israelis, Palestinians, and the Struggle for a Promised Land: Books: Anton LaGuardia		1		Author La Guardia mentions how the Lemba of Africa have the Jewish gene. <sssss> Fine! <sssss> But when he deals (in several pages mind you)with the Falashas (also of Africa) he never mentions that genetic studies have positively shown these Jews NOT to be descended from the 12 Tribes of Israel despite the Falashas's longtime rep for possibly being a Lost Tribe of Israel which, again, has now been 100% disproven through genetic studies
E. Hyland "Casual Reader"		The Alibi: Books: Sandra Brown		2		I love this book. <sssss> I listened to it on tape. <sssss> The storey started out a tiny bit slow but oh is the story good! <sssss> I recommend this book to anyone who likes romance, not real graphic but very sweet, and suspense. <sssss> Oh this book is so good. <sssss> Hammond Cross is the ideal man and Dr. Lad is just as sweet and classy as can be. <sssss> The end is the best. <sssss> Hammond struggles with doing what is right and what is ethical. <sssss> Very good book! <sssss> Two thumbs up to Ms. Brown!
William Polm "bill197"		Life After Life: Books: Raymond A., Jr. Moody		2		This is a warm and readable book about a fascinating subject: What happens at death, or near death? <sssss> It is written by a world renowned and respected scholar and medical doctor. <sssss> And, in spite of the fact that I am a Christian, with conservative beliefs, and even though I maintain my faith carefully focused on God, I do nevertheless give the accounts in this book some credence (along with its companion, written subsequently, "Life Beyond Death"). <sssss> I invite you to read it and see why
Ray Rae Goldman		Jimi Hendrix: The Man, the Magic, the Truth: Books: Sharon Lawrence		1		While I applaud Ms. Lawrence for educating fans on the gross injustices within the Hendrix family and for having a commendable understanding of Janie Hendrix's psychological make up that is lost even on many who are within her orbit, there are some very serious credibility problems here. <sssss> While even the idle Hendrix fan knows Jimi was born in King County Hospital, (Now Harbor View) Lawrence states he was born at the home of a family friend. <sssss> (Ouch) Jimi is quoted allegedly verbatum throughout the book but from some alledged tapes of interviews that no one has seen or heard and that Lawrence conveniently plans on destroying so 'no one can profit from them'.Meanwhile cigarette packs (yes, cigarette packs) and necklaces are being sold via ebay or to private collectors allegedly having belonged to Hendrix ,siting Ms. Lawrence as the previous owner and source of authenticity. <sssss> At one point she aledgedly quotes Hendrix as saying: "The LSD passed around San Francisco was a fabulous discovery for me, I'd taken acid in London but...." Aside from Jimi's use of the word 'fabulous' being at best incredulous, the fact that Hendrix had already tried LSD in New York in 1996 before going to England and subsequently Monterey is common knowledge among afficianados and again makes all of these alledged direct quotes questionable. <sssss> Those of you who have listened to and read the hundreds of hours of interviews available through collectors, official releases and press clippings will also find some of the wording of these alledged quotes that the book, and the credibility of it's author are based on, extremely suspect. <sssss> At one point Ms. Lawrence even offers an aledged quote from Hendrix's mother who passed away in 1958: "Jimi baby" she told her son "I have to escape this" While quotes like this can illicit an emotional response from the average reader,they are clearly fictional. <sssss> Throughout the book people close to Jimi are referenced but very sparsely quoted, if at all. <sssss> I shared the recount of Jimi's trip to Berkeley as a small child (Pg.5) with Jimi's aunt Delores and she laughed openly and wondered aloud where people come up with these stories. <sssss> This from a woman who was actually there and involved in planning said trip. <sssss> While making a reference to Ernestine Benson and misstakenly referring to her husband Cornel as "Bill" , Lawrence again allegedly quotes Hendrix in lieu of an actual interview with the Benson's who are both still living and have incredible first hand insights having lived with the Hendrix's. <sssss> Lawrence's assertion that Hendrix committed suicide simply because his journal was left out is no less ridiculous than Jimi's adopted stepsister Janie's claim that Jimi didn't OD. <sssss> Lawrence then stops just short of gleefully giving herself credit for Monika's suicide, but the jist is clear. <sssss> This book is more than a bit narcissistic with Lawrence lauding herself as much as she does her subject. <sssss> While proclaiming herself to be a close confident of Hendrix' the general consensus is that she wasn't around that much, if people even know who she is at all. <sssss> For a much more well researched and credible look into Jimi's life read Electric Gypsy or even more so , the new book Room Full Of Mirrors by Charles Cross. <sssss> The Man, The Magic, The Truth, while very dramatic, is rife with glaring inaccuracies and is for the most part a novel about the author and her subject, not a biography or a reliable historical record. <sssss> Unless these alledged tapes that are widely quoted throughout the entire book are made available, their legitimacy and the legitimacy of the book will forever be questioned. <sssss> Ray Rae Goldman Archivist/Historian James Marshall Hendrix Foundatio

Thanatipanonda "cal136"		Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture: Books: Apostolos Doxiadis		1		I want to make a short comment here: 1) This book is quite confusing. <sssss> It mixed up the real story with the make up one. <sssss> 2) Saying that Ramanujun thought Goldbach Conjecture is wrong was a huge mistake. <sssss> Everyone believe that Goldbach Conjecture is true. <sssss> And Ramanujun is a real genius. <sssss> I cannot stand this make up part

Rebecca "bookworm"		Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility: Books: Charles Berlitz		1		I really thought I would be able to learn about the Philadelphia Project from this book, considering the title. <sssss> However, the actual project doesn't make an appearence until the last chapter. <sssss> The entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place. <sssss> This book was disappoiting to an extreme.
Brainbuz		Mage: The Awakening, A Storytelling Game Of Modern Sorcery (Mage): Books: Mage		1		White Wolf wanted to revitalize a mature product line by rewriting it and they had problems with the old system that deserved fixing. <sssss> They did an excellent job on the core rules and the game mechanics are overall the best they've ever been. <sssss> One of the flaws of MAGE:Ascension was that it is dominated by the struggle between the Technocracy and the Traditions, in a manner that reflected Vampire:Masquerade's clan structure and Sabbat vs Camarilla. <sssss> One of the flaws of Vampire:Masquerade was that it had this whole history of "Caine as the first vampire and the Anti-Diluvians as the founders of the clans", that overshadowed the game. <sssss> In Mage:Ascension, Mages saw themselves as having evolved over time and that history had been re-written by the technocracy, so who really knew about the past? <sssss> In Awakening they took exactly what they were trying to jettison from Vampire and put it into Mage with the creation of Atlantis and the Exarchs. <sssss> The Societies that replace the traditions are not as interesting. <sssss> The replacement of Avatars with Towers doesn't make sense to me. <sssss> The eternal struggle theme remains with the Exarchs but seems a lot less important than the struggle over the consensus in Ascension. <sssss> Awakening is chock full or rotes. <sssss> For, Mage in a LARP, rotes are essential, shifting emphasis to rotes improves the compatibility of table top and live action systems, but detracts from the table top experience where Mages can do almost anything. <sssss> They split the Entropy Sphere into Death and Fate, which kind of makes sense, except that Death has too much overlap with Spirit. <sssss> I'm going to use the new Mechanics with the old world in my new campaign. <sssss> The new Mage setting doesn't inspire me like the old one did. <sssss> While the new Vampire and Werewolf settings may catch on, I think the new Mage is going to be a flop -- after the core book I don't expect to purchase any more of the supplements.

M. Cromwell		The Birth Order Effect for Couples: How Birth Order Affects Your Relationships - and What You Can Do About It: Books: Cliff Isaacson,Meg Schneider		1		While this book may give some basic ideas that are useful to keep in mind while you are trying to understand your relationships with others, in the end it is just another attempt to give people answers they want even though such answers don't exist. <sssss> I'll admit that being a first or second born might have a general effect on your personality, but just how far can we take this kind of analysis? <sssss> The author of this book goes so far to offer that by knowing your own birth order and that of your same-sex parent, he can determine the birth order of your ideal match. <sssss> My father was 3rd and I was 2nd, thus I should pair with a 4th born. <sssss> Anyone who thinks about that for five seconds should realize that it is totally bogus pseudo-science. <sssss> There are too many factors involved to be able to make such predictions. <sssss> Not every Nth born is the same, and no relationship between Nth and Mth borns can be analysed this way. <sssss> As with astrology, the only thing this book can do is unnecessarily deter you from pursuing relationships with people just because they are the wrong "sign". <sssss> Who's to say I won't get along with a 2nd born? <sssss> Rather than relying on voodoo like this, we are better off just paying attention to how we actually get along with other individuals

R. Rappaport		Dearly Devoted Dexter: A Novel: Books: Jeff Lindsay		1		I was not a huge fan of the first book, but the concept was interesting and some times a series gets better with each book. <sssss> This may not be the case here. <sssss> While it is not as forehead smacking dimwitted as the first, it is has it's moments of unbeleiveablity. <sssss> How can Dexter be so attractive that women throw themselves at him, and such a good pretender of being human that he can be oblivous when women like him? <sssss> The only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister, and I kind of think it might be only a matter of time. <sssss> I also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission. <sssss> Are they going to introduce a new character to be "on to him" every book? <sssss> This is not only frustrating but it shows that the author is completely incapable of developing any character or relationship longer than a few pages.
Chowhound "Linda"		Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise: Books: Ruth Reichl		2		I just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to NYC from Barcelona. <sssss> My mouth watered as I read the included reprints of her past reviews of NYC restaurants - even after my five days of fantastic Spanish cuisine! <sssss> But more surprisingly, I was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the NYC restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many "characters". <sssss> The book left me such respect for the depths that Ruth Reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience, especially in NYC's "best" restaurants. <sssss> Her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective (as objective as food tastes get, I suppose) review. <sssss> A very easy and enjoyable read.
J. Wasden "Marketing Thought Leader"		The Ultimate Question: Driving Good Profits and True Growth: Books: Fred Reichheld		2		This book is full of useful insights. <sssss> I was fortunate to hear Reichheld present this content at a seminar for marketing professionals. <sssss> While some reviewers have complained that his approach is overly simplistic, I doubt any of them have actually applied his methodology to their business. <sssss> I applied his methodology to my business (direct selling) and had over 6,000 interviews completed to identify promoters, passives and detractors in the businesses of independent distributors. <sssss> Consistent with Reichheld's findings, the segments of my business that were growing fastest had more promoters in their respective customer bases and were performing better across a wide range of metrics. <sssss> From the detailed findings, we identified best practices that were leveraged across the entire business. <sssss> Buy the book. <sssss> Have an open mind. <sssss> Apply the concepts he has laid out. <sssss> If you do, you will walk away with useful ideas to accelerate the growth of your business
Peter Lorenzi		The Number : A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life: Books: Lee Eisenberg		1		"The number" poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers. <sssss> A four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom, even if it is a number. <sssss> Eisenberg's number is the inverse of that draw down, or twenty-five times.... well, there's the rub, twenty-five times what? <sssss> income? <sssss> expenses? <sssss> income less savings? <sssss> projected discretionary spending? <sssss> Post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses? <sssss> The proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants, experts, philosophers, and casual acquaintances. <sssss> Eisenberg, a former Esquire editor and short-timer with Lands End, ruminates about a simple question: How much money do you need to feel secure? <sssss> The problem is that security comes in multiple forms: happiness, comfort, excess consumption, ego. <sssss> And the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be. <sssss> Constructing a one-year budget is hard enough. <sssss> Constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible. <sssss> Eisenberg doesn't help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses. <sssss> Doctors, divorcees, `downshifters', and very little real data shed little light on the real issues. <sssss> Maybe I knew too much going in. <sssss> Maybe I expected too much from a few positive references from other sources. <sssss> In the middle I was confused. <sssss> By the end I was simply disappointed. <sssss> And I have my own number, and it changes every day

Elizabeth C. Hoberg "ehoberge"		The Sound and the Fury: The Corrected Text with Faulkner's Appendix (Modern Library): Books: William Faulkner		2		While some may think that good work should be "readable and enjoyable," great work is meant to elevate us. <sssss> Stun us, amaze us, fill us with wonder. <sssss> Otherwise, See Spot Run would be a masterpiece. <sssss> William Faulkner is a writer the likes of which we may never see again. <sssss> He is not only brilliant of word but of concept. <sssss> He creates a picture not only by text, but by context and form. <sssss> In many ways, his works sculpt. <sssss> How else would we see things from the vistas of the characters, especially those who can't speak but by setting and demonstration? <sssss> One reviewer cursed his conveyance of emotion by "using big words." <sssss> Writing is the art of language interplay, the use of beautiful and succinct language. <sssss> Faulkner uses language that most of us have never heard of but when we take the time to look up that language, the effect is stunning and makes the experience all the more worth it.

John W. Pigott "jpig98"		The Number : A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life: Books: Lee Eisenberg		1		This is, without question, the WORST book ever written on one's financial life. <sssss> To begin with, it's useless: ZERO information, ZERO new analysis of old information, ZERO advice, ZERO interesting anecdotes. <sssss> Additionally, it's rambling--meandering from summaries of old data, to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel-good blathering. <sssss> What exactly is this guy's point? <sssss> No way to tell. <sssss> Seriously, this book is SO BAD that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have, in my opinion, lost all remaining credibility. <sssss> What a waste of my $16 and 4 hours. <sssss> I want my money and time back.

Lin "childrens' book addict from downunder"		The Five Chinese Brothers (Paperstar): Books: Claire Huchet Bishop,Kurt Wiese		1		Racism is not the problem with this book - sure...5 Chinese brothers look alike -maybe they look alike because they are brothers, not because they are Chinese. <sssss> I bought this book because generally I love the books written in earlier times - they have a quaintness about their stories and illustrations that can transport you and your child to another time. <sssss> This book does have engaging illustrations. <sssss> What I find disturbing is the fact that this is a book for children yet: (1)	a little boy drowns, never to be seen again (2)	one brother is tried, arrested and sentenced to have his head cut off (3)	the people of the village assemble in the village to witness the execution where the "executioner took his sword and struck a mighty blow" (4)	the next brother was sentenced to be drowned and was thrown overboard from a boat (5)	the next brother is sentenced to be burned alive - he was tied up to a stake and set fire (6)	the next brother is sentenced to be suffocated - he's shovelled into an oven This is no more appropriate for a child (or adult for that matter) in 1936 than it is in 2005. <sssss> Now, a lot of you are probably thinking I'm one of those mothers who just needs to get a sense of humour and lighten up. <sssss> I'm not...I love the Giving Tree, and can put naughty Eloise (and the smoking nanny) in context, as I can many other books that polarise readers. <sssss> I really wanted to like this book but trust me....if you buy it, you will have lots of uncomfortable explaining to do to a young child. <sssss> An eight year old may be able to put it in context, but there is no way you should read this to a four year old. <sssss> If you want a great book written in the 1930s, buy Ferdinand the Bull instead. <sssss> It's a fantastic book.

Mark E. Hugie "Testaverde76"		The chamber: Books: John Grisham		1		I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things. <sssss> Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed. <sssss> The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber. <sssss> The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story." <sssss> Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending. <sssss> I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it. <sssss> Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author. <sssss> Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them
Robert M. Languedoc		Design by Contract by Example: Books: Richard Mitchell,Jim McKim		2		As the authors state in the preface of the book, the main focus of the text is to show the reader how to write high quality contracts. <sssss> This is not a text intended to convince readers of the veracity of design by contract, but if you are a developer with an academic knowledge of assertions, then this book with its extensive examples will likely convert you to a design by contract advocate. <sssss> Most of the examples presented in the book are written in Eiffel, an object oriented language that fully supports preconditions, postconditions and invariants without need for preprocessing. <sssss> If you haven't written code in Eiffel I highly recommend that you download EiffelStudio and deploy the examples in this book. <sssss> Although there are tools that offer assertion facilities, none provide the ease of use as that seen in the Eiffel language. <sssss> The text covers a preprocessor that imparts assertions to Java, but the extra steps and unique keywords required to incorporate and activate the assertions are likely to prevent wide scale use of the tool in a software development environment. <sssss> Some aspects of object oriented languages such as design by contract and multiple inheritance are often taught through a language and an integrated developer's environment that minimally supports the functionality. <sssss> As such developers form a poor opinion of the concept and not the tool. <sssss> The keyword support of contracts in Eiffel makes the language a perfect learning tool which will impart a more than academic understanding of the value of assertions. <sssss> The authors state ardently that developers have a choice between spending hours hunting down the causes of runtime errors or instead allocating time to write thorough contracts. <sssss> As a sometimes Eiffel developer I can state that this assertion is accurate. <sssss> Since contracts also assign responsibility for the runtime errors, they are invaluable for debugging. <sssss> I recall an instance when I encountered a postcondition violation while using a linked list from the Eiffel library. <sssss> As a client of the class, I didn't spend any time tracking down the source of the error other than to report it along with the condition that triggered the error to the supplier. <sssss> In industry significant time is spent debugging code prior to delivery and maintaining code afterwards. <sssss> Any concept or tool that aids in this function is indispensable to the project. <sssss> Apparently many people understood this notion since for several years the proposal to broaden Java to include keyword support of programming by contract was purportedly the most frequent "non-bug" report requested by Java developers. <sssss> The book is well organized providing a set of step by step instructions on how to write robust contracts applicable to a wide range of examples from simple data structures to more advanced cases such as the implementation of the Observer Pattern. <sssss> I considered myself well versed in design by contract but the six principles and guidelines as well as the frame rules, introduced successively via examples, provided a more rigorous approach to developing contracts than I had employed in the past. <sssss> In Chapter 2, the distinction between basic and derived queries is discussed and all six principles are introduced through a stack example. <sssss> Each principle is unveiled in conjunction with designing methods and their contracts for the data structure. <sssss> In the development of the dictionary class in Chapter 3, the authors present a case for a new query which asks if the dictionary already contains a specific key. <sssss> The query arises from the specific application of the principles pertaining to postconditions. <sssss> This is an excellent example of how contracts result in the development of new and needed features in a class. <sssss> In Chapter 6, the authors present a clear rational for weakening inherited preconditions and strengthening postconditions and invariants in accordance with other literature pertaining to the same topic. <sssss> In particular, the example of a delivery service reads like a case of retail agreement in plain language but is complemented by examples of code and UML diagrams. <sssss> The concept of guarding postconditions with preconditions to facilitate possible redefinition of methods is also introduced and well explained. <sssss> Chapter 8 covers the benefits of design by contract and if the reader has compiled and executed the examples presented in the book, they will have experienced some of these benefits firsthand. <sssss> Of course there are considerations like better documentation and more reliable code, but the debugging assistance is the most overt benefit of contracts. <sssss> The stack traces associated with assertion exceptions are an invaluable tool during both development and maintenance. <sssss> Anyone who has developed quality software under a tight schedule understands the benefits of precision bug identification and resolution. <sssss> Analysis by contract, introduced in the final chapter, presents the concepts of design by contract abstractly removed from the code specifics. <sssss> The authors present an analysis of a person withdrawing money from a bank. <sssss> In doing so they codify the sequence of events based on the contract stating that the design is "derived from the specification rather than being a design that is also being used as a specification." <sssss> The obvious implication of this is that the final product will likely fulfill the specification implicitly. <sssss> This is a book packed with knowledge that is essential for all developers regardless of the current support of design by contract in conventional languages. <sssss> In the future, as the more popular languages incorporate additional design by contract concepts, there will be an increased number of authors producing texts on these topics as well as a growing number of developers annotating their resumes accordingly. <sssss> I suspect that all of these texts will reference Design by Contract by Example and many of the developers that already understand the concept will be well acquainted with the pages of this book.

Thomas Stamper		If You Survive: From Normandy to the Battle of the Bulge to the End of World War II, One American Officer's Riveting True Story: Books: George Wilson		2		Wilson doesn't spend two paragraphs explaining how the snow clung to the trees. <sssss> He tells you about how the bombs sounded as they landed near him and how he saw his friends get cut down in the prime of life. <sssss> You get a pretty good feeling for what it must have been like to dig a foxhole and wait for the mortar fire. <sssss> It's scary the way he relates having come upon on a bunch of lost Germans who could have killed him had he paused a few seconds. <sssss> When he describes the onset of winter and his men without the proper protective gear losing digits to frostbite, you can just imagine some bureaucrat sitting by a toasty fire promising to get on that tomorrow. <sssss> It's amazing that Wilson could write such a detailed history forty years after the events occurred, but maybe even more amazing that he doesn't embellish the situations. <sssss> There is little reflection on an event because he's off describing the next firefight or lost buddy. <sssss> The most frustrating parts of the book were seeing raw officers replacing fallen soldiers rather than promoting the battle proven officers in the field. <sssss> It was not only unfair, but unsafe and yet the bigwigs away from the fighting didn't know the difference. <sssss> The title refers to a commander who told Wilson before he went into battle that he'd be promoted if he survived. <sssss> The promotions were slower coming than his successes and yet the war is such a long way away from this retired insurance salesman that he doesn't seem that upset about his treatment. <sssss> It turned out to be the experience of his life.
		Promising community drug abuse prevention programs: Testimony (Testimony): Books: Robert York		1		I was interested in the plot and characters for about half the book. <sssss> After that it seemed that little new information was added, or the little that was new came in the midst of much repetition. <sssss> There were so many different characters, and we had to hear the separate reactions of each of them to bits of news. <sssss> The structure of the tale reminded me of the way a police procedural might be played out on TV
A Reader		Digital Communications: Books: John G. Proakis		1		John R. Barry (another Digital Communications textbook author) first introduced me to this text. <sssss> And Mr. Barry, as with many com. <sssss> theory persons I've met since (GTRI in Atlanta, GA; MITRE along around the Boston area of MA; Northrup in El Segundo, CA; Intersil in Palm Bay/Melbourne, FL) actually use this book to justify their values and beliefs. <sssss> Essentially, it's their Bible. <sssss> The only problem is that the values and beliefs in Proakis, especially from an engineering perspective, are very third rate. <sssss> Trying to use this text in a classroom situation, especially with a third rate engineer as an instructor, is an utter disaster from both an economic and an engineering perspective. <sssss> John R. Barry, for example, is a very good baby-sitter and a so-so mathematician (he couldn't be otherwise as a faculty member of Georgia Tech). <sssss> But as an engineer, John R. Barry, as with the other followers of Proakis, compares very unfavorably (in fact, I don't consider Barry an engineer; I consider him a phony that should be removed from the ECE faculty of GATECH; the department's economic fortunes would be far better if he were moved into some kind of adjunct English/Mathematics Faculty or just shipped off to some research laboratory without any students to harm [i.e., vampirically mind f--k them and then kindly provide them with werewolfic deliverance (yes, I mean along the lines of the 1972 movie with Jon Voight [Angelina Jolie's Dad] and Burt Reynolds)]...any place where truth/reality aren't so important). <sssss> There are far, far better communications engineers out there than John R. Barry [infinitely better to be precise]. <sssss> And what makes these others better [others meaning real engineers; John R. Barry being a make-believe "engineer"] is not mathematical ability, memorized knowledge, or even rhetorical shrewdness, but rather the difference lies in a faith of facts; something a follower of Proakis never seems to possess or even grasp the possibility. <sssss> In fact, the values and beliefs in the Proakis text seem to promulgate not only Intellectual Abuse, but also a Spiritual sort as well. <sssss> In a nation (where Steven Pinker, who like Proakis is of Harvard Fame, has noted) that has around 75% of its population esentially believing in the biblical/torah-related account of things, this kind of Spiritual abuse can be very dangerous indeed and lead to serious consequences. <sssss> Though it may not be intentional, nevertheless, the values and beliefs of Proakis's text and those of its instructors tend to be extremely spiritually abusive. <sssss> These values and these beliefs somehow set up a massive cognative dissonance with many student's own biblical/torah-related values and beliefs. <sssss> The result is almost always a broken-spirit. <sssss> From an economic perspective, this is bad. <sssss> Very bad. <sssss> And it should be stopped by no longer using this text or any like it. <sssss> Most of the "engineers" now being "developed" by the followers of Proakis (e.g., John R. Barry) are very analogous to Mid 20th Century Carribean medical school "doctors." <sssss> They can say, write, and use a lot of terminology making them useful for billing purposes, i.e. <sssss> writing up invoices to Insurance/Government agencies. <sssss> These "engineers" like those "doctors" don't and probably never will understand the essence of their professions, though because of their training or lack thereof they really think they do. <sssss> When in fact, they are utterly clueless "professionals.
Chatelaine "hiddenartist"		Lords of the Earth: Books: Don Richardson		2		"Lords of the Earth" is the term the Yali warriors use to describe themselves. <sssss> They live in the Heluk valley in Irian Jaya, and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains. <sssss> The first section of the book is about them, their customs, and the awful fear and darkness they lived in. <sssss> Don Richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin, and longing for release. <sssss> The horror of their pain is graphic, and not suitable to be read to younger children. <sssss> The second part of the book describes the early life of Stan Dale, his conversion, and his burden for those in darkness. <sssss> He is drawn as a determined man, physically strong and fit, with firm convictions. <sssss> The book goes on to tell of Stan's coming to the Yali people. <sssss> How a strange story begins over his identity, protecting his life. <sssss> How the first few Yali Christians were killed, and later Stan and a fellow missionary were brutally murdered. <sssss> How another missionary family died in a plane crash, except for the nine-year-old son, whose friendship with the Yali paves the way for them to turn to Christ. <sssss> The book reminded me Christ's words in John 12:24, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." <sssss> On earth, Stan Dale never saw the fruit his life and death brought forth, but he will rejoice in heaven with the Yali that are there through his witness.
Shane Key		The Next Great Bubble Boom: How to Profit from the Greatest Boom in History: 2006-2010: Books: Harry S. Dent		2		The boom Mr. Dent speaks of HAS begun-but is starting in the population centers of the Far East and is being partially digitally controlled by companies here in America. <sssss> The boom will hit us in industries that we have competitive advantage in and will then expand into the financial sector once enough excess labor is absorbed in the competitive advantage industries that wages go up as companies compete for workers. <sssss> Since so many of our publicly-traded companies outsource and have significant overseas manufacturing operations, they are using that cost-savings in order to finance the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley. <sssss> The net effect is that Sarbanes-Oxley is being digitally enforced throughout the global operations of U.S. publicly-traded companies. <sssss> This is part of the reason why you hear of increasing unrest in many emerging markets. <sssss> Large portions of their economies are being reshuffled in order to digitally align with our securities laws. <sssss> So the industries that will expand will primarily focus around: 1. <sssss> Baby Boomer spending 2. <sssss> Competitive advantage exports
Cookbook Gal "Cookbook Gal"		Classic Home Desserts: A Treasury of Heirloom and Contemporary Recipes from Around the World: Books: Richard Sax		2		This book is comprehensive and easy to follow. <sssss> Every recipe I have tried has worked. <sssss> The pecan pie recipe is especially good, and very easy for novice bakers. <sssss> If you could have only one dessert book on your shelf, this would be it
BeatrixB		Paris to the Moon: Books: Adam Gopnik		1		If you're going to write about the city that is Paris, you'd better be up to the task. <sssss> Gopnik may have the writing and observation skills that would have served this assignment well, but this collection of essays generally falls flat. <sssss> For someone who resided in the City of Light for 5 whole years, Gopnik gives us a surprisingly myopic picture constrained by his own self-absorption. <sssss> Those who are interested in Paris and its natives will be sorely disappointed in the smug chronicles of a New Yorker who regards himself and his son to be the most interesting elements of this city. <sssss> I have zero interest in My-Toddler-Does-Paris stories and Gopnik's relentless insertion of his look-how-cute-my-kid-is accounts should have been saved for a family re-union instead of wasting precious space that could have been used for more interesting topics. <sssss> For a better book on Paris cuisine and culture, check out the collection of Gourmet essays from the last 60 years titled 'Remembrance of Things Paris'. <sssss> It provides a wider variety of perspectives and a more expansive and interesting view of Paris -- and it's blessedly free of all that baby's-scrapbook stuff.
D. Galle "Duane Galle"		IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic Alliance between Nazi Germany and America's Most Powerful Corporation: Books: Edwin Black		1		While this is a well researched and thought-provoking piece of literature, I do have some critical comments to make. <sssss> Firstly, it is apparent that the author's own holocaust experiences (or more specifically, those of his family) have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented. <sssss> Secondly, there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get, in my opinion, a few pieces of interesting material. <sssss> Finally, the underlying theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened, or would not have been so sever, is (again in my opinion) flawed. <sssss> As the book shows, IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews, it would not have been impossible without IBM. <sssss> Having said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading
George		Hello to All That: A Memoir of War, Zoloft, and Peace: Books: John Falk		2		John Falk takes the reader on the journey of his escape from depression. <sssss> And while medicine plays a key part in his freedom, we also see how a brutal and bloody war also plays a role. <sssss> His description of his illness is juxtaposed nicely against teh atrocities of war and his insights into himself and the war are poingant. <sssss> A good read
David R. Bess		Advanced Strategic Planning,: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders: Books: Aubrey Malphurs		2		I've read some of the negative reviews listed for this title, and I must strongly disagree. <sssss> Malphurs' work here is the best treatment of strategic planning for churches I have found to date. <sssss> In place of the term "advanced" in the title, a better word would be "comprehensive." <sssss> Nonetheless, Malphurs here provides a handbook addressing church planning that is unrivaled today in breadth and insight. <sssss> As a pastor of twenty years, I wish this book had been available when I first started in ministry. <sssss> I hope this title is now offered in many seminaries, because its content would be a gold mine for young, soon-to-be church leaders. <sssss> Pastors, church staff members, and lay leaders, this volume is a must-have. <sssss> In my opinion, it is required reading for anyone involved in church leadership
Karyn N=d		I'm Chocolate, You're Vanilla: Raising Healthy Black and Biracial Children in a Race-Conscious World: Books: Marguerite Wright		1		I didn't care for this book at all. <sssss> I think it is a very well written book, for TEACHERS, but not for a parent who is transracially adopting a child. <sssss> I was looking for a book on how I would parent an African American child and this book was more of a textbook. <sssss> I think it is very misleading to have it labeled as a "must read for parents and teachers" and it should be advertised as a book for teachers. <sssss> I thought "Inside Their Voices" was much more informative about the experiences of a transracially adopted child
Mark		You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times: Books: Howard Zinn		2		What lessons, if any, do past social movements teach American citizens? <sssss> Is change feasible in today's society? <sssss> Howard Zinn attempts to answer these two questions, along with a number of others, in his book entitled 'You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times.' <sssss> A beautifully written and inspirational book, 'You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train' is quintessential Zinn-direct, yet optimistic. <sssss> Zinn's central argument is that we are all capable of participating in change, however, for change to occur, we must all experience a social and political reawakening. <sssss> Zinn's book offers the reader a more hopeful version of politics and society. <sssss> Yet, such a version is only feasible if we, as Americans, actively participate in the political process. <sssss> This involvement will fill ones soul with a sense of meaning, and in the end will create a better world for all to live in. <sssss> For those interested in the history of American society, politics, and social justice issues, 'You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train' is a marvelous book filled with inspiration
A being from Planet Earth		The Night Listener: A Spoken Word Serial: Books: Armistead Maupin,Maupin Armistead		2		I LOVED this book! <sssss> I read it in a single day. <sssss> I have read everything else of Maupin's and strongly recommend this novel, too. <sssss> This is probably my favorite book of his. <sssss> The author had more lyrical descriptions in this book than I remember from his past volumes. <sssss> I found myself rereading lines and paragraphs simply for the sheer beauty of language. <sssss> The falling apart relationship between Gabriel and Jess also hit me as realistic and at times almost too painful to read. <sssss> A great book!! <sssss> !
Dh Heun		The Holographic Universe: Books: Michael Talbot		1		...and dump it...great advice given in a previous review. <sssss> I think the "shame" about this book is that it glosses over some very interesting ideas with (in my opinion) some wholly unsupported and mostly un-related crap. <sssss> Talbot is to the theory of the Holographic Universe what Mark Furman was to the guilt of OJ Simpson. <sssss> Whatever truth there is to it will be hidden by his presentation of "false evidence"
Ron Mccafferty		Learning Python, Second Edition: Books: Mark Lutz,David Ascher		2		You can always depend on the O'Reilly "Learning" series to provide an excellent detailed introduction to any language. <sssss> You will be up and running after you read this book. <sssss> My only complaint is the same material was covered several times as it was expanded in detail.
Wafa Rashed		Healing from the Heart: A Leading Surgeon Combines Eastern and Western Traditions to Create the Medicine of the Future: Books: Mehmet Oz M.D.,Mehmet Oz,Dean Ornish		2		Dr. Oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation. <sssss> He describes how he combines complementary medicine (e.g. <sssss> hypnosis, reflexology, yoga, message, acupuncture. <sssss> Etc) with orthodox Western medicine. <sssss> There is an excellent forward by Dr Dean Ornish, and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques. <sssss> The bulk of the book contains stories of patients Dr. Oz treated using this revolutionary way. <sssss> I am a cardiologist, and I have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine, which is the reason I bought this book. <sssss> However this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment. <sssss> Nevertheless, those interested in this new medicine, which I think will be the medicine of the new millennium, will want to read this book
Tim Peters		Our Posthuman Future: Books: Francis Fukuyama		1		By arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of "dignity" and "familiarity" rather than sentience and feeling, Fukuyama brings to mind the European colonists who considered Africans no more than "common beasts." <sssss> His philosophy, although argued in a tone that seems reasonable, is at turns startingly narrow-minded and genetically-racist. <sssss> Not reccomended: readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics
Joshua Koppel		Mathematical Origami: Geometrical Shapes by Paper Folding: Books: David Mitchell		2		Although not as fascinating as his PAPER CRYSTALS (a stellar work of modular origami), MATHEMATICAL ORIGAMI is a very solid work on the topic. <sssss> David Mitchell again gives clear instructions in text and diagrams for a very intriguing branch of paperfolding. <sssss> There are many books on geometric and modular origami, but Mitchell's are more than just "look at this neat design." <sssss> Instead, they are well thought out and very intelligently written. <sssss> A must-have for fans of the art
Joe "Joe"		Conspirator's Hierarchy : The Committee of 300: Books: John Coleman		1		The subtitle to this review should have been "Glaring Inconsistencies pppppppppp Outright Fantasies". <sssss> I've found a large number of inconsistencies with history that should be obvious to anyone who has read this thing closely. <sssss> For example, on page 7 Coleman says "the Club of Rome was established in 1968", but on page 17 he suggests that the Club of Rome played "a key role in the Cuban Missile Crisis" and "attempted to sell its 'crisis management'...progam to President Kennedy." <sssss> Unless we've been misled, the Cuban Missile Crisis happened a full 6 years before this group was founded. <sssss> What are careful readers to make of such a passage? <sssss> Either it's a typo and he means 1958, or, as I heartily suspect, he doesn't have a grasp on his subject. <sssss> On page 9 Coleman suggests Henry "Kissinger's role in destabilizing the United States by three wars, the Middle East, Korea, and Vietnam is well known..." However, Kissinger, working at Harvard from 1948, had no role in the U.S. government until the 1960's, working for the Kennedy Administration. <sssss> The Korean War, as we are all aware, occured in 1950, and ended long before Kissinger had any influence on American foreign policy. <sssss> If it were true that Kissinger had an influence on the United States' policy in Korea, for example, then Coleman would be wise to address that issue at this point in his text. <sssss> However, he only leaves us with the cryptic "is well known". <sssss> It is definitely NOT well known, and Coleman is just fooling those readers who think that a book which is difficult to read or which is discussing difficult subjects must be true. <sssss> These are just a few of the inconsistencies that I could check in a short time that Coleman throws out at you. <sssss> If you're not a careful reader, you'll be tricked into accepting some really ridiculous ideas. <sssss> If you prefer speculation to reason, then by all means gorge yourself in the sickly sweet nectar of "what ifs". <sssss> If you're looking for something based on reality, then, rider, pass by
Lillith "victoriousprettyflower"		Pedophiles and Priests: Anatomy of a Contemporary Crisis: Books: Philip Jenkins		1		Personally I found this book to be little more than a GRE verbal refresher course. <sssss> Sure, it is objective and balanced but so impassionate that such a contentious issue seems like nothing. <sssss> I think you can strip away emotion from a social problem so much that it creates the question of, well, then, does this really matter? <sssss> In my opinion I feel this is what the author has done. <sssss> I was really disappointed in this book
Michael Le Houllier		King of Torts: Books: John Grisham		2		Here is the disclaimer: I was already a proponent of tort reform before I read this book. <sssss> However, after reading this novel, I am a stronger proponent of it than ever. <sssss> Enter Clay Carter - unknown defender in D.C. of the poorest of the poor. <sssss> Then a nice juicy settlement falls into his lap, one he can't refuse, partly because the parent's of his long-time girlfriend are pressuring him regarding his money. <sssss> Give Carter a taste of money, then the greed sets in. <sssss> For the middle half of the book, we get to see unadulterated greed come to run his life! <sssss> Especially infuriating is how he lets that greed come before the well-being of his clients. <sssss> This is what will be his undoing. <sssss> One of his clients who was already ticked off at a settlement he made gets a terminal illness and decides to go after his lawyer. <sssss> This is the rags to riches to almost rags in the course of about eighteen months. <sssss> Grisham actually makes you feel sympathetic with the main charater (Clay Carter) through his rise, and especially his fall. <sssss> That shows to the quality of his storytelling. <sssss> In fact, while Carter is in some ways a sympathetic character, he mostly is not! <sssss> Mass torts and greed is the theme of this story. <sssss> The fact that he came back to haunt him was only justice. <sssss> Too bad such justice doesn't often happen in the real world of mass torts
dqc "dqc"		Investments + S pppppppppp P Card + Powerweb + StockTrak discount coupon: Books: Zvi Bodie,Alex Kane,Alan J. Marcus		1		i am currently subjecting myself to finance curriculum at a quant-heavy, top-5 bschool. <sssss> this text was recommended for my Intro Cap Markets class (although the prof didnt exactly use it in the class). <sssss> i often used it to gain understanding of what was taught in class. <sssss> unfortunately, i found this book to be EXTREMELY painful. <sssss> it was verbose, overly complicated, hard to read, poorly organized pppppppppp full of jargon. <sssss> while it is thorough in its coverage of Capital Markets pppppppppp instruments, i found it to be nearly impossible to read. <sssss> esoteric theories pppppppppp mathematical proofs were introduced with little background, and often without insufficient detail to understand grasp. <sssss> but the jargon pppppppppp vocabulary are what made the book so unreadable ... trying to read a chapter in this book would literally consume 4-5 hours of my time. <sssss> AND forget about trying to use this book to do problemsets OR assignments. <sssss> i could go on, but trust me, this book is bad ... <sssss> UNLESS you already have a good intro pppppppppp just want to use this as a reference
Thomas Torrillo		The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster: Books: Bobby Henderson		1		I had read all about FSM before picking up this book and bought it as more of a conversation piece. <sssss> Well, suffice to say this will never get any space with my other books as it is very poorly put together. <sssss> Flimsy cover, flimsy pages, it's put together about as well as a children's coloring book. <sssss> I too was fooled by the default picture, I thought it was a nice hard cover with a bookmark ribbon like other "religious" texts. <sssss> Nothing could be further from the truth. <sssss> Hey Amazon, change the default picture to the one which shows the book as is, a flimsy cover with a picture of a hard cover on it
Britt Udy "Mom at long last"		Open Adoption Experience: Complete Guide for Adoptive and Birth Families - From Making the Decision Throug: Books: Lois Ruskai Melina		2		I can't say enough about this wonderful book. <sssss> It's packed full of examples, covers more than just the pre-adoption and placement aspects, and is incredibly non-judgemental. <sssss> There's so much information here, more than I expected. <sssss> It really helped me think through all of the issues related to adoption. <sssss> It's for both birth and adoptive parents, in fact, two of the birth parents we've been in contact with were excited to hear about it and ended up ordering the book themselves. <sssss> Reading through this book really helped me conquer my fears about adoption. <sssss> I'm so glad it was recommended to us. <sssss> If you're thinking about adoption, even if you're thinking that open adoption isn't right for you I highly recommend taking a chance and buying this book. <sssss> It's great
Christy Steinke "Colorado Brit"		Cooking with the 14 Super Foods: Books: Cq Products		1		I was excited to see the book with recipes for the "14 Super Foods" after reading Steven Pratt's book, but was very disappointed. <sssss> Yes, the recipes do use the "14 Super Foods", but also use such ingredients as shortening, Cheez Whiz, and yellow cake mix - hardly healthy! <sssss> If you are interested in eating good, healthy meals made with the "14 Super Foods", don't buy this book
A. Sergenese		How Big Is a Foot?: Books: Rolf Myller		2		This is a terrific book for young and older children. <sssss> It is a fun way to demonstrate why we need a universal form of measurement.
M. Stricks		Born to Kvetch: Yiddish Language and Culture in All Its Moods: Books: Michael Wex		2		Born to Kvetch is, at one time, informative, enlightening, synical, humorous, and irreligious. <sssss> I learned so much about the Yiddish language, Jewish mores and their beginnings, Jewish and Yiddish history and interpersonal relations. <sssss> At times I was in tears of laughter or a tear of sadness; amazed or embarrassed and often shocked by Michael Wex's irreverence. <sssss> Loved it all
Andrey Lenskiy		Neverwinter Nights 2 World Editor: Books: BradyGames		1		I was disappointed greatly at the time I opened this book. <sssss> HUGE gaps between strings, LOTS of empty space on pages - all this is for masking the simple fact: this "200 pages book" contents could be easily printed on 80 pages or even less. <sssss> And, more, these pages are filled with useless "interviews" (who wants to read an interview INSTEAD of explanations?!) <sssss> and other empty words. <sssss> The book is supposed to teach us how to make modules for NWN 2. <sssss> But it doesn't. <sssss> See, the chapter about scripts consists of 4 pages - is it REALLY enough for such a great theme? <sssss> (These pages, I mentioned it already, are less than 2 pages...). <sssss> This book is better than nothing. <sssss> A bit. <sssss> Because SOME useful information it provides. <sssss> And that's all good that could be said about it
Concerned Small Church Leader		Natural Church Development: A Guide to Eight Essential Qualities of Healthy Churches: Books: Christian A. Schwarz		1		This guide to church growth has gained popularity during the recent trend of mega-church models and numerical prowess in evaluating the current health and future viability of individual churches. <sssss> Many of the theories and models are based on business studies and business growth theories. <sssss> While the guide may be helpful in identifying strengths and weaknesses in your local congregation, its theories for projecting future growth or your church's demise are analyzed using European and Urban models, and have limited insight into the unique dynamics of the Christian church in the varied regions of North America as a whole. <sssss> Most limiting in this perspective is the distinctly spiritual aspect of church growth which results in a gigantic disparity in trying to compare churches and businesses. <sssss> This is a manual for analyzing and strategizing, for plotting and planning to stock more "seats in the pews," and makes no significant mention of the actual spiritual journey or genuine troubles and struggles of the very real person searching for belief. <sssss> The philosophies of this book graphically illustrates why some other Christian writers such as Eugene Peterson, contend that too many pastors view the members of their churches as assets to be managed rather than human souls with questions, concerns, needs and priorities of their own. <sssss> Issues that cannot be forgotten in the numbers game of current church growth modalities
Roselande		Communication in Our Lives (with CD-ROM and Speech Builder Express/InfoTrac) (Wadsworth Series in Speech Communication): Books: Julia T. Wood		1		I received a book that I didn't even order. <sssss> The one I ordered is yellow and white ( 3th edition). <sssss> THis isn't the one I ordered; therefore, I need a refund.I sent the book back and I know the seller received it on 8/19
P. Burdick "pataburd2"		Truly Our Sister: A Theology of Mary in the Communion of Saints: Books: Elizabeth A. Johnson		1		I concur with another reviewer: get Luigi Gambero's "Mary and the Fathers of the Church," and, I might add, his follow-up work, "Mary in the Middle Ages." <sssss> Read these two books alongside "Truly Our Sister. <sssss> . <sssss> .," then decide whether 15 or 16 centuries of organic, historically contiguous development of the Church's Marian doctrine by some of the finest minds and hearts the Church has ever produced--including Bridget of Sweden, or Johnson's glib, 21st century, feminist revisionism provides the better spiritual nourishment. <sssss> The Blessed Virgin Mary stirs us to properly love her divine Son, bringing us into the intimate recesses of the Trinitarian love itself! <sssss> Anything shy of that simply misses the point and leaves one painfully short-changed.
Mike Reilly		The Glorious Cause: Books: Jeff Shaara		1		"The Glorious Cause" is the sequel to "Rise to Rebellion," and since the first novel was so good I eagerly dove into this one, but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization. <sssss> On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4, as compared to the 8 I would give "Rise to Rebellion." <sssss> The events recounted in "Rise to Rebellion" involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much more detailed and interesting, with a vast array of characters that were so colorful; John Adams, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and others. <sssss> "The Glorious Cause" was not without its merits, but it seemed so much drier and less appealing, with a more narrow focus. <sssss> It was far too long in some parts, to the point my attention wandered, and getting through it was a chore in some sections, unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages. <sssss> I listened to this book on audio tape during my commute, and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene. <sssss> One element I felt truly slighted by was the coverage of Benedict Arnold and his defection to the British cause. <sssss> I assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book, but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material. <sssss> A mark of a good book is how I feel when I have finished reading it - if I am disappointed I have reached the end of the story, then I know it was time well spent. <sssss> Getting to the end of "The Glorious Cause" felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project; it was uncomfortable work, and now that I'm done I feel I can do something a bit more interesting. <sssss> Because Shaara did such a good job with "Rise to Rebellion" I don't feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility; perhaps the subject matter didn't complement my taste as well. <sssss> I prefer interesting historial detail over tepid, droning battle descriptions, and I feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between "Rise to Rebellion" and "The Glorious Cause.
Chris		John Lennon in His Own Write: Books: John Lennon		2		An absolutely magnificent peice of literature! <sssss> The use of language is witty and funny and I have never experienced such joy from a collection of short stories before. <sssss> The ''Is He Deep?'' <sssss> introduction set the mood of the bok and that question played on mind throughout the entire read. <sssss> Fantasti
Will Robertson "Will"		Clay's Way: A Novel: Books: Blair Mastbaum		2		This book does something I've never seen before. <sssss> It shows a cool young homo boy who's punk rock and a skater, not some wishwashy queen-boy. <sssss> Sam, the lead character, is really cool. <sssss> I'd like to be his friend, and his boyfriend, but that's another matter. <sssss> Also, the dude he likes, Clay, is really hot. <sssss> He's a surfer, but he's not a stereotypical surfer, he's much cooler, and also a little punk rock. <sssss> I love this novel. <sssss> The ending is really sad, but I loved it
Anonymous Reader		A Bend in the Road: Books: Nicholas Sparks		1		I read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen. <sssss> As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story. <sssss> It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing. <sssss> The story's decent. <sssss> The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go? <sssss> Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe? <sssss> It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one. <sssss> A decent book to read, but don't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work
Neil Bacon "Patriot"		Understanding Iraq: The Whole Sweep of Iraqi History from Genghis Khan's Mongols to the Ottoman Turks to the British Mandate to the American Occupation: Books: William R. Polk		1		When Professor Polk describes the sweep of history in Iraq, he is at his best, but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts. <sssss> Much of the political ranting is supposition, marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work. <sssss> The ranting gets especially tedious towards the end. <sssss> My advice, read the first part and skip the last half
Diane DiResta "Diane DiResta, author of Knockout Presentations"		How to Persuade People Who Don't Want to be Persuaded: Get What You Want-Every Time!: Books: Joel Bauer,Mark Levy		2		I loved this book! <sssss> The authors share technqiues from carnival barkers, magicians, and tradeshow pros who know how to grab attention and captivate any audience. <sssss> While some books provide only principles, this book gives you step-by-step magic tricks, persuasion mechanisms and techniques that anyone can apply. <sssss> Written in a conversational tone, this entertaining book tells you the why and the how of persuasion. <sssss> Diane DiResta, author, Knockout Presentation
Julia Davies "Julia"		Lud-In-The-Mist: Books: Hope Mirrlees		2		This book was extremely well written. <sssss> It's a gorgeous story and not cliched at all. <sssss> What totally gets me is that after searching the web for a time, I have not been able to find anyone that has written on the connection between her book and the eugenics movement taking place in the 20's. <sssss> She most bluntly did not agree with eugenics at the end. <sssss> For example, on page 233, "And if all the gifts of Life are good, perhaps, too, are all the shapes she chooses to take, and which we cannot alter." <sssss> The book is filled with hints at the time period even though, after looking at countless reviews, the reviewers keep commenting on how her other books took from the time period and historical events and that Lud-in-the-Mist did not and it was a "fantastical" piece of literature. <sssss> In my opinion, this book was TOTALLY based on the time period. <sssss> There's even a line by the blacksmith about how since he's not "white" anymore he has come down in the world. <sssss> If you're looking for a cultural artifact of the 20's, this is an astounding piece
John P. Thiel "John T."		The Wide Window (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 3): Books: Lemony Snicket		2		This is an aweful story--you should read it, absolutely. <sssss> I dread the turn of every page, so I'm recommending it to my closest personal friends as well. <sssss> And since this is about terrible things happening to would-have-been-happy small children, I cannot in good conscience forget to recommend it to my brother so that he may read it to my nephews. <sssss> The most terrible story I've ever read--five stars
Aco		In the Moment: My Life as an Actor: Books: Ben Gazzara		1		This is not very good. <sssss> That is to say, the writing and the fluidity of Gazzara's life become bland and uninteresting quite fast. <sssss> I initially picked it up because as an actor I find biographies or autobio's about somewhat lesser known people more curious than approaching someone like Paul Newman or Brando, who each have several books...And Gazzara's career has been an intruiging one. <sssss> As a member of the Actors Studio, which produced the aforementioned actors along with countless others, his rise to Broadway and Hollywood was quick. <sssss> He originated Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and played his first film for Otto Preminger-opposite James Stewart and George C. Scott, among others-in Anatomy of a Murder. <sssss> But his approach to acting, which is of primary importance to me, was not chronicled. <sssss> Instead he regales with stories of what and who the people he worked with were like. <sssss> What the particular country he was shooting in was like, etc., etc. <sssss> One of his primary sources of regard is his work with John Cassavetes, and it is clear Cassavetes was a major influence and close friend, someone Gazzara owes much, and the process by which they created Husbands and other films is investigated more than any other. <sssss> Cassavetes too comes out as a more interesting, Larger Than Life guy, while Gazzara's tales of living in Italy, or being in Spain, New York, Hollywood, the Philippines, etc., etc. <sssss> just made me jealous... <sssss> I guess I wanted to know more about the life of an Actor who has worked as long as Gazzara has, is still relatively known-but never became a "star," and continues to work, without feeling he is a hack who doesn't take his work seriously..

Tom Sullivan		The Mystery of Life's Origin: Reassessing Current Theories: Books: Charles B. Thaxton		1		This book is an excellent example of how creationists approach science: write a book with a lot of bafflegab that sounds scientific but is actually devoid of any meaningful content, and then finish up by concluding that evolution is impossible. <sssss> What a bunch of baloney. <sssss> First of all, evolution, in the sense of "common descent," is not impossible. <sssss> Even ID-iot superstars Michael Behe, Stephen Meyer, and Jonathan Wells have admitted as much. <sssss> (See a summary of their recent testimony in the Kansas biology curriculum hearings in the evolution/creationism forum at the West Virginia Gazette. <sssss> (wvgazettemail) (put "/forums" after com) So any ID-iot who thinks all that bafflegab about irreducible complexity (IC) and the nonsense in this film is the death knell of evolution is simply ignorant. <sssss> Man evolved from non-human ancestors. <sssss> Get over it. <sssss> Thaxton in particular ought to read that summary, since he himself was one of the witnesses and looked particularly ID-iotic. <sssss> In any case, the empirical data discussed in this book is indeed nothing but bafflegab. <sssss> Talking about the allegedly empirical foundation for intelligent design makes it sound deliciously scientific, especially to poorly educated ID-iots, who generally are clueless about real science; but even if the empirical data is accurate, it's nothing but a facade, because it has nothing to do with the book's main conclusion. <sssss> For example, imagine your neighbor told you that his dog could play Beethoven concertos on the piano. <sssss> Skeptical, you ask for proof. <sssss> "Simple," your neighbor replies. <sssss> "See, here's my dog, and there's my piano." <sssss> Only a moron would accept that as "proof," and yet ID-iot Christians are more than happy to accept exactly that kind of "proof" from ID-iotic films like this. <sssss> The problem with your neighbor's "proof" is that it proves only the existence of the dog and the existence of the piano. <sssss> Neither of those issues, however, was the real cause of your skepticism, so the "proof" was entirely meaningless. <sssss> The critical issue, of course, was not the mere existence of the dog and the piano, but rather the ability of the dog to play the piano, and your neighbor's "proof" was completely silent on that issue. <sssss> Again, only a moron would accept evidence of mere existence as proof of piano-playing ability. <sssss> In this book, there's a lot of talk about how complex certain biological systems are. <sssss> That is nothing but meaningless bafflegab, because the mere existence of complex systems is not a disputed issue. <sssss> The disputed issue is how those systems came into being, and on that issue the book's "evidence" is completely silent. <sssss> This book was designed to fool poorly educated, easily impressed ID-iots. <sssss> Judging from the five-star reviews, it seems to have succeeded. <sssss> Well, there's a sucker born every minute, and apparently a lot of them are found in evangelical churches and seminaries. <sssss> In one of the very first evolution debates, Thomas Huxley accused Bishop Wilberforce of using his intellectual and oratorical gifts to mislead and bamboozle people. <sssss> Things haven't changed much since then. <sssss> Instead of meaningful evidence, this book substitutes a God-of-the-gaps argument. <sssss> "Gee, look how complex it is. <sssss> It must have been created by an intelligent designer. <sssss> Maybe, just maybe, it was God. <sssss> Wink, wink." <sssss> God-of-the-gaps arguments are dumb. <sssss> Only ignorant suckers are taken in by them. <sssss> So if any of those folks who wrote five-star reviews for this book would like to buy a nice bridge in Brooklyn or a dog who can play Beethoven concertos on the piano, please give me a call. <sssss> I'll be happy to provide evidence!
Miss iNDy......Something New Book Club "Straight, No Chaser Reader"		Genevieve: Books: Eric Jerome Dickey		1		It took me a year to finally complete this book. <sssss> And honestly, the only reason I completed it was because I had nothing else on my bookshelf to read. <sssss> This book dragged on and on to the tiny climax about 5 pages from the end. <sssss> What a waste of such a beautiful book cover. <sssss> Do not waste a year of your life or a dime of your money
Douglas Gabbard		The Organized Executive: A Program for Productivity New Ways to Manage TimePaper People and the Electronic Office: Books: Stephanie Winston		1		The cover claims that the book has been "revised and updated for the digital age," but Winston's information on technological tools is both superficial and already dated. <sssss> The term, "PDA," does not even appear in the index
Jason Ard		The Left-Hander Syndrome : The Causes pppppppppp Consequences of Left Handedness: Books: Stanley Coren		1		This book is not what I thought I bought. <sssss> I was expecting information useful to left handers. <sssss> Instead I found out why society belives left-handers are evil and research on how left handers are formed. <sssss> I enjoyed reading the encylopedia more than this book. <sssss> By the way, it was written by a right-handed person

J. Rockafellow "busyjr"		American Pastoral: Books: Philip Roth,Ron Silver		1		American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. <sssss> I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good. <sssss> But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. <sssss> What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. <sssss> The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her
Margaret A. Mead		At Risk: Books: Patricia Daniels Cornwell		1		this was certainly not one of Cornwell's best works. <sssss> IT was almost like a couple of possible novels rolled into one. <sssss> It read like a draft for a novel rather tahn a complete novel
Jacki Kwan		The Healing Power of Humor: Books: Allen Klein		2		Since reading this book in 1994, I have used it as a reference for my life AND work. <sssss> Using a warm and witty style of writing, Allen teaches us the physiological and emotional benefits of mirth. <sssss> My favorite chapter title is pppppppppp quot;Strike While the Irony is Hot! <sssss> pppppppppp quot; So clever!! <sssss> I recommend this book to friends who are facing life challenges and to everyone who attends my workshops. <sssss> On a more personal note, since embracing The Healing Power of Humor, I felt freer to add a little levity to my Aunt Alice's funeral. <sssss> My family was amazingly grateful. <sssss> Me too
FaithfulReader.com		Five-Star Families: Moving Yours from Good to Great (Mothers of Preschoolers (Mops)): Books: Carol Kuykendall		2		Carol Kuykendall --- author, speaker, and strategic projects director for MOPS International (Mothers of Preschoolers) --- has compiled what she considers the five-star winning components of a successful family. <sssss> According to this mom of three grown children, the five key elements of a great family begin with love -- expressions that inspire and comfort; fun -- activities that recharge a family's batteries; loyalty -- lessons on sticking with family through it all; growth -- embracing new challenges and seeing the value of stretching; and faith -- holding close a relationship with Christ that shines vividly and practically into the lives of others. <sssss> With many personal anecdotes, fanciful stories, and good common sense advice, Kuykendall does a marvelous job presenting a handbook for parents that is easy on both the eyes and the heart. <sssss> The author's two-part text deals with family matters that focus on the beginnings of new family life when a young couple first discovers they're pregnant. <sssss> Some of the practical points offered in this section include deciding who to invite to the actual delivery, naming the baby by taking into account potential teasing/taunting as a result of this all-important choice, hashing out basic parenting decisions regarding naps/nursing/discipline, dealing with those unmet expectations that crop up almost immediately after giving birth, and learning to fit into the extended family with the newest member without stepping on other siblings' toes or feelings. <sssss> Kuykendall then delves into dreaming for a bit. <sssss> Just what kind of family does the new couple want to be? <sssss> The author discusses the value of looking back in order to glean the best of past childhoods while wisely leaving not-so healthy patterns behind where they belong. <sssss> She also details the importance of taking a realistic look at where a family is today, accepting where people are, because this is the point from which everyone can move ahead. <sssss> Finally, a brief segment on looking ahead with hopeful, faith-inspired enthusiasm closes out this foundational topic. <sssss> To complete part one, Kuykendall does a lovely job presenting the "gifts" children bring to a family. <sssss> Clearly, children are gifts from God, but with them come powerful life lessons on perspective. <sssss> Consider the gift of "do-overs," in which parents can relive the innocence and wonder of childhood discovery through their children's eyes. <sssss> This important truth reminds parents that God is the giver of second chances. <sssss> Kuykendall also cites the gifts of humility as children "reveal us to ourselves" as imperfect parents. <sssss> Children also model sincerity of a simple, uncomplicated faith. <sssss> Once this solid foundation is set, Kuykendall spends a generous amount of space re-defining her five-star qualities, each with its own separate chapter (Love, Fun, Loyalty, Growth, Faith). <sssss> Every chapter opens with a lengthy discussion that includes biblical principles and selected bible verses, personal insights from the author's own family life, specific action points, and quippy yet powerful quotations for increased take-away reminders. <sssss> One of the most telling quotations included in this timely text appears near the end, and it typifies Kuykendall's entire message beautifully. <sssss> "Family is...A soft place to land." <sssss> --- Reviewed by Michele How
lamaranthe		The Simple Truth (Thorndike Large Print Basic Series): Books: David Baldacci		1		The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many. <sssss> Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? <sssss> We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. <sssss> People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. <sssss> I have read much better books than that. <sssss> Sorry..
Carol Weston "bookclubmom"		The Teenage Guy's Survival Guide: The Real Deal on Girls, Growing Up and Other Guy Stuff: Books: Jeremy Daldry		2		What I like about this book is that the tone is just right for a self-conscious preteen boy who has more questions than answers but is too embarrassed to ask anybody. <sssss> Leave this book in his room or in the bathroom without making a big deal of it, and I bet he'll take a look inside. <sssss> Some books are so clinical; others don't provide enough information. <sssss> This one gets it right--at least for your basic seventh or eighth grader. <sssss> As someone who has been writing for girls for years, I'm always curious about what is out there for boys, and I like Daldry's style. <sssss> Carol Weston, author of Girltalk: All the Stuff Your Sister Never Told You
S. Quevedo "szoer"		The Accidental Tourist (G.K. Hall Large Print Book Series): Books: Anne Tyler		2		I actually enjoyed this book very much. <sssss> I was in a romance slump and needed something different. <sssss> Well, I got it. <sssss> There is no need to give a synopsis of the story -- my predecessors have done an excellent job. <sssss> The only thing I really want to say is that I really, really liked Muriel and Edward, the dog.
givbatam3 "givbatam3"		The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire, 1936-1945 (Modern Library War): Books: John Toland		1		I must say that after reading this book, I am more confused than ever as to the origins of the war between Japan and the US. <sssss> The book starts in 1936, although most knowledgable people know that the march to war really began with the Japanese seizure of Manchuria in 1932. <sssss> The author continually repeats the refrain that "Americans don't understand the Japanese mentality and culture", and it was this "misunderstanding" that led to the war. <sssss> It is true that Toland defines the Japanese term "gekokujo" as being some sort of "insubordination" that led to the Kwantung Army to feel it could move, presumably without orders from Tokyo, into Manchuria. <sssss> However, Toland does not explain how this could happen. <sssss> There is little description of the power structure in Japan, we do know that there was some attempt to create parliamentary democracy, but there were also the giant oligarchs who had much power, plus the military hierarchy. <sssss> Somehow, the military took control in the 1930's, but Toland doesn't really say how. <sssss> He describes in detail the "2/26" Uprising of young officers in 1936, and how they were willing to kill without compunction, and how fanatical they were, yet we are then told that they OPPOSED expansion into China, and that the repression of this coup attempt would lead to an expanded war in China. <sssss> I must say I don't understand this at all...Toland potrays them as militaristic fanatics, yet they seem to be "the good guys". <sssss> Weren't those who supported expansion into China also militaristic fanatics? <sssss> This is left totally unexplained. <sssss> Toland then goes on to describe the fatal "Incident at the Marco Polo Bridge" in 1937 near Peking (Beijing) which led to the full-scale invasion of China. <sssss> Toland says the government in Tokyo, again, had nothing to do with it, in fact both the Chinese and Japanese commanders on the spot tried to calm things down, but some undefined "hotheads" (possibly Chinese Communists) kept inflaming the situation. <sssss> Somehow (without Toland telling us how), a decision is made by someone (not necessarily the "peace-loving" Japanese Prime Minister Prince Konoye) to mount a full-scale invasion of China. <sssss> An impression is left by Toland that the Chinese, particulary, the Koumintang government of Chiang Kai-shek was provocative and unreasonable. <sssss> All I know is that that Marco Polo Bridge is within China, and it is understandable that the Chinese would resent the Japanese military presence there. <sssss> After this, we move on to the atrocities of the "Rape of Nanking", which again, according to Toland, "somehow" happens, (Toland does admit that there were atrocities and between 200,000 and 300,000 Chinese were butchered by their "brother Asians" who claimed to be liberating them(?)). <sssss> Toland says the Japanese commander at Nanking did not order any such behavior, nor again, did the government in Tokyo. <sssss> How then do thousands of supposedly disciplined Japanese troops suddenly get it into their heads to do such things? <sssss> Toland doesn't give us a clue, other than his general statement that "westerners don't understand the Japanese". <sssss> Toland also, in a way, tries to claim that Western opposition to Japanese expansion into China was "hypocritical" because of Western Colonialism in East Asia (US in the Philippines; Britain in Hong Kong, Malaya, Burma, India; Dutch in East Indies; French in Indochina), however, by the 1930's the US had already agreed to give the Philippines independence and the British were beginning to wind down the Raj in India was setting up an autonomous Indian government, so it was apparent that Colonialism was already on its way out before the war. <sssss> All this makes me wonder about the various things he says in the book, and I would look for a better source on the tragic history of this period. <sssss> I have read his books on the end of both World War I and World War II which are much better, so that adds to my disappointment
SpookyChick		McDonald's: Behind the Arches: Books: John F. Love		2		McDonald's is one of the great symbols of America, and most countries around the world absolutely love McDonald's. <sssss> If you want to know the history of the mega-giant corporation, this is a good starting place. <sssss> We are capitalists in America - we love making money, and that can only be considered a good thing. <sssss> McDonald's embodies much of the American spirit and American dream. <sssss> Sure, the food isn't healthy - as if that's a newflash for anyone these days. <sssss> But eating it in moderation is not harmful in any way. <sssss> Oh, and westcoaster (below) didn't actually read this book prior to reviewing it - that person just has a problem with successful business-people earning money. <sssss> If you don't have that problem, read the book and marvel at the entrepreneurial spirit. <sssss> And to Hades with the naysayers - come to think of it, I'm outta here - gotta grab a Quarter Pounder with cheese, baby
Grant S. Le Sage		How the Mind Works (Penguin Press Science): Books: Steven Pinker		1		This was another Pinker book I couldn't finish. <sssss> If he was a taxi-driver he would take you from Brooklyn to New York via San Francisco. <sssss> Sometimes even his asides have asides! <sssss> Perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word
FoxyTubaChick " pppppppppp #60;3 amanda"		Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Adventures of a Curious Character): Books: Richard P. Feynman,Ralph Leighton,Edward Hutchings,Albert R. Hibbs		1		Coming from a 16 year old girl that has to read this book for a school project...I would have to say that this book is kind of boring. <sssss> If your into physics and science and all that jazz then you will most likely enjoy this book. <sssss> But if you're going to read it just to read it, then I would suggest you not. <sssss> I have to admit, that some of the stuff Richard Feynman says is funny but I found my self skipping pages at a time because of its boringness. <sssss> Don't get me wrong, I really do admire Mr. Feynman as a man and he was a great physicist but this book was just ok. <sssss> Sometimes he got into a lot of in-depth physics stuff that I just didn't care for. <sssss> But sometimes i was interested in what he was saying. <sssss> Have a nice da
N. J. Peck "thespian"		Simply Christian: Why Christianity Makes Sense: Books: N.T. Wright		1		This book tries to convince non-Christian skeptics but seems to spend too much time justifying orthodox perceptions and concepts of prayer and liturgy, without addressing fundamental objections
Christian Schlect		Dean Acheson: A Life in the Cold War: Books: Robert L. Beisner		2		A very solid and balanced recounting of the career in power of one of the most important diplomatic figures of the past one hundred years. <sssss> In his book, Professor Beisner wisely concentrates almost entirely on the twelve years Dean Acheson was in power in Washington, D.C. <sssss> The great issues grappled with in the immediate years after World War II still live with us today: Russia, Germany, Vietnam, Japan, North Korea, Israel, Iran, France, and China/Taiwan. <sssss> If you are curious to know why some things are the way they are in today's world, read this book. <sssss> The number of key foreign policy challenges that flew at this talented Secretary of State is astonishing

Karen Swingler		I'll Always Love You: Books: Hans Wilhelm		2		I always need tissues when I read this book! <sssss> It has helped so much! <sssss> I teach preschool and one of my students lost his dog. <sssss> I gave him this book and Dog Heaven. <sssss> His parents said how much both books helped. <sssss> It is just so hard for children to understand death. <sssss> I think this book goes a long way in validating a child's feelings. <sssss> So often children don't know what to feel, they know grief, but there is so much more than that. <sssss> It truly helps when children know it's ok to be confused, hurt, and just upset. <sssss> I HIGHLY recommend this book
S. Showalter "Christian reader"		Jesus I Never Knew, The: Books: Philip Yancey		1		I would not neccessarily call this book "Christian". <sssss> It is more of an historical account, Bible as literature type of book. <sssss> It does make you think about different aspects of Jesus life, but most of that is speculation or perception. <sssss> Yancey leaves the reader hopeless at the end.
Ben Coats		Lonely Planet Iceland: Books: Joe Bindloss,Paul Handing		1		This is not one of Lonely Planet's best guides. <sssss> There is suprisingly little information. <sssss> For example, the book mentions that there are a few companies that give day tours from Rekyavik but doesnt tell you anything about how they compare in price or services. <sssss> basically, everything in the guide and more can be found at the tourist information center in Rekyavik, which luckily is run very well. <sssss> I found this really disappointing since Iceland is very expensive and I was hoping to keep down costs (in reality this is almost impossible, even eating at the grocery store I was spending 10 dollars a meal for bread and cheese) Furthermore, Iceland is a very small country and it would have been very easy to have given a lot more details. <sssss> As with any tour book some of the info is out of date. <sssss> some of the museums and businesses were closed including the Icelandic Phallogical Museum. <sssss> It also seemed that this book was written for the high season in the summer months. <sssss> I went in March and found the information on the offseason limited and sometimes inaccurate. <sssss> I usually trust Lonely Planet but in this case I would have tried one of the other guide book companies or simply visit the tourist center when you get there.
Morgan		A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing): Books: Kate L. Turabian		1		Overall I found this guide pretty confusing, but I guess it is better than nothing. <sssss> There are better choices, and some may want to consider auto-formatting software such as Eazypaper and others.
Dottie Randazzo "reader of everything"		The Millionaire Mind: Books: Thomas J. Stanley,Cotter Smith		2		This book gives insight to how the mind with a purpose (of being a millionare)looks at everything he does. <sssss> An easy read and highly recommended
Alfred Johnson		Literature and Revolution: Books: Leon Trotsky,William Keach		2		Trotsky once wrote that of the three great tragedies in life- hunger, sex and death- revolutionary Marxism, which was the driving force behind his life and work, mainly concerned itself with the struggle against hunger. <sssss> That observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the Marxist tradition. <sssss> However, as Trotsky demonstrates here, Marxist methodology cannot and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle. <sssss> Here Trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development. <sssss> In a healthy post-capitalist society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged. <sssss> If the task of socialism were merely to vastly expand economic equality, in a sense, it would be a relativity simple task for a healthy socialist society in concert with other like-minded societies to provide general economic equality with a little tweaking after vanquishing the capitalism mode of production. <sssss> What Marxism aimed for, and Trotsky defends here, is a prospect that with the end of class society and economic and social injustice the capacity of individual human beings to reach new heights of intellectual and creative development would flourish. <sssss> That is the thought that underpins Trotsky's work here as he analyzes various trends in Russian literature in the immediate aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. <sssss> In short, Marxism is certainly not a method to be followed in order to write great literature but it does allow one to set that literature in its social context and interrelatedness. <sssss> You will find no Deconstructionist or other fashionable literary criticism here. <sssss> Quite the contrary. <sssss> Here Trotsky uses his finely tuned skill as a Marxist to great effect as he analyzes the various trends of literature as they were affected (or not affected) by the October Revolution and sniffs out what in false in some of the literary trends. <sssss> Mainly at the time of writing the jury was still out about the prospects of many of these trends. <sssss> He analyzes many of the trends that became important later in the century in world literature, like futurism and constructivism, and others- some of which have disappeared and some of which still survive. <sssss> The most important and lasting polemic which Trotsky raised here, however, was the fight against the proponents of `proletarian culture'. <sssss> The argument put forth by this trend maintained that since the Soviet Union was a workers state those who wrote about working class themes or were workers themselves should in the interest of cultural development be given special status and encouragement (read a monopoly on the literary front). <sssss> Trotsky makes short shrift of this argument by noting that, in theory at least as its turned out, the proletarian state was only a transitional state and therefore no lasting `proletarian culture' would have time to develop. <sssss> Although history did not turn out to prove Trotsky correct the polemic is still relevant to any theory of mass cultural development. <sssss> One of the results of the publication of this book is that many intellectuals, particularly Western intellectuals, based some of their sympathy for Trotsky the man and fallen hero on his literary analysis and his ability to write. <sssss> This was particularly true during the 1930's here in America where those who were anti-Stalinist but were repelled by the vacuity of the Socialist Party were drawn to him. <sssss> A few, like James T. Farrell (Studs Lonigan trilogy), did this mostly honorably. <sssss> Most, like Dwight MacDonald and Sidney Hooks, etc. <sssss> did not and simply used that temporary sympathy as a way station on their way to anti-Communism. <sssss> Such is the nature of the political struggle. <sssss> A note for the politically- inclined who read this book. <sssss> Trotsky wrote this book in 1923-24 at the time of Lenin's death and later while the struggle for succession by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev was in full swing. <sssss> While Trotsky did not recognize it until later (nor did others, for that matter) this period represented the closing of the rising tide of the revolution. <sssss> Hereafter, the people who ruled the Soviet Union, the purposes for which they ruled and the manner in which they ruled changed dramatically. <sssss> In short, Thermidor in the classical French revolutionary expression was victorious. <sssss> Given his political position why the hell was he writing a book on literary trends in post-revolutionary society at that time.
Glenn E. Austin		The Billion Dollar BET: Robert Johnson and the Inside Story of Black Entertainment Television: Books: Brett Pulley		2		This book was very candid and well written. <sssss> It shows that Bob primary goal was to build a business, and become rich and he succeed. <sssss> The idea that he sold it as a media for African American pride is what got him in trouble. <sssss> Pulley shows that it was pppppppppp quot;strictly business pppppppppp quot; Mr. Johnson need not so defensive, what he created made him rich, this book shows that wealth does not equal respect? <sssss> Nevertheless he has $3 billion dollars and hopefully plenty of time to write a final chapter of which he can be prou
Jon Deepcreek		Tropic of Cancer: Books: Henry Miller,Martin Balsam		1		This book is filthy. <sssss> I had to take a shower after I read it. <sssss> Why doesn't he get a job? <sssss> Why does he have to live in France? <sssss> Why doesn't he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers? <sssss> So many questions. <sssss> People just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say James Michenier because it was banned. <sssss> It was banned because it's a bad book
careful reader "SY"		Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer: Books: Scott Eyman		2		Not only a terrific portrait of Louis B. Mayer, but a wonderful history of Hollywood movie-making. <sssss> My caveat is the portrait of Dore Schary. <sssss> While Eyman is fair in his depiction of the struggle between Mayer and Thalberg, Eyman found it necessary to choose sides in the Mayer Schary conflict in the last part of the book, possibly to "correct" the view of Mayer the Monster and Schary the savior in earlier Mayer bios. <sssss> His portrait of Schary, a man I knew, bears no resemblance to that decent, fair minded, and gifted man. <sssss> It is clear that he interviewed few surviving friends and family members of Schary. <sssss> Eyman claims that Schary had no knowledge of the making of musicals, yet Schary in his post MGM days produced a successful musical, "The Unsinkable Molly Brown." <sssss> Whatever good flims came from MGM during Schary's reign are dismissed as the work of others. <sssss> He creates a portrait of Schary as a talentless hack, forgetting not only the good films Schary wrote in earlier days but the successful Broadway play he wrote about FDR, "Sunrise at Campabello." <sssss> He writes that Schary only spoke of himself in retirement. <sssss> I knew few older men who took such an interst in world affairs and the fortunes and misfortunes of his friends. <sssss> If he can get Schary so wrong, it forces me to question his other judgments. <sssss> Having said all that, I think this is a fine book, evoking old Hollywood with grace and style.
Jonathan G. Curtis "game player and book reader"		New Rules for the New Economy: Books: Kevin Kelly		2		Offers 10 rules for organizations to follow to benefit from the emerging Economy. <sssss> The book is really just a condensed version of Kelly's earlier book, Out of Control
Ajay Patel		Hacker's Challenge : Test Your Incident Response Skills Using 20 Scenarios: Books: Mike Schiffman		2		The Challenge/Solution style of these books are great for security beginners as well as seasoned professionals. <sssss> If you read carefully you can pick up many hints/tools which you can use in real life security scenarios. <sssss> My only -ve comment about this book is its getting out of date now. <sssss> Many of the incidents described are not relevant now, as security practices at most firms would thrawt these incidents. <sssss> Having said that, the scenarios are still good for security beginners. <sssss> For advanced readers I would suggest the Second edition or the soon to be released third edition
Xavier Abad		The Iron Hand of Mars: A Marcus Didius Falco Mystery: Books: Lindsey Davis		2		I read this book in less than one week. <sssss> Normally I spend and average time of a month in finishing a book, but this was one of the pppppppppp quot;rare pppppppppp quot; cases that the reading last until 2 am. <sssss> Marcus travels to a wild land, Germania Libera in order to send a gift of the emperor and ends with his life in hands of a German sorceress. <sssss> The full novel is filled with action and historical references, it's worth the money!
T. Brady		Haunted: Books: Chuck Palahniuk		1		Yuk!!! <sssss> Worst Book I've ever read - I read alot and with alot of variety. <sssss> This book stinks (too farfetched, retched, disgusting and plain weird).
Molly O'Halloran		Hard Truth (Anna Pigeon): Books: Nevada Barr,Joyce Bean		1		I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries. <sssss> The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it. <sssss> It is a very unpleasant experience. <sssss> The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill. What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area. <sssss> I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park. <sssss> Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story. <sssss> The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago. <sssss> I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them. <sssss> This book, however, was truely repulsive. <sssss> I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book
Anne C. Bullock		Rise and Shine: A Novel: Books: Anna Quindlen		1		This book was selected by my book club. <sssss> I had never read Anna Quindlen before. <sssss> Rise and Shine was a disappointment to me. <sssss> I kept hoping that Meghan would somehow be redeemed, but that did not happen. <sssss> She is really not very likeable. <sssss> I thought there would have been more of a dialog between the sisters concerning Leo's tradgedy. <sssss> Meghan blamed her sister in one line and then it was never brought up again. <sssss> The book left me with an empty feeling. <sssss> It was not a satisfying read
